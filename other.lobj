However, that latest numbers show that up to 7 percent of suspected Reichsbürger still have a permit to own sporting or hunting rifles — far higher than the national average of 2 percent.\n\nRead more: Germany\'s Reichsbürger movement out to \'delegitimize the state\'\n\nReichsbürger numbers on the up\n\nDespite the crackdown on armed members, official figures show the total number of Reichsbürger continues to rise, with authorities having identified around 18,400, suspected members, some 900 of whom are believed to be radical right-wing extremists.\n\nHowever, Maassen stressed that the uptick in numbers also accounted for the authorities\' efforts in identifying previously unknown members. "The rise in numbers in the past three months shows that our increased focus on the Reichsbürger scene is paying off," he said.\n\nGerman security services have increased their monitoring of the far-right scene over the past two years following a spate of violent attacks on the public and police.\n\nRead more: German police bust human trafficking ring linked to Reichsbürger scene\n\nThe movement gained significant traction after a member shot dead a policeman in Bavaria in October 2016.\n\nA few months later, a member in the southwestern city of Trier shot a soft-air rifle in a public square and threatened several passers-by. Since then, several officers have been injured in police operations against members. The most recently, last month, saw several Reichsbürger clash with police after a protest in Erlenbach in the state of Baden-Württemberg, turned violent.\n\nSeveral public sector workers across Germany have also been identified as members of the far-right group.\n\nThe Reichsbürger movement in Germany What do Reichsbürger believe? Reichsbürger translates to "citizens of the Reich." What unites this loose movement is rejection of the modern Federal Republic of Germany. They believe the 1937 or 1871 borders of the German Empire still exist and today\'s country is an administrative construct still occupied by the Allied powers. Many subscribe to far-right or anti-Semitic ideologies. Their conspiracy theories have been debunked.\n\nThe Reichsbürger movement in Germany How much of a threat are they? The Reichsbürger scene is a disparate, leaderless movement totalling about 15,000 supporters, according to German intelligence officials. Of those, about 900 have been identified as far-right extremists and 1,000 have a license to own firearms. Authorities are concerned about some members\' potential to become violent and have conducted several raids on Reichsbürger suspects to sieze weapons.\n\nThe Reichsbürger movement in Germany Who are its members? One was Mr. Germany Adrian Ursache, a 42-year-old former winner of the Mister Germany beauty pageant, is also a Reichsbürger member. He is currently facing trial for attempted murder after an August 2016 gun battle with police as they tried to evict him from his home. Typically, Reichsbürger refuse to recognize any state apparatus, printing their own passports and driving licenses.\n\nThe Reichsbürger movement in Germany Jailed for murder The case of Wolfgang P., who in October 2017 was sentenced to life in prison for murdering a police officer, is seen as a turning point for how German authorities deal with the extremist group. P., an alleged Reichsbürger member, shot at officers who were raiding his home to confiscate weapons.\n\nThe Reichsbürger movement in Germany What are the authorities doing about it? German authorities have been accused of long underestimating the threat posed by the Reichsbürger. Since the murder of the police officer in Bavaria, law enforcement has been cracking down on them more vigorously. In the past year there have been several raids on Reichsbürger targets. Some German police and military forces have also probed whether they may have Reichsbürger among their own ranks.

We can’t do it for them.”\n\nCanada’s lonely stance was swiftly noticed north of the border. “We do not have a single friend in the whole entire world,” Rachel Curran, a policy director under former Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper, lamented on Twitter.\n\nThe UK was similarly muted in its response, noted Bob Rae, a former leader of the federal Liberal party. “The Brits and the Trumpians run for cover and say ‘we’re friends with both the Saudis and the Canadians,’” Rae wrote on Twitter. “Thanks for the support for human rights, guys, and we’ll remember this one for sure.”\n\nThe spat appeared to have been sparked last week when Canada’s foreign ministry expressed its concern over the arrest of Saudi civil society and women’s rights activists, in a tweet that echoed concerns previously voiced by the United Nations.\n\nSaudi Arabia swiftly shot back, expelling Canada’s ambassador and suspending new trade and investment with Ottawa, making plans to remove thousands of Saudi students and medical patients from Canada, and suspending the state airline’s flights to and from Canada, among other actions.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister urged Canada to “fix its big mistake” and warned that the kingdom was considering additional measures against Canada.\n\nAnalysts and regional officials said the spat had little to do with Canada, instead characterising Riyadh’s actions as a broader signal to western governments that any criticism of its domestic policies is unacceptable.\n\nSeveral countries expressed support for Saudi Arabia, including Egypt and Russia. But Canada continued to stand alone, even as state-run media in the kingdom reported the beheading and “crucifixion” of a man convicted of killing a woman and carrying out other crimes.\n\nJustin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister, said Canada was continuing to engage diplomatically and politically with Saudi Arabia. “We have respect for their importance in the world and recognise that they have made progress on a number of important issues,” he told reporters this week.\n\nHe insisted, however, that his government would continue to press Saudi Arabia on its human rights record. “We will, at the same time, continue to speak clearly and firmly on issues of human rights at home and abroad wherever we see the need.”\n\nIn this particular dispute, Canada did not need US help, said Thomas Juneau, a professor at the University of Ottawa. “Saudi Arabia-Canada relations are very limited, so there’s not a lot of damage being done to Canada right now,” he said. “But this should be a source of major anxiety: when a real crisis comes and we are alone, what do we do?”\n\nSaudi critics jab Canada on Twitter and TV as diplomatic feud deepens Read more\n\nThe week’s events have added impetus to a conversation that is slowly getting under way in Canada, Juneau said. “We are starting some serious soul-searching in the sense of what does it mean for Canada to have a US that is much more unilateral, much more dismissive of the rules and the norms and of its leadership role in the international order that it has played for 70 years?”\n\nThese changes south of the border have clearly emboldened Saudi Arabia, Juneau argued, describing the kingdom’s recent actions in Yemen, Qatar and Lebanon as a pattern of aggressive, ambitious and reckless behaviour.\n\nHe saw no immediate end to the row, particularly as neither side is suffering significant costs in the dispute. Saudi Arabia has shown little inclination in recent years to walk back from its reckless and impulsive behaviour, he said, while Canada’s federal government – facing an election in 14 months and already under fire for signing off on the sale of more than 900 armoured vehicles to Riyadh – is loath to be seen adopting any kind of conciliatory posture towards the conservative kingdom.\n\nWhile some in Canada had been disappointed to see the UK and Europe opt to publicly stay out of the diplomatic spat, Juneau described it as unsurprising. “When Saudi Arabia had comparable fights with Sweden and Germany in recent years, did Canada go out of its way to side with Sweden and Germany? No, not at all,” he said. “We stayed quiet because we had nothing to gain from getting involved. So on the European side, the calculation is the same.”\n\nCanada’s lonely stand for women’s rights in the kingdom did earn the support of some around the world; this week saw the Guardian and the New York Times publish editorials urging Europe and the US to stand with Canada. So did the Washington Post, going one step further by publishing their editorial in Arabic.\n\nTheir call was echoed by a handful of prominent voices in the US, including Bernie Sanders. “It’s entirely legitimate for democratic governments to highlight human rights issues with undemocratic governments,” the US senator wrote on Twitter. “The US must be clear in condemning repression, especially when done by governments that receive our support.”', 'title': '‘We don’t have a single friend’: Canada’s Saudi spat reveals country is alone', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/11/canada-saudi-arabia-support-us', 'keywords': ['governments', 'canadas', 'canada', 'country', 'reveals', 'friend', 'support', 'week', 'arabia', 'rights', 'single', 'saudi', 'human', 'dont', 'juneau', 'spat'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': '“It’s up for the government of Saudi Arabia and the Canadians to work this out,” state department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said this week.\nSeveral countries expressed support for Saudi Arabia, including Egypt and Russia.\nJustin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister, said Canada was continuing to engage diplomatically and politically with Saudi Arabia.\nHe insisted, however, that his government would continue to press Saudi Arabia on its human rights record.\n“It’s entirely legitimate for democratic governments to highlight human rights issues with undemocratic governments,” the US senator wrote on Twitter.', 'date': 1533945600}, {'text': 'Farmer John Duffy (left) and Roger Murphy load soybeans from a grain bin onto a truck before taking them to a grain elevator on June 13, in Dwight, Illinois.

If other countries become reliable suppliers for China, it will be very difficult for the U.S. to regain the market,” Han Jun told official Xinhua news agency in an interview on Friday.\n\nHe also warned that American farmers could lose the position in the Chinese market they have spent several decades building up. Han said they may not be able to make up the losses brought by retaliatory tariffs, even with the White House’s planned $12 billion aid package for farmers caught in the dispute.\n\nSign up for Morning Trade A speed read on global trade news — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Beijing unveiled its latest retaliatory tariffs on $16 billion of American goods on Wednesday, matching Washington’s move to slap 25 percent duties on the same value of Chinese imports.\n\nThe vice agriculture minister also said Chinese companies had “basically stopped” importing soybeans from U.S. farmers since July 6 and would deal with the impact by finding alternative ingredients for animal feeds.\n\nChina is the world’s biggest importer of soybeans, which it uses to make cooking oil, biodiesel and the meal to feed livestock.\n\nHan said the country was expecting soybean imports from the U.S. to drop dramatically this year and that preparations had already been made. “China is totally able to handle the shortfall created by a drop in American soybean imports,” Han told Xinhua.\n\nChina has been buying more soybeans from other countries and promoting alternatives to soybeans to feed livestock, as well as pushing farmers to plant more domestic crops. Before the trade war erupted, China was on track to import 300 million tons of soybeans from the United States this year.\n\nThe country imported about $24.1 billion of agricultural products from the United States last year, accounting for 19 percent of its total farm imports worth some $125.86 billion, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs.\n\nHan said that starting from July 6, Beijing had imposed 25 percent tariffs on 517 types of American agricultural products — including nuts, soybeans, cotton, fruit and meat. Their combined value last year was about $21 billion, he said.\n\nHe also warned that additional duties on American agricultural goods were in the pipeline.\n\nBeijing has said it is ready to impose tariffs on $60 billion of American products if President Donald Trump — who has accused China of amassing a huge trade surplus through unfair trade practices — goes ahead with plans to slap extra duties on $200 billion of Chinese goods.\n\nThe next list will include 387 types of agricultural products – including coffee, vegetables and vegetable oils – which last year had a total value of around $2.9 billion.\n\nAs a result, almost all agricultural products China buys from the U.S. will face additional tariffs once Beijing’s latest countermeasures take effect, Han said.\n\nThe European Union would not be able to make up the losses for U.S. soybean producers, who will be left with a huge surplus without China buying the grain from them, according to Han. He said although the EU had agreed to import more soybeans from America, it would only buy 13 million to 14 million tons of soybeans a year over the next decade, according to estimates — compared with the more than 30 million tons of the grain China bought from the U.S. last year.\n\nBut Han admitted that Washington’s tariffs would impact China’s fruit, vegetable and seafood producers because it would not be easy for them to find alternative export destinations in the short term. He said Beijing would help exporters find other countries to sell their products to and try to boost domestic consumption instead, to minimize the impact of the tariffs.\n\nThe United States was the third largest market for Chinese fruit and fifth largest for vegetables last year, with the exports valued at a combined $1.84 billion.', 'title': 'China says U.S. farmers may never regain market share lost in trade war', 'url': 'https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/11/farmers-china-soy-bean-market-share-734773', 'keywords': ['han', 'war', 'china', 'share', 'tariffs', 'american', 'lost', 'trade', 'billion', 'soybeans', 'agricultural', 'regain', 'products', 'farmers', 'market'], 'tags': {'China', 'Rich Lowry', 'Employment & Immigration', 'Cartoon Carousel', 'U.S.-China Relations', 'South China Morning Post', 'Tariffs', 'Jack Shafer'}, 'summary': '| Scott Olson/Getty Images China says U.S. farmers may never regain market share lost in trade warThis story is being published by POLITICO as part of a content partnership with the South China Morning Post.\nIf other countries become reliable suppliers for China, it will be very difficult for the U.S. to regain the market,” Han Jun told official Xinhua news agency in an interview on Friday.\n“Levying additional tariffs will cause a great decrease in exports of U.S. agricultural products to China,” Han said.\nHe also warned that additional duties on American agricultural goods were in the pipeline.\nAs a result, almost all agricultural products China buys from the U.S. will face additional tariffs once Beijing’s latest countermeasures take effect, Han said.', 'date': 1533945600}, {'text': 'Trump Administration Seeks to Withhold Millions in Aid to Palestinians\n\nThe White House is seeking to withhold up to $200 million in relief aid for Palestinian civilians in Gaza and the West Bank, severing a vital humanitarian lifeline at a time of rising political and security tensions in the area, according to three diplomatic sources.\n\nThe amount represents nearly all of the humanitarian aid the United States provides directly to the Palestinians. Washington also contributes to the budget of a United Nations agency that helps Palestinian refugees known as UNRWA, but the administration has slashed that aid and appears to have no immediate plans to provide more.\n\nThe decision coincides with a wave of pay cuts and layoffs for hundreds of U.N. and other international aid workers in the West Bank and Gaza—the latter of which is facing its most dire humanitarian crisis in years. Palestinian employees seized control of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East’s headquarters in Gaza last month after it announced the layoffs.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and top Middle East advisor, decided on the cuts in a high-level meeting earlier this week.\n\nCongress had already appropriated $230 million in economic support funds for private relief groups in Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem. But the officials decided they would ask lawmakers to withhold most of the funds, according to the diplomatic sources, who preferred not to be identified discussing sensitive issues.\n\nA State Department spokesperson said “we have nothing to announce at this time.” A National Security Council spokesperson cautioned that “no decision has been made.”\n\nThe cut will affect scores of programs administered by nongovernmental charities in the West Bank and Gaza, including CARE, Catholic Relief Services, International Medical Corps, and Mercy Corps. The groups provide food, medical equipment, and services. It would also likely kill off key programs of the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nThe sources said the administration intends to continue funding a network of six hospitals in East Jerusalem, which receive over $25 million in annual U.S. contributions.\n\n“It’s like a perfect storm of developments building toward the worst situation we have seen in decades in Gaza,” said Andy Dwonch, the mission director for Mercy Corps in Palestine, which has already had to give notice to 13 employees.\n\n“What we really worry about is our ability to respond” to another major flare-up of violence.\n\nPompeo initially opposed the sweeping cuts, arguing that it would be better to redirect U.S. funding to other international relief efforts. But Kushner pushed back, maintaining that ending the assistance outright could strengthen his negotiating hand when he introduces his long-awaited Middle East peace plan, according to sources.\n\nThe U.S. executive branch is required by law to spend money appropriated by Congress. But one method under consideration to get around the law is to put the money in a “rescission package” and tell Congress it doesn’t need to spend it.\n\nUnder Congress’s procedural rules, legislators would have 45 days to decide to back the administration’s request. But in this case, even if they make no decision, the expiration would coincide with the end of the fiscal year, at which point the money could no longer be spent.\n\n“This is counterproductive,” Dave Harden, a former USAID mission director for the West Bank and Gaza, said of the aid cuts. “We are leaving a political vacuum and ceding the space to Hamas and other rejectionists.”\n\nEarlier this year, the Trump administration cut funding for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, which provides essential food and services to more than 5 million Palestinian refugees across the Middle East—transferring to the agency less than half of its initial annual installment $125 million.\n\nAt the time, the State Department announced it intended to conduct a review of the U.S. funding for UNRWA, claiming UNRWA needed to demonstrate a willingness to undertake unspecified reforms.\n\nBut internal White House emails disclosed last Friday by Foreign Policy suggested that Kushner and other White House officials were exploring ways to dismantle UNRWA. In one of the emails, Kushner described the U.N. agency as “corrupt, inefficient and doesn’t help peace.”\n\nThe Trump administration wants other governments, particularly wealthy Gulf Arab states, to help cover UNRWA’s costs.\n\nUNRWA’s spokesman, Chris Gunness, told FP that many other states have taken up some of the slack, noting that an “unprecedented” $200 million in new funds have been committed to the U.N. refugee program since January, including $100 million from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Another $38 million has been pledged by Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, the Holy See, Ireland, Malta, the United Kingdom, and the European Union.

Ultimately, SZ acquired about 2.6 terabytes of data, making the leak the biggest that journalists had ever worked with. The source wanted neither financial compensation nor anything else in return, apart from a few security measures. The data provides rare insights into a world that can only exist in the shadows.

The data primarily comprises e-mails, pdf files, photo files, and excerpts of an internal Mossack Fonseca database. It covers a period spanning from the 1970s to the spring of 2016. The Panama Papers include approximately 11.5 million documents –\n\nMoreover, the journalists crosschecked a large number of documents, including passport copies. About two years ago, a whistleblower had already sold internal Mossack Fonseca data to the German authorities, but the dataset was much older and smaller in scope: while it addressed a few hundred offshore companies, the Panama Papers provide data on some 214,000 companies. In the wake of the data purchase, last year investigators searched the homes and offices of about 100 people. The Commerzbank was also raided. As a consequence of their business dealings with Mossack Fonseca, Commerzbank, HSH Nordbank, and Hypovereinsbank agreed to pay fines of around 20 million euros, respectively. Since then, other countries have also acquired data from the initial smaller leak, among them the United States, the UK, and Iceland. The system The leaked data is structured as follows: Mossack Fonseca created a folder for each shell firm. Each folder contains e-mails, contracts, transcripts, and scanned documents. In some instances, there are several thousand pages of documentation. First, the data had to be systematically indexed to make searching through this sea of information possible. To this end, the Süddeutsche Zeitung used Süddeutsche Zeitung and ICIJ uploaded millions of documents onto high-performance computers. They applied optical character recognition (OCR) to transform data into machine-readable and easy to search files. The process turned images – such as scanned IDs and signed contracts – into searchable text. This was an important step: it enabled journalists to comb through as large a portion of the leak as possible using a simple search mask similar to Google.

The journalists compiled lists of important politicians, international criminals, and well-known professional athletes, among others. The digital processing made it possible to then search the leak for the names on these lists. The "party donations scandal" list contained 130 names, and the UN sanctions list more than 600.

For each name found, a detailed research process was initiated that posed the following questions: what is this person’s role in the network of companies? Where does the money come from? Where is it going? Is this structure legal? Generally speaking, owning an offshore company is not illegal in itself. In fact, establishing an offshore company can be seen as a logical step for a broad range of business transactions. However, a look through the Panama Papers very quickly reveals that concealing the identities of the true company owners was the primary aim in the vast majority of cases. From the outset, the journalists had their work cut out for them. The providers of offshore companies – among them banks, lawyers, and investment advisors – often keep their clients’ names secret and use proxies. In turn, the proxies’ tracks then lead to heads of state, important officials, and millionaires. Over the course of the international project, journalists cooperated with one another to investigate thousands of leads: they examined evidence, studied contracts, and spoke with experts. Among others, Mossack Fonsecas’ clients include criminals and members of various Mafia groups. The documents also expose bribery scandals and corrupt heads of state and government. The alleged offshore companies of twelve current and former heads of state make up one of the most spectacular parts of the leak, as do the links to other leaders, and to their families, closest advisors, and friends. The Panamanian law firm also counts almost 200 other politicians from around the globe among its clients, including a number of ministers.\n\nThe company The company at the center of all these stories is Mossack Fonseca, a Panamanian provider of offshore companies with dozens of offices all over the world. It sells its shell firms in cities such as Zurich, London, and Hong Kong – in some instances at bargain prices. Clients can buy an anonymous company for as little as USD 1,000. However, at this price it is just an empty shell. For an extra fee, Mossack Fonseca provides a sham director and, if desired, conceals the company’s true shareholder. The result is an offshore company whose true purpose and ownership structure is indecipherable from the outside. Mossack Fonseca has founded, sold, and managed thousands of companies. The documents provide a detailed view of how Mossack Fonseca routinely accepts to engage in business activities that potentially violate sanctions, in addition to aiding and abetting tax evasion and money laundering.

"FCC Chairman Ajit Pai\'s scorched-earth plan for net neutrality displays callous disregard for both process and substance. The chairman\'s plan to do away with net neutrality will be a disaster for consumers and yet another handout for big business."\n\nMatt Wood, policy director at Free Press, said Pai\'s plan "makes no sense" for a variety of key reasons.\n\n\n\n"Internet rights are civil rights.

It ignores the law and the courts, which have repeatedly upheld the 2015 Title II rules. And it ignores the vibrancy of the internet marketplace following adoption of that 2015 order, with incontrovertible economic data showing that both investment in networks and online innovation are flourishing under the very same rules Pai wants to destroy," Wood said.\n\n#NetNeutrality is NOT DEAD YET.

"Gutting net neutrality will have a devastating effect on free speech online. Without it, gateway corporations like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T will have too much power to mess with the free flow of information."\n\nThe praise Pai\'s plan quickly attracted from major corporations appeared to vindicate critics\' concerns that the Republican-controlled FCC is working to deliver a massive "handout to big business." In a statement on Tuesday, Verizon said it is "very encouraged" by the proposed return to "light-touch" regulation—disregarding the fact that opinion polls have clearly and consistently shown that American consumers favor net neutrality.\n\nBut if Pai\'s announcement on Tuesday is any evidence, he gives public opinion very little weight. As Devin Coldewey of Tech Crunch notes, Pai "made no mention of the inconvenient and embarrassing fact that his proposal had attracted historic attention, garnering over 22 million comments—the majority of which opposed it."\n\n"There can be no truly open internet without net neutrality. To believe otherwise is to be captive to special interest power brokers."\n\n—Michael Copps, Common Cause\n\nIf Pai\'s proposals are approved—the FCC is expected to vote on December 14—companies like Verizon and AT&T will be given extremely broad leeway to charge consumers more for internet access, products, and services while facing less oversight.\n\nIn addition to reversing the classification of the internet as a public utility, Pai\'s plan would strip the FCC of enforcement power and effectively rely on what critics have derided as an "honor system," under which corporations will be responsible for transparently reporting their practices.\n\n"Relying more heavily on Internet providers\' own promises on net neutrality is a departure from the current rules, which lay out clear, federal bans against selectively blocking or slowing websites, as well as speeding up websites that agree to pay the providers a fee," observes the Washington Post\'s Brian Fung.\n\nCopps of Common Cause concluded that contrary to Pai\'s lofty rhetoric about "restoring internet freedom," the newly unveiled proposals would spell the end of the open internet.\n\n\n\n"There can be no truly open internet without net neutrality," Copps said in a statement on Tuesday. "To believe otherwise is to be captive to special interest power brokers or to an old and discredited ideology that thinks monopoly and not government oversight best serves the nation. In this case, I think it\'s both.

The site says the statement that appeared in the original report, stating that the "mixture of money and addiction is a game of chance," is descriptive of the investigation\'s intent rather than its conclusion.\n\nA report linked by the site acknowledges in its conclusion both the spread of loot boxes in videogames, and the difficulty in regulating them using current laws. As always, online translation is rough, but the report indicates that game operators can be "aggressive" with in-game sales and often target "young people." It also calls for "closer cooperation between governments, software developers, and rating agencies," and says that "with the right rules and consistent enforcement," it should be possible to "protect players from the harmful effects of gambling without compromising" the games themselves."\n\nIt seems a bit odd that the Justice Minister would comment on the matter and call for a ban before the investigation was completed, but it\'s possible that he\'s simply hoping to prod the process along on the path he thinks appropriate.\n\nAlso interesting is a line in the conclusion of the report regarding esports betting: That, apparently, falls more readily into the Gaming Commission\'s jurisdiction, and it is "therefore implementing a policy for esports betting." That very strongly (and unsurprisingly) suggests that the commission is looking at a lot more than just loot boxes.\n\nOriginal story:\n\nLast week, Belgium\'s Gaming Commission announced that it had launched an investigation into whether the loot boxes available for purchase in games like Overwatch and Star Wars Battlefront 2 constitute a form of gambling. Today, VTM News reported that the ruling is in, and the answer is yes.\n\nThe Google translation is a little sloppy, as usual, but the message is clear enough.

Belgium\'s Minister of Justice Koen Geens also weighed in, saying, "Mixing gambling and gaming, especially at a young age, is dangerous for the mental health of the child."\n\nGeens, according to the report, wants to ban in-game purchases outright (correction: if you don\'t know exactly what you\'re purchasing), and not just in Belgium: He said the process will take time, "because we have to go to Europe.

This could be ruinous for smaller companies that can’t afford to pay.\n\nNet neutrality is the law of the land in Canada, as the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission—which is responsible for regulating the country’s telecommunications companies, and is basically an equivalent to the FCC—has worked to strengthen its neutrality policies in recent years, taking aim at companies that try to use differential and discriminatory pricing or services to benefit their own business operations.\n\nEarlier this year, the Canadian regulator ruled against telecommunications giant Videotron after its unlimited music streaming plan gave preferential access to certain streaming companies.\n\n“A free and open Internet gives everyone a fair chance to innovate and for a vast array of content to be discovered by consumers,” then-chairman Jean-Pierre Blais said at the time.\n\nGet six of our favorite Motherboard stories every day by signing up for our newsletter.', 'title': 'Justin Trudeau Is ‘Very Concerned’ With FCC’s Plan to Roll Back Net Neutrality', 'url': 'https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ywb83y/justin-trudeau-is-very-concerned-with-fcc-plan-to-roll-back-net-neutrality-donald-trump', 'keywords': ['telecommunications', 'access', 'canadian', 'fccs', 'companies', 'net', 'roll', 'neutrality', 'internet', 'concerned', 'justin', 'plan', 'trudeau', 'consumers'], 'tags': {'Tech', 'CRTC', 'Health', 'net neutrality', 'Donald Trump', 'FCC', 'Read', 'Influence', 'JUSTIN TRUDEAU', 'Canada', 'Science', 'Hacking', 'Environment', 'Space', 'Internet', 'Moveable', 'Gaming'}, 'summary': 'Image: The Canadian Press/Chris YoungCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says President Donald Trump’s plan to roll back net neutrality protections for the internet “does not make sense” and that he’ll be looking into what he can do to defend net neutrality for the whole internet.\n“I am very concerned about the attacks on net neutrality,” Trudeau said in Toronto on Wednesday, in response to a question from Motherboard about Trump’s plans.\n“We need to continue to defend net neutrality,” Trudeau added.\nThe changes could also embolden the telecommunications giants to charge other companies to ensure access to their websites.\nEarlier this year, the Canadian regulator ruled against telecommunications giant Videotron after its unlimited music streaming plan gave preferential access to certain streaming companies.', 'date': 1511390194}, {'text': 'Some immunotherapy approaches rely on stimulating the immune system throughout the body. Others target naturally occurring checkpoints that limit the anti-cancer activity of immune cells. Still others, like the CAR T-cell therapy recently approved to treat some types of leukemia and lymphomas, require a patient’s immune cells to be removed from the body and genetically engineered to attack the tumor cells. Many of these approaches have been successful, but they each have downsides — from difficult-to-handle side effects to high-cost and lengthy preparation or treatment times.\n\n“All of these immunotherapy advances are changing medical practice,” Levy said. “Our approach uses a one-time application of very small amounts of two agents to stimulate the immune cells only within the tumor itself. In the mice, we saw amazing, bodywide effects, including the elimination of tumors all over the animal.”\n\nCancers often exist in a strange kind of limbo with regard to the immune system. Immune cells like T cells recognize the abnormal proteins often present on cancer cells and infiltrate to attack the tumor. However, as the tumor grows, it often devises ways to suppress the activity of the T cells.\n\nLevy’s method works to reactivate the cancer-specific T cells by injecting microgram amounts of two agents directly into the tumor site. (A microgram is one-millionth of a gram). One, a short stretch of DNA called a CpG oligonucleotide, works with other nearby immune cells to amplify the expression of an activating receptor called OX40 on the surface of the T cells. The other, an antibody that binds to OX40, activates the T cells to lead the charge against the cancer cells. Because the two agents are injected directly into the tumor, only T cells that have infiltrated it are activated. In effect, these T cells are “prescreened” by the body to recognize only cancer-specific proteins.\n\nCancer-destroying rangers\n\nSome of these tumor-specific, activated T cells then leave the original tumor to find and destroy other identical tumors throughout the body.\n\nThe approach worked startlingly well in laboratory mice with transplanted mouse lymphoma tumors in two sites on their bodies. Injecting one tumor site with the two agents caused the regression not just of the treated tumor, but also of the second, untreated tumor. In this way, 87 of 90 mice were cured of the cancer. Although the cancer recurred in three of the mice, the tumors again regressed after a second treatment. The researchers saw similar results in mice bearing breast, colon and melanoma tumors.\n\nI don’t think there’s a limit to the type of tumor we could potentially treat, as long as it has been infiltrated by the immune system.\n\nMice genetically engineered to spontaneously develop breast cancers in all 10 of their mammary pads also responded to the treatment. Treating the first tumor that arose often prevented the occurrence of future tumors and significantly increased the animals’ life span, the researchers found.\n\nFinally, Sagiv-Barfi explored the specificity of the T cells by transplanting two types of tumors into the mice. She transplanted the same lymphoma cancer cells in two locations, and she transplanted a colon cancer cell line in a third location. Treatment of one of the lymphoma sites caused the regression of both lymphoma tumors but did not affect the growth of the colon cancer cells.\n\n“This is a very targeted approach,” Levy said. “Only the tumor that shares the protein targets displayed by the treated site is affected. We’re attacking specific targets without having to identify exactly what proteins the T cells are recognizing.”\n\nThe current clinical trial is expected to recruit about 15 patients with low-grade lymphoma. If successful, Levy believes the treatment could be useful for many tumor types. He envisions a future in which clinicians inject the two agents into solid tumors in humans prior to surgical removal of the cancer as a way to prevent recurrence due to unidentified metastases or lingering cancer cells, or even to head off the development of future tumors that arise due to genetic mutations like BRCA1 and 2.\n\n“I don’t think there’s a limit to the type of tumor we could potentially treat, as long as it has been infiltrated by the immune system,” Levy said.\n\nThe work is an example of Stanford Medicine’s focus on precision health, the goal of which is to anticipate and prevent disease in the healthy and precisely diagnose and treat disease in the ill.\n\nThe study’s other Stanford co-authors are senior research assistant and lab manager Debra Czerwinski; professor of medicine Shoshana Levy, PhD; postdoctoral scholar Israt Alam, PhD; graduate student Aaron Mayer; and professor of radiology Sanjiv Gambhir, MD, PhD.\n\nLevy is a member of the Stanford Cancer Institute and Stanford Bio-X.\n\nGambhir is the founder and equity holder in CellSight Inc., which develops and translates multimodality strategies to image cell trafficking and transplantation.\n\nThe research was supported by the National Institutes of Health (grant CA188005), the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, the Boaz and Varda Dotan Foundation and the Phil N.

This includes operating through a web of shadowy front companies, or by using sub-contractors.\n\nIn one exchange, when asked about digging up material on political opponents, Mr Nix said they could “send some girls around to the candidate’s house”, adding that Ukrainian girls “are very beautiful, I find that works very well”.\n\nIn another he said: “We’ll offer a large amount of money to the candidate, to finance his campaign in exchange for land for instance, we’ll have the whole thing recorded, we’ll blank out the face of our guy and we post it on the Internet.”\n\nOffering bribes to public officials is an offence under both the UK Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Cambridge Analytica operates in the UK and is registered in the United States.\n\nThe admissions were filmed at a series of meetings at London hotels over four months, between November 2017 and January 2018.

He said Europe and the world are “watching us” and “waiting for us to defend the spirit of the Enlightenment, threatened in so many places”.\n\nHe promised to unite a divided and fractured France, saying: “I will do everything to make sure you never have reason again to vote for extremes.”\n\nSpeaking of his meteoric rise and victory that was not forecast even a year ago, he said: “Everyone said it was impossible. But they didn’t know France!”\n\nPlay Video 3:08 Who is the new French president, Emmanuel Macron? – video\n\nDespite the wide margin of the final result, Le Pen’s score nonetheless marked a historic high for the French far right. Even after a lacklustre campaign that ended with a calamitous performance in the final TV debate, she was projected to have taken almost 11m votes, double that of her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, when he reached the presidential run-off in 2002. The anti-immigration, anti-EU Front National’s supporters asserted that the party had a central place as an opposition force in France.\n\nTurnout was the lowest in more than 40 years. Almost one-third of voters chose neither Macron nor Le Pen, with 12 million abstaining and 4.2 million spoiling ballot papers.\n\nMacron, who has never held elected office and was unknown until three years ago, is France’s youngest president. Next Sunday, he will take over a country under a state of emergency, still facing a major terrorism threat and struggling with a stagnant economy after decades of mass unemployment. France is divided after an election campaign in which anti-establishment anger saw the traditional left and right ruling parties ejected from the race in the first round for the first time since the period after the second world war.\n\n\n\nFrançois Bayrou, an ex-minister and Macron’s centrist ally, said: “He is the youngest head of state on the planet [which] sends an incredible message of hope. Macron is giving hope to people who had no hope. Hope that maybe we can do something, go beyond the [left-right] divide that no longer makes sense.”\n\nLe Pen swiftly conceded defeat. She said she had won a “historic and massive” score that made her leader of “the biggest opposition force” in France and vowed to radically overhaul her Front National party. Her promise to “transform” the far-right movement left open the possibility that the party could be expanded and renamed in an attempt to boost its electoral chances. It was a major step in the political normalisation of her movement.\n\nThe outgoing Socialist president, François Hollande, who was once Macron’s mentor and had appointed him economy minister, said: “His large victory confirms that a very great majority of our citizens wanted to unite around the values of the Republic and show their attachment to the European Union and show France is open to the world.”\n\nOn Monday Hollande embraced his successor as the two men attended a ceremony at Paris’s Arc de Triomphe to commemorate victory over the Nazis in the second world war. Hollande walked beside Macron to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the monument, where they laid a wreath.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Macron and Hollande attend a ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris on Monday. Photograph: Philippe Wojazer/Reuters\n\nMacron’s victory came not only because voters supported his policy platform for free market, pro-business reform, and his promises to energise the EU, coupled with a leftwing approach to social issues. Some of his voters came from other parties across the political spectrum and turned out not in complete support of his programme but to stop the Front National.\n\nIn a political landscape with a strong hard left and far right, Macron faces the challenge of trying to win a parliamentary majority for his fledgling political movement En Marche! (On the Move!) in legislative elections next month. Without a majority, he will not be able to carry out his manifesto promises.\n\nAfter the Brexit vote and the election of Trump as US president, the race for the Élysée was the latest election to shake up establishment politics by kicking out the figures that stood for the status quo, ejecting the mainstream parties that have dominated French politics for 50 years and leaving the political novice Macron to do battle with the far right.\n\nHis victory comes after a bitter campaign with Le Pen in which she accused him of being part of an elite that did not understand ordinary people and he said Le Pen represented the “party of hatred” that wanted a “civil war” in France. The runoff pitted France’s most Europhile candidate against its most Europhobe.\n\n\n\nIn Brussels and Berlin, there was relief that Le Pen’s anti-EU, anti-globalisation programme was defeated.\n\nA spokesman for the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said it was a “victory for a strong and united Europe” while the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said French voters had chosen a “European future”.\n\nThe office of the British prime minister, Theresa May, said she “warmly congratulates” Macron on his victory and “we look forward to working with the new president on a wide range of shared priorities”.\n\nTrump, who will meet Macron on 25 May at the Nato summit in Brussels, tweeted: “Congratulations to Emmanuel Macron on his big win today as the next president of France. I look very much forward to working with him!” Earlier in the campaign, he had declared Le Pen the strongest candidate.\n\nIn a congratulatory statement, the Kremlin, which was widely seen as backing Le Pen, urged Macron to overcome mutual distrust and join forces to ensure international stability and security.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Supporters of Macron celebrating in Paris on Sunday night. Photograph: Jean-Paul Pelissier/Reuters\n\nHours before the end of campaigning on Friday night, Macron’s campaign was hacked, which Paris prosecutors are investigating. Hundreds of thousands of emails and documents were dumped online and spread by WikiLeaks in what his campaign called an attempt at “democratic destabilisation”.\n\n\n\nMacron, a former investment banker and senior civil servant who grew up in a bourgeois family in Amiens, served as deputy chief of staff to Hollande but was not part of the Socialist party.\n\nWhat is in Macron's in-tray as president? France’s youngest president takes over a country exhausted by years of unemployment and facing a constant terrorist threat. So what will his first moves be? First, Macron, who comes from no established political party, needs to appoint a prime minister and a cabinet, and win a parliamentary majority in next month’s election. Next, he will need to swiftly fulfil some of his manifesto promises: including streamlining France’s strict labour laws in favour of businesses, overhauling the ethics rules for politicians, and strengthening ties with Germany's Angela Merkel and the rest of the EU.\n\n\n\nIn 2014, Hollande appointed him economy minister but he left government in 2016, complaining that pro-business reforms were not going far enough. A year ago he formed En Marche!, promising to shake up France’s “vacuous” and discredited political class.\n\n\n\nMacron campaigned on pledges to ease labour laws, improve education in deprived areas and extend protections for self-employed people.\n\n\n\nThe election race was full of extraordinary twists and turns. Hollande became the first president since the war to decide not to run again for office after slumping to record unpopularity with a satisfaction rating of 4%.\n\nHis troubled five-year term left France still struggling with a sluggish economy and a mood of disillusionment with the political class. The country is more divided than ever before. More than 230 people have been killed in terrorist attacks in little more than two years, the political class is questioning Islam’s place in French society and more than three million people are unemployed.\n\n\n\nThe rightwing candidate, François Fillon, once seen as favourite, was badly damaged by a judicial investigation into a string of corruption allegations, including that he paid his wife and children generous salaries from public funds for fake parliamentary assistant jobs.\n\nThe Guardian view on the French election: Good luck, Mr Macron. You will need it | Editorial Read more\n\nThe ruling Socialist party, under its candidate Benoît Hamon, saw its score plunge to 6%, while the hard-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon finished fourth.\n\nThe final round marks a redrawing of the political landscape, away from the old left-right divide towards a contest between a liberal, pro-globalisation stance and “close the borders” nationalism.

Ahead of this, the group of founders of AI and robotics companies have sent an open letter to the UN calling for it to prevent the arms race that is currently under way for killer robots.\n\n\n\nIn their letter, the founders warn the review conference of the convention on conventional weapons that this arms race threatens to usher in the “third revolution in warfare” after gunpowder and nuclear arms.\n\nThe founders wrote: “Once developed, lethal autonomous weapons will permit armed conflict to be fought at a scale greater than ever, and at timescales faster than humans can comprehend. These can be weapons of terror, weapons that despots and terrorists use against innocent populations, and weapons hacked to behave in undesirable ways.\n\n“We do not have long to act. Once this Pandora’s box is opened, it will be hard to close.”\n\nExperts have previously warned that AI technology has reached a point where the deployment of autonomous weapons is feasible within years, rather than decades. While AI can be used to make the battlefield a safer place for military personnel, experts fear that offensive weapons that operate on their own would lower the threshold of going to battle and result in greater loss of human life.\n\nThe letter, launching at the opening of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) in Melbourne on Monday, has the backing of high-profile figures in the robotics field and strongly stresses the need for urgent action, after the UN was forced to delay a meeting that was due to start Monday to review the issue.\n\nThe founders call for “morally wrong” lethal autonomous weapons systems to be added to the list of weapons banned under the UN’s convention on certain conventional weapons (CCW) brought into force in 1983, which includes chemical and intentionally blinding laser weapons.\n\nToby Walsh, Scientia professor of artificial intelligence at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, said: “Nearly every technology can be used for good and bad, and artificial intelligence is no different. It can help tackle many of the pressing problems facing society today: inequality and poverty, the challenges posed by climate change and the ongoing global financial crisis.\n\n“However, the same technology can also be used in autonomous weapons to industrialise war. We need to make decisions today choosing which of these futures we want.”\n\nMusk, one of the signatories of the open letter, has repeatedly warned for the need for pro-active regulation of AI, calling it humanity’s biggest existential threat, but while AI’s destructive potential is considered by some to be vast it is also thought be distant.\n\nRyan Gariepy, the founder of Clearpath Robotics said: “Unlike other potential manifestations of AI which still remain in the realm of science fiction, autonomous weapons systems are on the cusp of development right now and have a very real potential to cause significant harm to innocent people along with global instability.”\n\nThis is not the first time the IJCAI, one of the world’s leading AI conferences, has been used as a platform to discuss lethal autonomous weapons systems. Two years ago the conference was used to launch an open letter signed by thousands of AI and robotics researchers including Musk and Stephen Hawking similarly calling for a ban, which helped push the UN into formal talks on the technologies.\n\nThe UK government opposed such a ban on lethal autonomous weapons in 2015, with the Foreign Office stating that “international humanitarian law already provides sufficient regulation for this area”. It said that the UK was not developing lethal autonomous weapons and that all weapons employed by UK armed forces would be “under human oversight and control”.\n\nScience fiction or science fact?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The T-800 from the Terminator film franchise.

Samsung’s SGR-A1 sentry gun, which is reportedly technically capable of firing autonomously but is disputed whether it is deployed as such, is in use along the South Korean border of the 2.5m-wide Korean Demilitarized Zone.\n\nThe fixed-place sentry gun, developed on behalf of the South Korean government, was the first of its kind with an autonomous system capable of performing surveillance, voice-recognition, tracking and firing with mounted machine gun or grenade launcher. But it is not the only autonomous weapon system in development, with prototypes available for land, air and sea combat.\n\nThe UK’s Taranis drone, in development by BAE Systems, is intended to be capable of carrying air-to-air and air-to-ground ordnance intercontinentally and incorporating full autonomy. The unmanned combat aerial vehicle, about the size of a BAE Hawk, the plane used by the Red Arrows, had its first test flight in 2013 and is expected to be operational some time after 2030 as part of the Royal Air Force’s Future Offensive Air System, destined to replace the human-piloted Tornado GR4 warplanes.\n\nRussia, the US and other countries are currently developing robotic tanks that can either be remote controlled or operate autonomously. These projects range from autonomous versions of the Russian Uran-9 unmanned combat ground vehicle, to conventional tanks retrofitted with autonomous systems.\n\nThe US’s autonomous warship, the Sea Hunter built by Vigor Industrial, was launched in 2016 and, while still in development, is intended to have offensive capabilities including anti-submarine ordnance.

The ban temporarily suspended the nation\'s refugee program and immigration from countries that have raised terrorism concerns.\n\nJustice Department lawyers appealed to the 9th Circuit, arguing that the president has the constitutional power to restrict entry to the United States and that the courts cannot second-guess his determination that such a step was needed to prevent terrorism.\n\nThe states said Trump\'s travel ban harmed individuals, businesses and universities. Citing Trump\'s campaign promise to stop Muslims from entering the U.S., they said the ban unconstitutionally blocked entry to people based on religion.\n\nBoth sides faced tough questioning during an hour of arguments Tuesday conducted by phone — an unusual step — and broadcast live on cable networks, newspaper websites and social media. It attracted a huge audience.\n\nThe judges hammered away at the administration\'s claim that the ban was motivated by terrorism fears, but they also challenged the states\' argument that it targeted Muslims.\n\n"I have trouble understanding why we\'re supposed to infer religious animus when, in fact, the vast majority of Muslims would not be affected," Judge Richard Clifton, a George W. Bush nominee, asked an attorney representing Washington state and Minnesota.\n\nOnly 15 percent of the world\'s Muslims are affected by the executive order, the judge said, citing his own calculations.\n\n"Has the government pointed to any evidence connecting these countries to terrorism?" Judge Michelle T. Friedland, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, asked the Justice Department attorney.\n\nThe lower-court judge temporarily halted the ban after determining that the states were likely to win the case and had shown that the ban would restrict travel by their residents, damage their public universities and reduce their tax base. Robart put the executive order on hold while the lawsuit works its way through the courts.\n\nAfter that ruling, the State Department quickly said people from the seven countries — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — with valid visas could travel to the U.S. The decision led to tearful reunions at airports round the country.\n\nDuring his remarks at a law enforcement conference, Trump said the courts blocking his divisive immigration order "seem to be so political."\n\nTrump\'s own Supreme Court pick, Neil Gorsuch, finds the president\'s comments about the judicial branch "disheartening" and "demoralizing," a spokeswoman for the nomination confirmation team told NBC News on Wednesday.\n\nThe Supreme Court has a vacancy, and there\'s no chance Gorsuch, will be confirmed in time to take part in any consideration of the ban.\n\nThe ban was set to expire in 90 days, meaning it could run its course before the court would take up the issue.

If this can be developed to an industrial scale, it opens the door to removing CO 2 from the atmosphere for long-term storage, thus countering the global warming effect of atmospheric CO 2 . This work is presented at the Goldschmidt conference in Boston.\n\nScientists are already working to slow global warming by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but there are serious practical and economic limits on developing the technology. Now, for the first time, researchers have explained how magnesite forms at low temperature, and offered a route to dramatically accelerating its crystallization. A tonne of naturally-occurring magnesite can remove around half a tonne of CO 2 from the atmosphere, but the rate of formation is very slow.\n\nProject leader, Professor Ian Power (Trent University, Ontario, Canada) said:\n\n"Our work shows two things. Firstly, we have explained how and how fast magnesite forms naturally. This is a process which takes hundreds to thousands of years in nature at Earth\'s surface. The second thing we have done is to demonstrate a pathway which speeds this process up dramatically"\n\nThe researchers were able to show that by using polystyrene microspheres as a catalyst, magnesite would form within 72 days. The microspheres themselves are unchanged by the production process, so they can ideally be reused.\n\n"Using microspheres means that we were able to speed up magnesite formation by orders of magnitude. This process takes place at room temperature, meaning that magnesite production is extremely energy efficient"\n\nMagnesite sediments in a playa in British Columbia, Canada. Credit: Ian Power\n\n"For now, we recognise that this is an experimental process, and will need to be scaled up before we can be sure that magnesite can be used in carbon sequestration (taking CO 2 from the atmosphere and permanently storing it as magnesite). This depends on several variables, including the price of carbon and the refinement of the sequestration technology, but we now know that the science makes it do-able".\n\nCommenting, Professor Peter Kelemen at Columbia University\'s Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory (New York) said "It is really exciting that this group has worked out the mechanism of natural magnesite crystallization at low temperatures, as has been previously observed—but not explained—in weathering of ultramafic rocks. The potential for accelerating the process is also important, potentially offering a benign and relatively inexpensive route to carbon storage, and perhaps even direct CO 2 removal from air."\n\nExplore further: Scientists probe abandoned mine for clues about permanent CO2 sequestration', 'title': 'Scientists find way to make mineral which can remove CO2 from atmosphere', 'url': 'https://phys.org/news/2018-08-scientists-mineral-co2-atmosphere.html', 'keywords': ['warming', 'scientists', 'atmosphere', 'sequestration', 'tonne', 'magnesite', 'mineral', 'way', 'carbon', 'work', 'co2', 'remove', 'microspheres', 'process', 'ian'], 'tags': {'carbon', 'global warming'}, 'summary': 'Credit: Ian Power Scientists have found a rapid way of producing magnesite, a mineral which stores carbon dioxide.\nScientists are already working to slow global warming by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but there are serious practical and economic limits on developing the technology.\nA tonne of naturally-occurring magnesite can remove around half a tonne of CO 2 from the atmosphere, but the rate of formation is very slow.\n"Using microspheres means that we were able to speed up magnesite formation by orders of magnitude.\nExplore further: Scientists probe abandoned mine for clues about permanent CO2 sequestration', 'date': None}, {'text': 'CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. and Mexican law enforcement authorities will set up a joint team based in Chicago targeting the leaders and finances of drug cartels that ship opioids into the United States, aiming to stanch a spike in overdose deaths, officials said on Wednesday.\n\nThe new effort comes amid strained ties between the neighbors and about four months before Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a left-leaning nationalist, is due to take power.\n\nLopez Obrador has vowed to shake up Mexico’s war on drug cartels and wants to rewrite the rules, aides have said, suggesting negotiated peace and amnesties rather than a hardline strategy critics blame for perpetuating violence.\n\nHe has also said he wants to reset relations with the United States, which have been rocky since Donald Trump became president.\n\n“We are sure the next president of the republic will be willing to collaborate in the fight against organized crime,” Felipe de Jesus Munoz Vazquez, Mexico’s deputy attorney general for the specialized investigation of federal crimes unit, told a joint U.S.-Mexican news conference in Chicago.\n\nLopez Obrador’s team offered no immediate comment, but his future security minister, Alfonso Durazo, has said all co-operation pacts between the neighbors will be reviewed.\n\nA spokeswoman of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration said the co-operation was the first of its kind since a Mexican delegation of this size had never before combined forces and traveled to the United States to publicly discuss ways to battle transnational criminal networks.\n\nSince the 1970s, the “DEA and the Government of Mexico have cooperated on combating the flow of illegal drugs through exchange of information and intelligence,” the spokeswoman, Cori Rizman, told Reuters in an email.\n\nThese efforts had aimed to disrupt and dismantle cartels affecting both sides of the border, she added.\n\nThey include the decade-old $2.9-billion Merida Initiative that directs aid from U.S. agencies to Mexico to fight organized crime and drug trafficking, Durazo said this month.\n\nLopez Obrador wants to refocus aid to social and economic projects, he added.\n\n“The sole purpose of these entities is one thing and one thing only - money,” said Anthony Williams, chief of operations for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, so that targeting cartel finances is crucial to stop the flow of drugs.\n\nMexico remains the principal highway for cocaine to the United States and has become the top source of heroin, which is fueling a surge in opioid addiction.

The bridge collapsed on Tuesday killing at least 39 people and severing the country’s A10 motorway.\n\nThe statement has since been deleted from the party’s website, but a cached version is still visible online. It was drawn up in opposition to the “Gronda di Genova”, a major infrastructure project to improve the motorways in the city region that included work on the now collapsed bridge.\n\nSome architects and engineers had warned that the bridge, built by Italian civil engineer Riccardo Morandi in the 1960s, suffered from fatal design flaws; reinforcement work was carried out on it in 2016 in an attempt to shore it up. A complete rebuild was not carried out to avoid disruption, however.\n\nThe statement on the M5S website accuses the regional president who backed the reinforcement work of not having read a public inquiry report into the state of the bridge, and says the party “asks ourselves what credibility those who support the great works can still have”.\n\nItalian bridge collapses: part of highway gives

the subject of protests and which has been put under review by the incoming transport ministry and similarly described as a waste of money.\n\nImprovements to the bridge were also included by the M5S on a list of infrastructure projects which could be scrapped subject to a review of the costs and benefits.\n\nBridges designed by the late civil engineer Mr Morandi tend to be unusual because the planner used reinforced concrete instead of steel cables for the stays of the bridge, and used relatively few cables compared to most other designs.\n\nAs of Wednesday around 250 firefighters from around Italy were still searching through the rubble of the bridge for survivors, with concern that the death toll could still rise further.\n\n“We’re not giving up hope,” fire official Emanuele Giffi told the AFP news agency, vowing to work “around the clock until the last victim is secured”.\n\nThe country’s M5S deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, appeared to suggest contractors could be to blame.\n\n“Those responsible for the tragedy in Genoa have a name and a surname, and they’re called Autostrade per l’Italia. For years it’s been said that private management would be better than that of the state,” he said on social media on Wednesday.\n\n“And so today, we have one of the biggest dealers in Europe telling us that the bridge was safe and there was no worry of it collapsing. Autostrade had to maintain it but didn’t. It takes the highest road tolls in Europe and pays low taxes, moreover in Luxembourg.”\n\nThere has also been speculation about whether the 2016 work was carried out properly, with the widespread suspicion in Italy that some public infrastructure jobs could be compromised by organised crime involvement – though there is currently no evidence that this was the case for the bridge work.\n\nThe regional government of Liguria, in which the disaster took place, submitted a request to the national government for the ability to declare a 12-month state of emergency.

He later disclosed that it was GCap Holdings, located in a Brooklyn neighborhood with a booming Russian population, and GCap also confirmed it had retained Gelbinovich “to explore potential lobbying initiatives” on behalf of unnamed clients based in Russia.\n\nGelbinovich’s activities form another strand of the web of connections between Trump World and wealthy Russians.\n\nAnd that web is already thick: Besides President Trump’s much-vaunted personal friendliness with Russian President Vladimir Putin himself, Trump and his allies have a long history of doing business with Russian power players.\n\nHis commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, invested in a shipping firm linked to Putin’s judo partner, who is under U.S. sanctions, according to The New York Times. Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, received a six-figure payment from a firm with ties to sanctioned Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg; and Trump himself teamed up with oligarch Aras Agalarov to put on the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow in 2013.\n\nThe revelation about Gelbinovich also comes as a jury begins deliberations on the fate of another Trump campaign alum, Paul Manafort—who faces criminal charges related to his work for a Putin ally in Ukraine.\n\nEvelyn Farkas, an Atlantic Council senior fellow, said the Gelbinovich effort highlights the growing consternation in Moscow about U.S. sanctions.\n\n“That just tells you how much nervousness there is in Russia about being put on the sanctions list,” said Farkas, who worked on Russia matters at the Pentagon during the Obama administration.\n\nGelbinovich was a low-level staffer on the Trump campaign, according to campaign sources, frequently booking travel for senior staff. He was on the campaign in its very early days. A picture published by the Daily Mail on Aug. 27, 2015, shows him sitting alone at a long, bare table in Trump campaign headquarters, cradling a phone and flanked by “Trump Make America Great Again!” signs.\n\nAfter the campaign, he did a stint at the lobbying firm Williams & Jensen, according to a public lobbying disclosure filing, working for Coca-Cola. Gelbinovich told The Daily Beast he is now self-employed and consulting and that his work for GCap had nothing to do with Williams & Jensen.\n\nWhen the Daily Beast first asked Gelbinovich about outreach, he said in a written statement that he understood he was approaching lobbyists on behalf Roman Abramovich, one of Russia’s wealthiest men.\n\n“The firm claimed that this outreach was on behalf of the individual you mentioned,” Gelbinovich said in an email. “I do not have a direct connection to Mr. Abramovich myself.”\n\nThe lobbyists who spoke to the Daily Beast said Gelbinovich also told them he was looking for someone to help Abramovich in the sanctions arena.\n\nBut two days after the initial publication of this article, Gelbinovich backtracked and said his statement was inaccurate and “probably should have been clearer that Abramovich was NOT a client (but rather was among a group of well-known Russians that they might later seek to target for work).’’\n\nGCap also said it was not doing any work for Abramovich, noting that it “retained Mr. Gelbinovich to explore potential lobbying initiatives on behalf of completely different Russia-based clients.”\n\n“At no point was my firm or Mr. Gelbinovich ever retained to undertake any work on behalf of Mr. Abramovich, his representatives, or any of his business interests. Nor did we ever communicate to lobbyists that we represent Mr. Abramovich in any respect,” GCap’s CEO said in an email.\n\nJohn Mann, a spokesperson for Abramovich, said the oligarch did not sign off on any outreach to D.C. lobbyists.\n\n“At no time has Mr. Abramovich, or anyone authorized to act on his behalf, engaged any individual or company to lobby on his behalf in the United States,” he said in an email to The Daily Beast. “We have instructed our attorneys to draft a cease-and-desist letter regarding the representations reportedly made by Mr. Gelbinovich, whom we had never heard of before today.”\n\nAbramovich has faced legal challenges this past year. The BBC reported in June that he withdrew his application for a visa to the U.K. after his investor visa expired in May. The BBC pointed to exacerbated diplomatic tensions between the U.K. and Russia over the chemical weapon attack on retired Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia as a possible explanation for Abramovich’s visa troubles. Abramovich then took up Israeli citizenship, according to the Guardian.\n\nSome Russia’s wealthiest people have been iced out of the American financial system under the Trump administration as the Treasury Department has implemented sanctions retaliating against the Kremlin for meddling in the 2016 presidential election. In April of this year, Treasury announced a new round of sanctions targeting Russian entities and oligarchs, including Oleg Deripaska, the Putin ally who put millions into the pocket of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\n\nPushing back against economic sanctions has been a key focus of Russian foreign policy for years. When Kremlin-linked Russians met with Trump campaign bosses at Trump Tower in June 2016, participants claimed the group just discussed adoptions—likely Putin’s decision to bar Americans from adopting Russian children, a move retaliating against American sanctions.\n\nAnd when alleged Russian operative Maria Butina questioned then-candidate Trump on July 22, 2015, she asked him about sanctions.\n\n“I know Putin, and I’ll tell you what, we’ll get along with Putin,” Trump told her. “I would get along very nicely with Putin, I mean, where we have the strength. I don’t think you’d need the sanctions. I think we would get along very, very well.”\n\nThe sanctions list hasn’t just survived the Trump administration; it’s grown. And it’s generated plenty of potential leads for Trump allies like Gelbinovich looking to cash in on their influence in Washington.\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect a statement from GCap Holdings, which denies that it represents Abramovich, and a revised statement from Gelbinovich in which he says his earlier confirmation that Abramovich is a current GCap client was incorrect.',

25 per cent went to GP gap payments.\n\nA further 12 per cent was spent on diagnostic imaging services, like radiology.\n\nThe out-of-pocket costs also varied depending on postcode, and the nation\'s

in the 2017-18 financial year the Medicare bulk-billing rate hit a record high of 86 per cent, with more than 133 million free GP services delivered.\n\n"Medicare funding is at record levels and the comprehensive data released today shows more Australians are seeing their doctor without having to pay than ever before," Mr Hunt said.\n\nHowever, Dr Bartone said those paying the gap fee were still

{'text': 'The National Security Agency\n\nsuccessfully broke the encryption on a number of “high potential” virtual private networks, including those of media organization Al Jazeera, the Iraqi military and internet service organizations, and a number of airline reservation systems, according to a March 2006 NSA document\n\nA virtual private network, or VPN, uses an encrypted connection to enable users to go over the internet and connect to a private network, such as a corporate intranet. This allows an organization’s staff to access internal services like file-sharing servers or private wikis without having to physically be in the office.\n\nThe NSA’s ability to crack into sensitive VPNs belonging to large organizations, all the way back in 2006, raises broader questions about the security of such networks. Many consumers pay for access to VPNs in order to mask the origin of their internet traffic from the sites they visit, hide their surfing habits from their internet service providers, and to protect against eavesdroppers on public Wi-Fi networks.\n\nThe fact that the NSA spied on Al Jazeera’s communications was reported by the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel in 2013, but that reporting did not mention that the spying was accomplished through the NSA’s compromise of Al Jazeera’s VPN. During the Bush administration, high-ranking U.S. officials criticized Al Jazeera, accusing the Qatar-based news organization of having an anti-American bias, including because it broadcasted taped messages from Osama bin Laden.\n\n“Both protocols offer a zillion configurable options, which is a source of a lot of the vulnerabilities.”\n\nAt the time, Al Jazeera defended itself against this criticism, insisting that its reporting was objective. “Osama bin Laden, like it or not, is a party to this present crisis,” news editor Ahmed Al Sheikh told the BBC in 2001. “If we said that we were not going to allow him the air time, then we would have lost our integrity and objectivity and our coverage of the story would have become unbalanced.”\n\nAccording to the document, contained in the cache of materials provided by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, the NSA also compromised VPNs used by airline reservation systems Iran Air, “Paraguayan SABRE,” Russian airline Aeroflot, and “Russian Galileo.” Sabre and Galileo are both privately operated, centralized computer systems that facilitate travel transactions like booking airline tickets. Collectively, they are used by hundreds of airlines around the world.\n\nIn Iraq, the NSA compromised VPNs at the Ministries of Defense and the Interior; the Ministry of Defense had been established by the U.S. in 2004 after the prior iteration was dissolved. Exploitation against the ministries’ VPNs appears to have occurred at roughly the same time as a broader “all-out campaign to penetrate Iraqi networks,” described by an NSA staffer in 2005.\n\n“Although VPNs pose special challenges for SIGINT (signals intelligence) collection and processing, we’ve recently had notable success in exploiting these communications,” wrote the author of the document, an article for the internal NSA news site SIDtoday. The author added that the NSA’s Network Analysis Center had been focusing on “VPN SIGINT Development (SIGDev) for over three years now, and the investment is paying off!” The article does not say what VPN technology any of the targets used, nor does it give any technical details on how the NSA broke the encryption on them.\n\nThe technical details that describe how the NSA exploits VPNs are a closely-guarded secret, according to another SIDtoday article, from December 2006. “Exploiting VPNs makes use of some of the newest state-of-the-art techniques,” the article stated, “and because of this, the exploitation details are held closely and generally not available to field sites.” The author went on to describe a tool called VIVIDDREAM that lets analysts who discover new VPNs test whether the NSA has the capability to exploit it, all without revealing to the analyst any sensitive information about how the exploit works.\n\nDocuments provided to news organizations by Snowden do not conclusively list which VPN technologies have been compromised by the NSA and which have not. However, there have been a number of news reports about the NSA’s VPN hacking capabilities based on these documents, and cryptographers who have reviewed them have come up with some educated guesses.\n\nIn 2014, The Intercept reported on the NSA’s plans, dated August 2009, to use an automated system called TURBINE to covertly infect millions of computers with malware. The revelations described a piece of NSA malware called HAMMERSTEIN, installed on routers that VPN traffic traverses. The malware was able to forward VPN traffic that uses the IPSec protocol back to the NSA to decrypt. However, the documents did not explain precisely how the decryption occurred.\n\nLater that year, Der Spiegel published 17 documents from the Snowden archive related to the NSA’s attacks against VPNs, many of them providing more details about TURBINE, HAMMERSTEIN, and related programs.\n\nThere are many different VPN protocols in use, some of them known to be less secure than others, and each can be configured in ways to make them more or less secure. One, Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol, “is old and insecure and there are a bunch of known security vulnerabilities since forever,” Nadia Heninger, cryptography researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, told me in an email. “I would not at all be shocked if these were being exploited in the wild.”\n\nThe NSA also appears to have, at least in some situations, broken the security of another VPN protocol, Internet Protocol Security, or IPSec, according to the Snowden documents published by The Intercept and Der Spiegel in 2014.\n\n“For both TLS and IPsec, there are both secure and insecure ways of configuring these protocols, so they can’t really be labeled as blanket ‘secure’ or ‘insecure,’” Heninger explained. “Both protocols offer a zillion configurable options, which is a source of a lot of the published protocol-level vulnerabilities, and there are cipher suites and parameter choices for both protocols that are definitely known to be cryptographically vulnerable.” Still, she was “pretty confident” that there are ways to configure TLS and IPsec that “should resist all known attacks.”', 'title': 'NSA Cracked Open Encrypted Networks of Russian Airlines, Al Jazeera, and Other “High Potential” Targets', 'url': 'https://theintercept.com/2018/08/15/nsa-vpn-hack-al-jazeera-sidtoday/', 'keywords': ['encrypted', 'russian', 'vpns', 'jazeera', 'high', 'nsas', 'nsa', 'targets', 'networks', 'potential', 'al', 'secure', 'security', 'internet', 'open', 'snowden', 'protocols', 'cracked', 'vpn'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'The technical details that describe how the NSA exploits VPNs are a closely-guarded secret, according to another SIDtoday article, from December 2006.\nDocuments provided to news organizations by Snowden do not conclusively list which VPN technologies have been compromised by the NSA and which have not.\nHowever, there have been a number of news reports about the NSA’s VPN hacking capabilities based on these documents, and cryptographers who have reviewed them have come up with some educated guesses.\nThe revelations described a piece of NSA malware called HAMMERSTEIN, installed on routers that VPN traffic traverses.\nThe malware was able to forward VPN traffic that uses the IPSec protocol back to the NSA to decrypt.', 'date': 1534291200}, {'text': "An enormous shipment of waste that was illegally shipped to Poland from the UK disguised as plastic is being sent back to where it came from.\n\nThe UK Environment Agency (EA) has confirmed they are working with Polish authorities to return the 1,000 tons of boxes, tins, detergent packaging and engine oil to British shores.\n\nA criminal investigation has been launched into three firms after the illegal waste marked as plastic recycling was intercepted at the Polish port of Gdynia.\n\nWaste and recycling trade body the Environmental Services Association (ESA) warned firms and councils to watch out for waste crime.\n\n“If it’s correct as alleged in the press about the involvement of organised criminals then that is very serious indeed and local authorities and businesses need to be vigilant and make sure they understand their duty of care requirements,” Jakob Rindegren, recycling policy adviser for the ESA, told Unearthed, Greenpeace’s investigative journalism platform.\n\nThe news comes amid concerns raised by the National Audit Office that “recycled” packaging material sent overseas could really be dumped or sent to landfill due to inadequate controls to prevent mismanagement.\n\nPreviously EA head Sir James Bevan has warned waste crime is the “new narcotics”, costing the country £1bn a year, as authorities have not yet woken up to the scale of the problem.\n\nSince China decided to ban imports of “foreign garbage”, the UK has had to desperately seek alternative destinations for the massive quantities of waste it currently exports.\n\nWays to reduce your single-use plastic 6 show all Ways to reduce your single-use plastic 1/6 Plastic water bottle for a reusable beverage container Instead of continually buying drinks in plastic bottles you can switch to a reusable beverage container and reduce your single-use of plastics.

In general, voters will be asked some version of the question, “do you believe that marijuana should be legalized and regulated like alcohol?” In other counties, the questions concern medical cannabis legalization.\n\nTuesday was the deadline for county clerks to approve advisory referendums, with Racine County approving a last-minute trio of cannabis questions for its ballot.\n\nIn addition to the more than dozen counties chiming in this November, at least two cities will pose similar legalization questions to voters.\n\nAccording to Cannabadger, an online news site that’s been tracking marijuana referendums in Wisconsin, just under half of Wisconsin’s population lives in the counties that have approved cannabis advisory questions.\n\nBREAKING: Racine County Board approves cannabis advisory referendum by 11-10 margin – Fifteen counties with 2.8 million residents will vote Nov. 6 on cannabis in Wisconsin!

Responses to those referendums showed strong support for reform—and just two years later, the state approved an adult-use legalization initiative.\n\nWisconsin appears to be heading down a similar path.\n\nOf the 20 counties where legalization referendums have been considered, only five county boards have rejected the bids, generally by slim margins.\n\nHere’s the full list of confirmed county cannabis questions:\n\nBrown County: Should cannabis be legalized in Wisconsin for medicinal purposes, and regulated in the same manner as other prescription drugs?\n\nClark County: Should the State of Wisconsin legalize the use of marijuana for medical purposes and regulate its use in the same manner as other prescription drugs?\n\nDane County: Should marijuana be legalized, taxed and regulated in the same manner as alcohol for adults 21 years of age or older?\n\nEau Claire County: Should cannabis:\n\n(a) Be legal for adult, 21years of age and older, recreational or medical use, taxed and regulated like alcohol, with the proceeds from the taxes used for education, healthcare, and infrastructure in Wisconsin?\n\n(b) Be legal for medical purposes only and available only by prescription through a medical dispensary?\n\n(c) Remain a criminally illegal drug as provided under current law?\n\nForest County: Should the State of Wisconsin allow individuals with debilitating medical conditions to use and safely access marijuana for medical purposes, if those individuals have a written recommendation from a licensed Wisconsin physician?\n\nKenosha County: Should the State of Wisconsin allow individuals with debilitating medical conditions to use and safely access marijuana for medical purposes, if those individuals have a written recommendation from a licensed Wisconsin physician?\n\nLa Crosse County: Should the State of Wisconsin legalize the use of marijuana by adults 21 years or older, to be taxed and regulated in the same manner that alcohol is regulated in the State of Wisconsin, with proceeds from taxes used for education, healthcare, and infrastructure?\n\nLanglade County: Should the State of Wisconsin allow individuals with debilitating medical conditions to use and safely access marijuana for medical purposes, if those individuals have a written recommendation from a licensed Wisconsin physician?\n\nMarathon County: Should the State of Wisconsin allow individuals with debilitating medical conditions to use and safely access marijuana for medical purposes, if those individuals have a written recommendation from a licensed Wisconsin physician?\n\nMarquette County: Resolved, that “We the People” of Marquette County, Wisconsin support the right of its citizens to acquire, possess and use medical cannabis upon the recommendation of a licensed physician, and;\n\nBe It Further Resolved, that we strongly support a statewide referendum Wisconsin to join the thirty-two (32) states that have already approved the use of medical cannabis for the treatment of chronic pain, several debilitating diseases and disabling symptoms.\n\nMilwaukee County: Do you favor allowing adults 21 years of age and older to engage in the personal use of marijuana, while also regulating commercial marijuana-related activities, and imposing a tax on the sale of marijuana?\n\nPortage County: Should the State of Wisconsin allow individuals with debilitating medical conditions to use and safely access marijuana for medical [treatment] purposes, if those individuals have a written [treatment] recommendation from a licensed Wisconsin physician?\n\nRacine County: Question No. 1: “Should marijuana be legalized for medicinal use?\n\nQuestion No. 2: Should marijuana be legalized, taxed, and regulated in the same manner as alcohol for adults 21 years of age or older?\n\nQuestion No. 3: Should proceeds from marijuana taxes be used to fund education, health care, and infrastructure?”\n\nRock County: Should cannabis be legalized for adult use, taxed and regulated like alcohol, with the proceeds from the Taxes used for education, healthcare, and infrastructure?\n\nSauk County: Should the state of Wisconsin legalize medical marijuana so that people with debilitating medical conditions may access medical marijuana if they have a prescription from a licenses Wisconsin physician?\n\nAdditionally, these cities will vote on marijuana advisory questions:\n\nRacine: Should cannabis be legalized for adult recreational use in Wisconsin?\n\nShould cannabis be legalized for medical use in Wisconsin?\n\nShould cannabis sales be taxed and the revenue from such taxes be used for public education, health care, and infrastructure in Wisconsin?\n\nShould cannabis be decriminalize in the State of Wisconsin?\n\nWaukesha: Should cannabis be legalized in Wisconsin for medicinal purposes, and regulated in the same manner as other prescription drugs\n\n“Just witnessing the huge turnouts and powerful testimony at the county board hearings around the state has increased the respect that cannabis reform is getting from the media and politicians around the state,” Eric Marsch, executive director of Southeastern Wisconsin NORML, told Marijuana Moment.\n\n“Wisconsin’s constitution doesn’t allow for binding referendums, so we’ll have to legalize through the legislature. If the legislature gets elected with a majority vote in favor of legalization, that will put a lot more pressure on them.”\n\nIt’s not clear how residents will vote at the county and city levels in November, but a recent poll from Marquette University Law School found that 61 percent of Wisconsinites favor full cannabis legalization over prohibition. Just 36 percent of respondents said they opposed legalization.\n\nMarsch said such polling is helpful but, because it’s based on a random sample of voters, “it’s easy for the politicians to dismiss the results as simply being heavily weighted in the more liberal parts of the state.”\n\n“By having an exact count of where voters in each district stand on the issue, it will be a lot easier to hold the legislators accountable.”\n\nAs it currently stands, Wisconsin has some of the most restrictive marijuana laws on the books. Simple possession of small amounts of cannabis can still land you in jail for up to six months.\n\nMeanwhile, voters in Michigan and North Dakota will consider binding statewide ballot initiatives to legalize marijuana this November, while Missouri and Utah will vote on allowing medical cannabis.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Philip Steffan.', 'title': 'UN Launches First-Ever Full Review Of Marijuana’s Status Under International Law', 'url': 'https://www.marijuanamoment.net/un-launches-first-ever-full-review-of-marijuanas-status-under-international-law/', 'keywords': ['wisconsin', 'state', 'review', 'launches', 'firstever', 'medical', 'regulated', 'individuals', 'status', 'cannabis', 'county', 'legalized', 'law', 'marijuanas', 'international', 'purposes', 'marijuana'], 'tags': {'featured'}, 'summary': 'BREAKING: Racine County Board approves cannabis advisory referendum by 11-10 margin – Fifteen counties with 2.8 million residents will vote Nov. 6 on cannabis in Wisconsin!\nHere’s the full list of confirmed county cannabis questions:Brown County: Should cannabis be legalized in Wisconsin for medicinal purposes, and regulated in the same manner as other prescription drugs?\n(b) Be legal for medical purposes only and available only by prescription through a medical dispensary?\nSauk County: Should the state of Wisconsin legalize medical marijuana so that people with debilitating medical conditions may access medical marijuana if they have a prescription from a licenses Wisconsin physician?\nMeanwhile, voters in Michigan and North Dakota will consider binding statewide ballot initiatives to legalize marijuana this November, while Missouri and Utah will vote on allowing medical cannabis.', 'date': 1534165910}, {'text': 'A church approved to deliver scripture lessons in NSW schools has been forced to remove material, which teaches children homosexuality is a sin and sinners deserve death, from its website by the NSW Department of Education, after questions were raised by the Herald.\n\nTwo other approved scripture providers either do not have a working website or do not have the curriculum they use in government primary and high schools available on their websites as required, and were contacted by the department on Wednesday.\n\nThe controversial material includes passages that state: "Homosexuality (and every other kind of sexual sin) is flourishing in our day."

Russian central-bank head Elvira Nabiullina said the sales were just part of “diversifying the entire structure of currencies.” But with the U.S. dollar accounting for two-thirds of global foreign-exchange reserves and most (non-intra-eurozone) international trade, dumping this much dollar debt goes well beyond prudent diversification.\n\nMany commentators have therefore speculated that the government was actually protecting itself against future U.S. economic attacks. “It looks like Russia was worried about sanctions and their ability to trade Treasuries,” said one head bond trader , “so they sold.”\n\nStill, the Russian central bank needs dollars, which it has always held mainly in the form highly liquid interest-bearing U.S. Treasuries, to stabilize the ruble through market intervention and to help its banks manage liquidity. Furthermore, Russian president Vladimir Putin has stated that “Russia is not rejecting the dollar” and is “not planning any sudden moves.” This doesn’t jibe with the media headlines.\n\nWe therefore decided to explore another possibility: that the headlines are just plain wrong, and that Russia has not sold anywhere near that many Treasuries.\n\nLet us start with U.S. Treasury Department data on holdings of Treasury securities. These do indeed show an $81 billion (84 percent) plunge in Russian-held Treasury debt—from $96 billion in March to $15 billion in May. Other figures, however, suggest that Russia’s actual selloff was much smaller than this.\n\nOne indicator is Treasury Department data that track sales, between U.S. and foreign entities, of long-term Treasuries—the sole component of Russia’s Treasury holdings that has dropped since March. From March to May, these data show just $35 billion of Russian sales, as the middle bar in the left-hand box above indicates.\n\nThis figure, however, likely underestimates Russia’s sales somewhat. Russia may have sold some Treasuries to non-U.S. parties, or executed some sales through foreign financial intermediaries, that the data do not capture. Still, by this measure, roughly $46 billion in Treasuries remain unaccounted for.\n\nRussian data show a similar amount missing. Russia’s central bank reports that, between March and May, its total stock of foreign debt fell by $50 billion. Since March, however, dollar appreciation has lowered the dollar value of Russia’s non-dollar debt assets. We estimate that this explains about $7 billion of the decline, implying $43 billion in actual Treasury sales—as the rightmost bar above shows. This is $8 billion more than the U.S. data indicate, which likely reflects about $8 billion in Russian sales to non-U.S. entities, or sales made through foreign intermediaries.\n\nThis leaves $38 billion in “missing” Treasuries. Where could they have gone? The most logical explanation is that Russia moved these assets outside of the United States to protect against U.S. seizure.\n\nThe two most likely destinations would be Belgium, home to custodian bank Euroclear, and the Cayman Islands. So we looked at data from both.\n\nSure enough, during April and May, as shown in the right-hand figures, Belgian holdings of Treasuries rose $25 billion, while Cayman Islands holdings rose $20 billion. That sum, $45 billion, is more than enough to account for the missing $38 billion.\n\nIn short, Russia appears to have sold only about 45 percent of its Treasury holdings—substantial, but far less than the 84 percent the media is reporting. Sixteen percent remain registered as Russian holdings in the United States, and the remaining 39 percent, we believe, are being hidden in Belgium and the Cayman Islands. With U.S.-Russia tensions increasing, we would not be surprised by further such “offshoring” of Russian Treasuries in the coming months.\n\nDen Originalartikel gibt es auf Council on Foreign Relations.

Once again, he expressed "deep remorse" for the war.\n\nIt was in keeping with what by all appearances has become a mission for Akihito over his 30-year reign: to make amends for a war fought in the name of his father, Hirohito. The 84-year-old monarch is set to abdicate next spring.\n\n"Reflecting on our past and bearing in mind the feelings of deep remorse, I earnestly hope that the ravages of war will never be repeated," Akihito said in a two-minute speech on the 73rd anniversary of Japan\'s surrender.\n\nAs emperor, he has made unprecedented visits to the Philippines and other Pacific islands conquered by Japan early in World War II and devastated in fierce fighting as the U.S.-led allies took them back. Though Akihito has avoided a direct apology, he has subtly stepped up his expressions of regret in recent years in carefully scripted statements on the war.\n\nHis words have taken on greater importance as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has sought to move Japan beyond its troubled past since coming to power in December 2012. Opponents of Abe\'s policies have grabbed onto the emperor\'s statements as a counterbalance to the prime minister\'s push to revise Japan\'s war-renouncing constitution and build up its military.\n\nAkihito\'s World War II-related trips and pronouncements form part of a broader effort to bring the royal family closer to the public. In so doing, he has won over pacifists, leftists and other critics of the emperor system in a way his father was never able to do.\n\nHirohito, who was worshipped as a living god until the end of the war, remains a controversial figure even today, with historians still debating his responsibility for the war.\n\nDuring his father\'s reign, Akihito himself was almost hit by a Molotov cocktail on a 1975 visit to Japan\'s southern Okinawa island, where tens of thousands of civilians died in intense fighting near the end of World War II.\n\nHe has since visited the island 10 times. Okinawans warmly welcomed him and his wife Michiko earlier this year in what was likely his last as emperor.\n\nAkihito was 11 years old when he heard his father\'s voice announcing Japan\'s surrender on the radio on Aug. 15, 1945. During the subsequent U.S. occupation of Japan, he was tutored in English by Elizabeth Vining, a Quaker, an experience that experts say gave Akihito his pacifist and democratic outlook.\n\nThough Hirohito hardly changed the wording of his Aug. 15 message for a quarter century, Akihito\'s has evolved since he became emperor after his father\'s death in 1989.\n\nOn the 50th anniversary of the war\'s end in 1995, he expressed for the first time the hope that the same tragedy would never be repeated.\n\nThe same year, then-Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama acknowledged Japan\'s wartime aggression and made a landmark apology to victims in the rest of Asia.\n\nHis successors expressed remorse to other Asian countries until Abe dropped them and any reference to aggression in his Aug. 15 remarks beginning in 2013. He has pledged that Japan will not repeat the devastation of war, and did again Wednesday.\n\nAbe also sent a religious offering to a Tokyo shrine that honors the war dead, including convicted war criminals. He has avoided visiting the shrine since 2013 in a bid to avoid overly angering China and South Korea, which see the Yasukuni shrine as a symbol of Japan\'s military aggression.\n\nIn his 70th anniversary address in 2015, Akihito started using the expression he used Wednesday, stronger words than he had used previously.\n\n"Reflecting on our past and bearing in mind the feelings of deep remorse over the last war, I earnestly hope that the ravages of war will never be repeated." - Emperor Akihito in 2015\n\nThe contrast with Abe captured media attention, with the prime minister portrayed as a nationalist pushing for a stronger military versus a pacifist Akihito. Abe wants Japan to stop dwelling on the past, while the emperor doesn\'t want his country to forget it.\n\nAkihito visited China early in his reign and has traveled to some of the harshest World War II battlefields in the Pacific. His 2005 visit to the U.S. territory of Saipan was hailed as a statement of his desire to be part of the postwar healing process. Akihito traveled to the western Pacific nation of Palau in 2015 and the Philippines in 2016.\n\nWhile his Aug. 15 address is always short, Akihito has expressed his thoughts about the war more clearly in annual birthday remarks and on overseas trips. He has repeatedly stressed the importance of studying history and passing it down to the next generations.\n\n"Now that the memories of the war have started to fade, I think it is extremely important for everyone to study time and again the course of history Japan has followed and to reflect on peace," he said in his 2011 birthday address.\n\nHis son, Crown Prince Naruhito, has largely echoed his father\'s pacifist stance, but it is unclear if the first postwar-generation emperor will be able to strike a similar chord with today\'s younger Japanese.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show Akihito visited Saipan in 2005.\n\n___\n\nFollow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi\n\nFind her work at https://www.apnews.com/search/mari%20yamaguchi', 'title': "Japanese emperor tries to make amends for his father's war", 'url': "https://apnews.com/c0f96c2519ab4bc3bbb0edbf47a6a52c/Japanese-emperor-tries-to-make-amends-for-his-father's-war", 'keywords': ['emperor', 'remorse', 'fathers', 'war', 'tries', 'japan', 'expressed', 'japans', 'past', 'akihito', 'amends', 'world', 'japanese'], 'tags': {'Akihito', 'International News', 'Japan', 'Asia Pacific', 'World War II'}, 'summary': "TOKYO (AP) — For his last time, Japan's Emperor Akihito addressed a memorial service Wednesday marking the end of World War II.\nAkihito's World War II-related trips and pronouncements form part of a broader effort to bring the royal family closer to the public.\nAbe also sent a religious offering to a Tokyo shrine that honors the war dead, including convicted war criminals.\n- Emperor Akihito in 2015The contrast with Abe captured media attention, with the prime minister portrayed as a nationalist pushing for a stronger military versus a pacifist Akihito.\nAkihito visited China early in his reign and has traveled to some of the harshest World War II battlefields in the Pacific.", 'date': None}, {'text': "The world is likely to see more extreme temperatures in the coming four years as natural warming reinforces manmade climate change, according to a new global forecasting system.\n\nFollowing a summer of heatwaves and forest fires in the northern hemisphere, the study in the journal Nature Communications suggests there will be little respite for the planet until at least 2022, and possibly not even then.\n\n\n\nFrom greenhouse to hothouse: the language of climate change Read more\n\nRising greenhouse gas emissions are steadily adding to the upward pressure on temperatures, but humans do not feel the change as a straight line because the effects are diminished or amplified by phases of natural variation.\n\n\n\nFrom 1998 to 2010, global temperatures were in a “hiatus” as natural cooling (from ocean circulation and weather systems) offset anthropogenic global warming. But the planet has now entered almost the opposite phase, when natural trends are boosting man-made effects.\n\n\n\n“Everything seems to be adding up,” said the author of the paper, Florian Sévellec of the French National Centre for Scientific Research. “There is a high possibility that we will be at the peak of a warm phase for the next couple of years.”\n\nThe scientist built his forecasting system by statistical “hind-casting”. This crunches the data from previous climate models to measure which combination was most effective in predicting past temperature trends.\n\n\n\nDomino-effect of climate events could move Earth into a ‘hothouse’ state Read more\n\nBased on this analysis, Sévellec says the statistical upward nudge from natural variation this year is twice as great of that of long-term global warming. Next year, it is likely to be three times higher.\n\nHe cautions that this should not be seen as a prediction that Europe will definitely have more heatwaves, the US more forest fires, South Africa more drought or the Arctic more ice melt. The likelihood of these events will increase, but his model is on a broad global scale. It does not predict which part of the world will experience warming or in which season.\n\n\n\nBut his data clearly suggests that water in the oceans will warm faster than air above land, which could raise the risks of floods, hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones.\n\n\n\n“Natural variability is a wriggle around the freight train that is global warming,” he says. “On a human scale, it is what we feel. What we don’t always feel is global warming. As a scientist, this is frightening because we don’t consider it enough. All we can do it give people information and let them make up their own mind.”\n\n\n\nHe said his model should not be seen as the final word, but be taken alongside other forecasting systems, including those that look in more detail at what is happening on a regional level.\n\n\n\nLast year was warmest ever that didn't feature an El Niño, report finds Read more\n\nDr Sam Dean, chief climate scientist at New Zealand’s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, said the paper indicated mankind will have to rely less on “fortuitously cool years” from natural processes. Instead of the cooling La Niñas experienced in the first decade of the century, he said there have been more warming El Niños since 2014 and this trend looks set to continue.\n\n“While we can’t be sure exactly how things will play out, at the moment the odds are higher for hot years,” he said.\n\nOther scientists praised the paper but concurred on the need for wider analysis. “The findings suggest it’s more likely we’ll get warmer years than expected in the next few years. But their method is purely statistical, so it’s important to see what climate models predict based on everything we know about the atmosphere and the oceans. Those are more expensive to run but also use more climate physics and observational information,” said Prof Gabi Hegerl of Edinburgh University.\n\nProfessor James Renwick of Victoria University of Wellington said the new forecasting system was clever, but its value will only be clear in the future. The broader trend, however, was clear.\n\n“If the warming trend caused by greenhouse gas emissions continues, years like 2018 will be the norm in the 2040s, and would be classed as cold by the end of the century,” he wrote.", 'title': "Extreme temperatures 'especially likely for next four years'", 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/aug/14/extreme-temperatures-especially-likely-for-next-four-years?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other', 'keywords': ['warming', 'temperatures', 'read', 'likely', 'climate', 'natural', 'extreme', 'scientist', 'trend', 'statistical', 'global', 'especially', 'forecasting'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'The world is likely to see more extreme temperatures in the coming four years as natural warming reinforces manmade climate change, according to a new global forecasting system.\nFrom 1998 to 2010, global temperatures were in a “hiatus” as natural cooling (from ocean circulation and weather systems) offset anthropogenic global warming.\n“Natural variability is a wriggle around the freight train that is global warming,” he says.\nWhat we don’t always feel is global warming.\n“If the warming trend caused by greenhouse gas emissions continues, years like 2018 will be the norm in the 2040s, and would be classed as cold by the end of the century,” he wrote.', 'date': 1534204800}, {'text': 'The UK nearly doubled the value of arms sales to countries on the government’s list of human rights abusers in the past year, figures reveal.\n\nLicences for arms deals worth some £1.5bn were approved in Whitehall in 2017, up from £820m a year earlier, according to figures compiled by the Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT) pressure group.\n\nSales were granted to 18 countries on the list, including China, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Israel, Egypt and Pakistan, compared to 20 different states in 2016.\n\nThe value of sales to Saudi Arabia, currently embroiled in a bloody conflict in Yemen against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels where thousands of civilians have been killed and millions left in need of aid, alone totalled £1.13bn, the group said.\n\nTheresa May’s government is “actively arming and supporting many of the regimes that even it believes are responsible for terrible human rights abuses”, CAAT’s Andrew Smith told The Independent.\n\nHe added: “There is little oversight in the system, and no controls over how these arms will be used once they have left the UK. The arms sales being agreed today could be used to fuel atrocities for years to come. Right now UK-made fighter jets and bombs are playing a central role in the Saudi-led destruction of Yemen, and the government and arms companies have totally failed to monitor or evaluate how this deadly equipment is being used.\n\n“We are always being told how rigorous and robust the system supposedly is, but nothing could be further from the truth. These arms sales don’t just provide dictatorships and human rights abusers with the means to kill, they also give them a huge degree of political support.”\n\nIsrael was the second-biggest buyer of UK arms in 2017 to feature on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s (FCO) human rights priority list, with £221m of licences granted.\n\nIn its watch list covering 2017, published this week, the FCO condemned Israel’s breaches of international law by its ongoing occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza and also “its systematic policy of settlement expansion”.\n\nRights abuses were also committed by Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, it said, including 19 death sentences passed and six carried out by the former.\n\nBahrain bought £30.7m of British arms in 2017, Egypt imported £6.5m of arms and Pakistan, £11.2m. Sales to China, which is cracking down further on freedom of speech and religion, totalled £11.8m.\n\nIn recent months, reports have emerged of Chinese authorities detaining Muslims for re-education. Some claim they have been forced to disavow their beliefs and praise the Communist Party daily while being held without access to a lawyer. “Thousands of [Uyghur Muslims] were held in re-education camps after returning from abroad” in 2017, the FCO said.\n\nIn Bangladesh, which bought £38.6m of arms, there were continued “credible reports of enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings and torture by government agencies”, the FCO said, though it noted that the Bangladeshi government had taken in more than 688,000 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar following ethnic cleansing and religious persecution there.\n\nWorld news in pictures 51 show all World news in pictures 1/51 27 August 2018 A police officer walks by the front of a Chicago Pizza and GLHF Game Bar at the scene of fatal shooting at The Jacksonville Landing.

Yahoo Japan’s Game Plus service allowed people to stream full games made for other platforms and to play HTML5 games on mobile phones, which would have allowed iPhone owners to get games without going through the App Store.\n\nNikkei reports that Yahoo Japan slashed the program’s budget last fall, just months after it launched, and told partners that it was due to pressure from Apple. It’s said to have begun filing complaints with Japan’s FTC around the same time.\n\nA major alternative could steal revenue from the App Store\n\nDevelopers essentially have no good alternative to the App Store on iOS. Their only other option is the web, which is a wonderful place for websites, but the web is rarely as fast or flashy as a native app. There are a great number of features that only native apps can take advantage of, which requires going through the App Store and giving Apple a 30 percent cut of most sales.\n\nYahoo Japan’s service was meant, in part, to be an alternative to that, offering better terms to developers, according to Nikkei, and fewer restrictions around how games were updated and sold. Final Fantasy creator Square Enix had even signed on and produced an exclusive game for the platform, which has since been pulled.\n\nWhile it’s hard to imagine a web platform stealing much attention away from the App Store, any alternative that works well enough would be a threat. That’s particularly important as Apple focuses more and more on revenue from its services division. As an example of what can happen: Google is expected to lose $50 million in just the next five months because Epic Games was able to skirt the Play Store when launching Fortnite on Android.\n\nOf course, game streaming is a difficult business that no one’s really managed to crack in a successful way just yet. So it’s unclear how competitive this service would have been. But Nikkei’s report would indicate that it was seen as a potential challenger. Nikkei didn’t receive comment from Apple or Yahoo Japan.\n\nYahoo Japan is no longer related to Yahoo (Yahoo had a stake in Yahoo Japan, but that stake remained behind in a holding company when Yahoo was purchased by Verizon). While it’s an independent entity, SoftBank owns very nearly half of Yahoo Japan, and this may have contributed to Game Plus’ demise. SoftBank handles payments to the App Store made by its mobile phone subscribers, taking a cut from those payments, and Nikkei reports that the company got involved with Yahoo to protect that revenue stream.\n\nIf that’s the case, it complicates what’s going on. And Nikkei warned that, because the companies involved may not be interested in helping with the investigation, it’s very possible the FTC won’t be able to prove any improper actions were taken.\n\nApple just recently managed to get out of another investigation from Japan’s FTC. The commission said that Apple may have violated antitrust rules by forcing a specific payment scheme on service providers selling the iPhone, but the company wasn’t punished because it agreed to make changes.', 'title': 'Japan regulator reportedly looking into whether Apple secretly crushed an App Store competitor', 'url': 'https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/15/17693856/apple-yahoo-japan-game-plus-antitrust-inquiry-ftc?utm_campaign=theverge&utm_content=entry&utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit', 'keywords': ['reportedly', 'games', 'service', 'regulator', 'japan', 'crushed', 'competitor', 'store', 'japans', 'app', 'nikkei', 'alternative', 'apple', 'game', 'secretly', 'looking'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Japan’s Fair Trade Commission is looking into whether Apple improperly pressured Yahoo Japan to shut down a game streaming platform that competed with the iOS App Store, according to Nikkei.\nNikkei reports that Yahoo Japan slashed the program’s budget last fall, just months after it launched, and told partners that it was due to pressure from Apple.\nA major alternative could steal revenue from the App StoreDevelopers essentially have no good alternative to the App Store on iOS.\nThere are a great number of features that only native apps can take advantage of, which requires going through the App Store and giving Apple a 30 percent cut of most sales.\nWhile it’s hard to imagine a web platform stealing much attention away from the App Store, any alternative that works well enough would be a threat.', 'date': 1534291200}, {'text': 'Image copyright Reuters Image caption John Brennan stepped down as CIA director in January 2017\n\nDonald Trump has revoked the security clearance of ex-CIA chief John Brennan, denying the US president\'s critic any access to sensitive information.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders announced the decision by reading a statement from Mr Trump.\n\nThe statement cited Mr Brennan\'s "erratic conduct and behaviour".\n\nIn response, Mr Brennan tweeted that the move was part of President Trump\'s broader effort to "suppress freedom of speech and punish critics".\n\n"It should gravely worry all Americans, including intelligence professionals, about the cost of speaking out.\n\n"My principles are worth far more than clearances.

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko) The Associated Press\n\nBy MARI YAMAGUCHI, Associated Press\n\nTOKYO (AP) — For his last time, Japan\'s Emperor Akihito addressed a memorial service Wednesday marking the end of World War II. Once again, he expressed "deep remorse" for the war.\n\nIt was in keeping with what by all appearances has become a mission for Akihito over his 30-year reign: to make amends for a war fought in the name of his father, Hirohito. The 84-year-old monarch is set to abdicate next spring.\n\n"Reflecting on our past and bearing in mind the feelings of deep remorse, I earnestly hope that the ravages of war will never be repeated," Akihito said in a two-minute speech on the 73rd anniversary of Japan\'s surrender.\n\nAs emperor, he has made unprecedented visits to the Philippines and other Pacific islands conquered by Japan early in World War II and devastated in fierce fighting as the U.S.-led allies took them back. Though Akihito has avoided a direct apology, he has subtly stepped up his expressions of regret in recent years in carefully scripted statements on the war.\n\nHis words have taken on greater importance as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has sought to move Japan beyond its troubled past since coming to power in December 2012. Opponents of Abe\'s policies have grabbed onto the emperor\'s statements as a counterbalance to the prime minister\'s push to revise Japan\'s war-renouncing constitution and build up its military.\n\nAkihito\'s World War II-related trips and pronouncements form part of a broader effort to bring the royal family closer to the public. In so doing, he has won over pacifists, leftists and other critics of the emperor system in a way his father was never able to do.\n\nHirohito, who was worshipped as a living god until the end of the war, remains a controversial figure even today, with historians still debating his responsibility for the war.\n\nDuring his father\'s reign, Akihito himself was almost hit by a Molotov cocktail on a 1975 visit to Japan\'s southern Okinawa island, where tens of thousands of civilians died in intense fighting near the end of World War II.\n\nHe has since visited the island 10 times. Okinawans warmly welcomed him and his wife Michiko earlier this year in what was likely his last as emperor.\n\nAkihito was 11 years old when he heard his father\'s voice announcing Japan\'s surrender on the radio on Aug. 15, 1945. During the subsequent U.S. occupation of Japan, he was tutored in English by Elizabeth Vining, a Quaker, an experience that experts say gave Akihito his pacifist and democratic outlook.\n\nThough Hirohito hardly changed the wording of his Aug. 15 message for a quarter century, Akihito\'s has evolved since he became emperor after his father\'s death in 1989.\n\nOn the 50th anniversary of the war\'s end in 1995, he expressed for the first time the hope that the same tragedy would never be repeated.\n\nThe same year, then-Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama acknowledged Japan\'s wartime aggression and made a landmark apology to victims in the rest of Asia.\n\nHis successors expressed remorse to other Asian countries until Abe dropped them and any reference to aggression in his Aug. 15 remarks beginning in 2013. He has pledged that Japan will not repeat the devastation of war, and did again Wednesday.\n\nAbe also sent a religious offering to a Tokyo shrine that honors the war dead, including convicted war criminals. He has avoided visiting the shrine since 2013 in a bid to avoid overly angering China and South Korea, which see the Yasukuni shrine as a symbol of Japan\'s military aggression.\n\nIn his 70th anniversary address in 2015, Akihito started using the expression he used Wednesday, stronger words than he had used previously.\n\nThe contrast with Abe captured media attention, with the prime minister portrayed as a nationalist pushing for a stronger military versus a pacifist Akihito. Abe wants Japan to stop dwelling on the past, while the emperor doesn\'t want his country to forget it.\n\nAkihito visited China early in his reign and has traveled to some of the harshest World War II battlefields in the Pacific. His 2005 visit to the U.S. territory of Saipan was hailed as a statement of his desire to be part of the postwar healing process. Akihito traveled to the western Pacific nation of Palau in 2015 and the Philippines in 2016.\n\nWhile his Aug. 15 address is always short, Akihito has expressed his thoughts about the war more clearly in annual birthday remarks and on overseas trips. He has repeatedly stressed the importance of studying history and passing it down to the next generations.\n\n"Now that the memories of the war have started to fade, I think it is extremely important for everyone to study time and again the course of history Japan has followed and to reflect on peace," he said in his 2011 birthday address.\n\nHis son, Crown Prince Naruhito, has largely echoed his father\'s pacifist stance, but it is unclear if the first postwar-generation emperor will be able to strike a similar chord with today\'s younger Japanese.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show Akihito visited Saipan in 2005.\n\n___\n\nFollow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi\n\nFind her work at https://www.apnews.com/search/mari%20yamaguchi', 'title': "Japanese Emperor Tries to Make Amends for His Father's War", 'url': 'https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2018-08-14/japans-emperor-makes-last-war-end-anniversary-speech', 'keywords': ['emperor', 'fathers', 'war', 'tries', 'japan', 'expressed', 'japans', 'aug', '15', 'akihito', 'amends', 'world', 'end', 'japanese'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': "Japan's Emperor Akihito walks from a door to attend a memorial service for the war dead at Nippon Budokan martial arts hall Wednesday, Aug. 15, 2018, in Tokyo.\nEmperor Akihito has expressed deep remorse over his country's role in World War II as he made his last appearance at a ceremony marking the end of the hostilities.\n(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko) The Associated PressBy MARI YAMAGUCHI, Associated PressTOKYO (AP) — For his last time, Japan's Emperor Akihito addressed a memorial service Wednesday marking the end of World War II.\nAkihito's World War II-related trips and pronouncements form part of a broader effort to bring the royal family closer to the public.\nAkihito visited China early in his reign and has traveled to some of the harshest World War II battlefields in the Pacific.", 'date': 1534204800}, {'text': 'Source: Xinhua| 2018-08-16 01:15:40|Editor: yan\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nWASHINGTON, Aug. 15 (Xinhua) -- American researchers have restored for the first time vision in mice through activating retinal stem cells, advancing effort toward therapies for retinal degenerative diseases which currently have no cure.\n\nResearchers reported in a study published on Wednesday in the journal Nature that they reversed congenital blindness in mice by changing supportive cells in the retina called Muller glia into rod photoreceptors.\n\n"This is the first report of scientists reprogramming Muller glia to become functional rod photoreceptors in the mammalian retina," said Thomas Greenwell, the program director for retinal neuroscience of the National Eye Institute that funded the study.\n\nPhotoreceptors are light-sensitive cells in the retina in the back of the eye that signal the brain when activated. In mammals, including mice and humans, photoreceptors fail to regenerate on their own.\n\n"Rods allow us to see in low light, but they may also help preserve cone photoreceptors, which are important for color vision and high visual acuity.

If rods can be regenerated from inside the eye, this might be a strategy for treating diseases of the eye that affect photoreceptors," said Greenwell.\n\nMuller glia had been found with regenerative potential in zebrafish where they divide in response to injury and turn into photoreceptors and other retinal neurons.\n\nHowever, from a practical standpoint, it is counterproductive to injure retina first to activate the Muller glia for a person, according to Chen Bo, associate professor of ophthalmology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.\n\n"We wanted to see if we could program Muller glia to become rod photoreceptors in a living mouse without having to injure its retina," said Chen, the study\'s lead investigator.\n\nONE-TWO PUNCH\n\nIn the first phase, Chen\'s team spurred Muller glia in normal mice to divide by injecting their eyes with a gene to turn on a protein called beta-catenin.\n\nWeeks later, they injected the mice\'s eyes with factors that encouraged the newly divided cells to develop into rod photoreceptors.\n\nThe researchers found that the newly formed rod photoreceptors looked structurally no different from real photoreceptors.\n\nIn addition, synaptic structures that allow the rods to communicate with other types of neurons within the retina had also formed.\n\nTo determine whether the Muller glia-derived rod photoreceptors were functional, they tested the treatment in mice with congenital blindness.\n\nFunctionally, they confirmed that the newly formed rods were communicating with other types of retinal neurons across synapses.\n\nAlso, light responses recorded from retinal ganglion cells, neurons that carry signals from photoreceptors to the brain, and measurements of brain activity showed that the newly-formed rods were in fact integrating in the visual pathway circuitry.\n\nChen\'s lab is planning to see if the technique works on cultured human retinal tissue.', 'title': 'Researchers restore mice vision using retinal stem cells - Xinhua', 'url': 'http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-08/16/c_137393260.htm', 'keywords': ['mice', 'eye', 'retinal', 'cells', 'rods', 'using', 'restore', 'xinhua', 'photoreceptors', 'retina', 'muller', 'stem', 'glia', 'researchers', 'rod', 'vision'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': "Source: Xinhua| 2018-08-16 01:15:40|Editor: yanVideo Player CloseWASHINGTON, Aug. 15 (Xinhua) -- American researchers have restored for the first time vision in mice through activating retinal stem cells, advancing effort toward therapies for retinal degenerative diseases which currently have no cure.\nResearchers reported in a study published on Wednesday in the journal Nature that they reversed congenital blindness in mice by changing supportive cells in the retina called Muller glia into rod photoreceptors.\nWeeks later, they injected the mice's eyes with factors that encouraged the newly divided cells to develop into rod photoreceptors.\nThe researchers found that the newly formed rod photoreceptors looked structurally no different from real photoreceptors.\nTo determine whether the Muller glia-derived rod photoreceptors were functional, they tested the treatment in mice with congenital blindness.", 'date': 1534377600}, {'text': 'Maxim Neverov, 16, was asked in late July to go to the police station in his hometown, Biysk, a small city near Russia’s southern border. Accompanied by his father, Neverov eventually discovered he was called — and subsequently detained — because of images he had saved to a photo album on the Russian social media platform Vkontakte.\n\nThen on Aug. 7, two weeks after he was detained, Neverov became the first minor charged under Russia’s so-called gay propaganda law.\n\n“The photos showed guys hugging. I didn’t publish them, just saved them in an album,” Neverov told NBC News this week in an email. “One of the photos said, ‘Love is better than f-----g.’ I saved them and forgot about them — just as tens of thousands of teenagers do all across Russia.”\n\nNeverov said he deleted the images from his account after he was detained. He also said he did not admit guilt during his detainment, referring to an article in Russian law that prevents someone from testifying against himself.\n\n“I never thought they would charge me according to this," Neverov said of the law. "Biysk officials don’t like what I do, and instead of fixing things that I and many people don’t like, they fine these people."\n\nRussia’s “gay propaganda” law, passed in 2013 by the Russian legislature, makes any act or event that authorities deem to promote homosexuality to minors illegal and punishable by a fine. Neverov was fined 50,000 rubles ($736) — more than the average monthly salary in Russia.\n\nGay rights activists mark the International Day against homophobia, transphobia and biphobia in St. Petersburg, Russia, on May 17, 2017. Dmitri Lovetsky / AP\n\nSince its inception, the legislation has been used to prevent gay pride parades and detain LGBTQ activists. The passage of the law has also been accompanied by an increase in anti-LGBTQ violence in the country, activists and researchers have claimed.\n\nIn 2017, the European Court of Human Rights, of which Russia is a member, ruled against the controversial legislation.\n\n"By adopting such laws, the authorities had reinforced stigma and prejudice and encouraged homophobia, which was incompatible with the values of a democratic society,” the court said in a statement when it made its decision.\n\nNeverov now joins the growing crowd of LGBTQ activists detained and fined due to the propaganda law. Just last week, around two dozen gay activists were detained in St. Petersburg after protesting the city’s rejection of their application to hold a gay pride event.\n\nA demonstrator is detained by police during the LGBTQ community rally in central St. Petersburg, Russia, on Aug. 4, 2018. Stringer / Reuters\n\nPrior to Neverov’s detainment on July 24, authorities were already familiar with him because of his activism. Their interest in the teen grew after he became involved with Protest Biysk, a group that organizes civil rights projects.\n\nIn May, Neverov was the lead organizer of a performance called “Gays or Putin.” As part of this performance, he submitted 12 applications to city officials for a wide range of public events — some in support of LGBTQ rights and some in support of Russian President Vladimir Putin, including one that satirically called for Putin to be recognized as a saint.\n\nNot only did authorities reject all of Neverov\'s applications, but, according to Neverov, they published his phone number and address on the internet.\n\n“It is very difficult to talk about the rights of LGBTQ people in Russia, because the whole state machine led by Putin despises this community,” Neverov lamented.\n\nThe Russian LGBT Network, an organization with chapters throughout the country, has assisted Neverov after his detainment. Svetlana Zakharova, the network’s communications manager, said the advocacy group believes the charges against him are because of his political work.\n\n“It’s nonsense,” Zakharova said, referring to the charges. “Neverov is a schoolboy who cannot work, yet the fine he is supposed to pay is double the average salary of his city.”\n\nZakharova said if Neverov and his family are unable to pay, then the Russian LGBT Network will raise the money for the fine.\n\nArtem Lapov, Neverov’s lawyer, told NBC News the charges against Neverov violate his right to freedom of expression. He also said there were a number of procedural violations involved in his client’s case, including the inability of his Neverov’s supporters to attend a supposedly public hearing about the case.\n\nLapov said he is ready to appeal Neverov’s case all the way to the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nSince the charges were filed against him last week, Neverov’s situation has been brought to international attention. ILGA-Europe, an LGBTQ advocacy organization with a presence across the continent, condemned the charges against Neverov as persecuting a politically active youth.\n\n“Young people in the region are stepping up their participation in social and political movements despite the risks,” the organization said in a statement sent to NBC News. “As a result, they are being targeted in many different ways.”\n\n“It is important to remember that 16-year-old Maxim joins a whole array of outspoken or simply critical young people (LGBTI and non LGBTI alike) who have been targeted with different charges/laws in Russia,” ILGA-Europe continued. “Some of them — like 18-year-old Anna Pavlikova — are even facing criminal charges, not administrative fines.”\n\nIn its latest LGBTQ equality ranking of European countries, ILGA-Europe ranks Russia 45th out of 49 countries.\n\nRachel Denber, deputy director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division, called Russia’s gay propaganda law “profoundly discriminatory and wrong.”\n\n“We have been calling for the law to be repealed ever since it was adopted,” she said.\n\nDenber noted there have been a number of cases over the past few months in Russia’s Altai Krai region, where Biysk is and “where local officials have gone after people who are active online and were government critics.”\n\n“He’s not the only one,” Denber told NBC News. “I’m not sure if it’s coincidental or not, but it’s definitely worth noting.”\n\nDespite the charges and the fine, Neverov said he will continue to be politically active, noting he became an activist because he was “tired of watching what was happening in the country.”\n\n“It\'s terrible,” he said. “In our country, people are tortured and killed in prisons, schoolchildren are intimidated only because they oppose Putin\'s regime.”\n\n“Protest Biysk is sure that if the administration is so afraid of us, then we need to continue,” Neverov added. “We have everything that is needed: people, ideas, desire.”\n\nHowever, he noted one thing missing is “money to implement these ideas,” so he said the next step is raising funds to work on projects related to political prisoners.\n\nAs for fear of the Russian authorities, Neverov said that ship has sailed.\n\n“I wasn’t afraid,” he said of being detained. “The police have not scared me for a long time.”\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misstated the title of Neverov\'s performance.

Once they are too dangerous for that, some are sold for canned hunts, in which they are shot by trophy-hunters in fenced areas from which they cannot escape,” said a spokeswoman for the charity.\n\n“Others are killed for the bone trade, either for display or for use in bogus medicinal tonics in Asia.”\n\nIt is impossible to differentiate between body parts from wild and captive animals so the legal export of bones from farm-bred caged lions allows the illegal export of wild lion bones to continue, and allows the market to thrive.\n\nA star of hit film The No 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency is backing HSI’s campaign urging visitors to shun lion attractions, branded “snuggle scams”.\n\nActress Pearl Thusi condemned the “cruel and sad” exploitation of lions, listed as vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\n\nThusi, who played Patricia Kopong in the Botswana-based films, said: “Now that I know the truth behind the captive lion-breeding industry and the exploitation of these lions from birth to death, I am horrified that this is how we treat the king of the jungle.\n\n“We should promote Africa as an authentic, wild and rewarding tourism destination and not support this industry.”\n\nI am horrified that this is how we treat the king of the jungle\n\nSouth Africa has fewer than 3,000 lions in the wild - but up to 8,000 in captivity in 260 breeding farms.\n\nLast year 16 million tourists visited South Africa, according to Statista.com, and numbers are forecast to grow, potentially fuelling a rise in popularity of lion farms and “canned” trophy-hunts.\n\nWhere not to visit if you love animals 9 show all Where not to visit if you love animals 1/9 Monkey shows Chimpanzees are forced to perform demeaning tricks on leashes and are often subject to cruel training techniques.

Because these animals are usually kept in fenced enclosures (ranging in size from just a few square yards to thousands of acres), they never stand a chance of surviving.

The bulls who are forced to slip and slide down the town\'s narrow cobblestone streets are chased straight into the bullring. They are then taunted, stabbed repeatedly and finally killed by the matador in front of a jeering crowd. The majority of Spaniards reject bullfighting, but tourists are keeping the cruel industry on its last legs. Getty Images 8/9 Horse-drawn carriages City streets are no place for horses. The animals toil in all weather extremes, suffering from respiratory distress from breathing in exhaust fumes as well as numerous hoof, leg and back problems from walking on pavement all day long.

Zoos breed animals because the presence of babies draws visitors and boosts revenue, yet often, there\'s nowhere to put the offspring as they grow, and they are killed, as we recently saw with Marius the giraffe in Denmark. Some zoos have introduced evening events with loud music and alcohol which disrupt the incarcerated animals even further.

Most of them will have been bred in captivity and then taken from their mothers to be hand-reared by the cub-petting industry. When they get too big, they may be drugged before they are released into a "hunting" enclosure. Because these animals are usually kept in fenced enclosures (ranging in size from just a few square yards to thousands of acres), they never stand a chance of surviving. Getty Images 7/9 Running of the Bulls Every year, tourists travel to Pamplona for the Running of the Bulls. The bulls who are forced to slip and slide down the town\'s narrow cobblestone streets are chased straight into the bullring. They are then taunted, stabbed repeatedly and finally killed by the matador in front of a jeering crowd. The majority of Spaniards reject bullfighting, but tourists are keeping the cruel industry on its last legs. Getty Images 8/9 Horse-drawn carriages City streets are no place for horses. The animals toil in all weather extremes, suffering from respiratory distress from breathing in exhaust fumes as well as numerous hoof, leg and back problems from walking on pavement all day long. As easily spooked prey animals, horses subjected to the loud noises and unexpected sounds of city streets are likely to be involved in accidents, even deadly ones. Getty Images 9/9 Zoos The zoo community regards the animals it keeps as commodities, and animals are regularly bought, sold, borrowed and traded without any regard for established relationships. Zoos breed animals because the presence of babies draws visitors and boosts revenue, yet often, there\'s nowhere to put the offspring as they grow, and they are killed, as we recently saw with Marius the giraffe in Denmark. Some zoos have introduced evening events with loud music and alcohol which disrupt the incarcerated animals even further.
