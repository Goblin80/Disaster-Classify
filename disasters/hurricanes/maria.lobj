[{'text': 'Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Watch: The islanders caught between hurricanes\n\nHurricane Maria has strengthened to a major category three hurricane, US forecasters say, as it heads towards the Leeward Islands in the Caribbean.\n\nIt is due to hit on Monday night local time.\n\nMaria is moving roughly along the same path as Irma, the hurricane that devastated the region this month.\n\nThe authorities fear Maria could whip up and throw the debris left behind by Hurricane Irma.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Paul Maynard, a Royal Marine deployed to the British Virgin Islands, told the Press Association the hurricane could pick the debris up, "spin it around, and throw it like ammunition".\n\n"It could cause potentially more casualties and fatalities than Irma did," he added.\n\nThe UK\'s International Development Secretary, Priti Patel, said: "British troops, police and aid experts are working relentlessly to get help to the victims of Hurricane Irma. Those same individuals will now be tasked with also preparing for the impact of Maria."\n\nHurricane warnings have been issued for Guadeloupe, Dominica, St Kitts and Nevis, Montserrat, Martinique, St Lucia and the US and British Virgin Islands.\n\nA hurricane watch is in effect for Puerto Rico, St Martin, St Barts, Saba, St Eustatius and Anguilla.\n\nSome of these islands are still recovering after being hit by Irma - a category five hurricane which left at least 37 people dead and caused billions of dollars\' worth of damage.\n\nIn its latest update on Monday, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said that Maria had maximum sustained winds of 200km/h (125mph).\n\nThey warned that heavy rainfall caused by the hurricane "could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides".\n\nThe eye of the storm is 100 miles east of Martinique, and Maria is moving west-northwest at about 13mph.\n\n"Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion," the NHC said.\n\nIn the French territory of Guadeloupe, schools, businesses and government buildings have all been closed and severe flooding is predicted in low-lying parts of the islands.\n\nPreparations have also begun in Puerto Rico, where Maria is expected to bring strong winds on Tuesday.\n\nThe Leeward Islands - where Maria will first strike - includes Antigua and Barbuda. The latter island was evacuated after being devastated by Irma.\n\nThe NHC says that Maria could produce a "dangerous storm surge accompanied by large and destructive waves" that would raise water levels by as much as 2.7 metres (9ft).\n\nIt also forecasts a maximum potential rainfall of 51cm (20in) in some areas of the central and southern Leeward Islands - including Puerto Rico and the US and British Virgin Islands - through to Wednesday night.\n\nThe destruction of Barbuda\n\nDrone footage of Saint-Martin after Irma\n\nEarlier this month, Irma left more than two-thirds of homes on the Dutch side of the island of St Martin (known as Sint Maarten) uninhabitable, with no electricity, gas or drinking water.\n\nThe French government has said its side of St Martin - known as Saint-Martin - sustained about €1.2bn ($1.44bn; £1.1bn) in damage, with nine deaths across Saint-Martin and nearby St Barts.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A BBC team visited Caribbean islands that have been devastated by Hurricane Irma\n\nOn the British Virgin Islands, entire neighbourhoods were flattened.\n\nAfter a visit to the area, UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson described the damage as something "you see in images from the First World War".\n\nIn pictures: Irma devastates British Virgin Islands\n\nVirgin boss Richard Branson, who has a home in the Virgin Islands, has been tweeting ahead of the Maria\'s predicted arrival, warning people to stay safe.\n\nThe Puerto Rican government has issued a statement saying it expects the hurricane to make landfall there as a category three on Tuesday.\n\nThe US territory escaped the worst of the damage from Irma - although it experienced widespread power cuts - and it has been an important hub for getting relief to islands that were more badly affected.\n\n"Puerto Rico is our lifeline," Judson Burdon, a resident of Anguilla, told Reuters news agency.

The island nation\'s prime minister posted on Facebook that the roofs were torn off the homes of almost every person he had spoken to. "My roof is gone. I am at the complete mercy of the hurricane," Roosevelt Skerrit posted. In another Facebook post, the prime minister said, "Initial reports are of widespread devastation.

The hurricane is also expected to dump about 25 inches (63.5 centimeters) of rainfall in some isolated pockets of Puerto Rico.

Ricardo Rosselló predicted a long period of recovery. Anxious relatives in the mainland United States and elsewhere took to social media in an effort to find news of their loved ones.\n\nLate Thursday, the mayor of Toa Baja, a town in northern Puerto Rico, told The New York Times that eight people had drowned there after flooding. That brought to at least 10 the number who have died in Puerto Rico as a result of Hurricane Maria, a toll that is expected to climb.\n\nPuerto Rico faces numerous obstacles as it begins to emerge from the storm: the weight of an extended debt and bankruptcy crisis; a recovery process begun after Irma, which killed at least three people and left nearly 70 percent of households without power; the difficulty of getting to an island far from the mainland; and the strain on relief efforts by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other groups already spread thin in the wake of several recent storms.\n\n“Irma gave us a break, but Maria destroyed us,” said Edwin Serrano, a construction worker in Old San Juan.\n\nThe storm churned off the northern coast of the Dominican Republic as a Category 3 hurricane on Thursday, and the National Hurricane Center repeated hurricane warnings for late Thursday and early Friday morning for the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos.\n\nHere’s the latest:\n\n• At least eight people died after drowning in different parts of Toa Baja, the mayor of the town, Bernardo Márquez, said in an interview. The mayor said that storm surge and river overflows had burst through open floodgates and that alarms did not sound when the floodgates were opened because of faulty maintenance. Three children and a police officer were among the dead, he said.\n\nThe newly reported deaths came after Governor Rosselló told CNN late Wednesday that officials knew of one fatality in the commonwealth involving a man who was hit by a board. The United States Coast Guard also reported the death of a man aboard a capsized vessel near Vieques, P.R.\n\n• The death toll from Hurricane Maria has risen to at least 15 on the small Caribbean island of Dominica, according to Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit. Two people were also killed on the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, officials said.\n\n• Forecasters say Puerto Rico will see up to an additional eight inches of rain through Saturday, adding to the several feet of rain that has fallen on parts of the island. Caguas, in the central mountains, has received the most rain on the island during Maria, 37.9 inches, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n• There is significant concern about the expected “life-threatening” storm surge of nine to 12 feet in the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos, according to Michael Brennan of the National Hurricane Center.\n\n• President Trump said Thursday that he would visit Puerto Rico, but he gave no details on the timing of the trip.\n\n• In Puerto Rico, Governor Rosselló had previously set a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew effective until Saturday. On Thursday, he requested that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York help with recovery efforts. Governor Cuomo will travel to Puerto Rico with key emergency response officials as early as Friday morning, his office said in a statement.\n\n• In the United States Virgin Islands, Gov. Kenneth E. Mapp announced that a 24-hour curfew would be scaled back on three islands beginning on Friday morning. And although the full curfew remained in place on St. Croix, Governor Mapp said residents would be allowed to leave their homes to get supplies during a four-hour window on Friday.\n\n• In the British Virgin Islands, government officials issued an all clear at 9 a.m. on Thursday morning, lifting a curfew that had been in effect since 6 p.m. on Tuesday.\n\nPhoto\n\n• Sign up for the Morning Briefing for hurricane news and a daily look at what you need to know to begin your day.

She suggested that without electricity, many of the pumps that supplied residents with running water would not be functioning.\n\nComplicating matters, more than 95 percent of the island’s wireless cell sites are out of service, said Ajit Pai, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nRicardo Ramos, the chief executive of the government-owned Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, told CNN on Thursday that the island’s power infrastructure had essentially been “destroyed.”\n\nA seaside area is smashed by the storm.\n\nPhoto\n\nResidents and business owners in the Condado area of San Juan began to trickle into the streets on Thursday to assess the havoc. Joggers ran past what resembled a beachside battlefield. Bikers pedaled slowly, taking in the overwhelming damage.\n\nCondado, the tourist district of the island, which has seen a reawakening of sorts with the opening of new hotels and restaurant chains over the last couple of years, was ravaged. Windows were blown out in the apartment buildings and hotels that line the promenade. A restaurant lost its roof. Parque del Indio, a popular seaside park for skaters and joggers, was blanketed with sand and water.\n\n“It’s total destruction,” said Angie Mok, a property manager. “This will be a renaissance.”\n\nMs. Mok’s fourth-floor seaside apartment was destroyed. Her apartment had no shutters, and the wind rattled her belongings, while ankle-high water soaked the floors.\n\nIn Old San Juan, which like most of the island was without reliable cell service, people were thirsty for information. At Plaza de Armas, residents sat on benches and stoops to share what information they had. Those with radios were tuning in to the only station broadcasting in the entire island.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He also noted that Puerto Ricans are old hands when it comes to surviving devastating storms.\n\nMore than five million Puerto Ricans live on the mainland, more than the population of the island itself, and the worry and stress were widely shared Thursday among those watching from afar. It was a feeling of “impotence,” said Eliezer Vélez, 44, of Atlanta.\n\n“You’re here, but your mind and your heart are on the island,” he said. “We are here, but we belong there. I cannot describe the frustration that I’m not there.”\n\nPuerto Rico is in ‘perilous shape,’ Trump says.\n\nVideo\n\n“Puerto Rico was absolutely obliterated,” President Trump said during a meeting with President Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine at the United Nations in New York on Thursday.\n\n“Their electrical grid is destroyed,” Mr. Trump added. “It wasn’t in good shape to start off with. But their electrical grid is totally destroyed. And so many other things.”\n\nMr. Trump has declared Puerto Rico a disaster area, and he said he was consulting with Governor Rosselló and federal officials about the recovery effort. “We are going to start it with great gusto,” he said. “But it’s in very, very, very perilous shape. Very sad what happened to Puerto Rico.”\n\nDespite the challenges his island faces, Governor Rosselló said on Twitter that “we will come out of this stronger than ever.”\n\nIn an interview with WAPA radio on Thursday, Mr. Rosselló said that reopening the island’s ports was a priority, because it would allow for shipments of aid, including generators, food, cots and first aid materials.\n\nThe White House has also declared the United States Virgin Islands a disaster area, to make federal funding available for residents of St. Croix.\n\nGovernor Mapp said that the western end of St. Croix had taken what he called a “beating.” At least one school there appeared to have been destroyed, and portions of another had been seriously damaged. The power system was down on the island, he added.\n\nJuan F. Luis Hospital has also been serious damaged, he said, adding that dozens of patients would be evacuated as soon as Friday — potentially as far as South Carolina.\n\nGovernor Mapp said officials were not aware of “any significant number” of people who had been injured by Maria or of any deaths connected to the storm.\n\n“The worst is finally behind us,” Mr. Mapp said. “Now it’s really time to march forward.”\n\nDominica grapples with widespread destruction.", 'title': 'Hurricane Maria Updates: In Puerto Rico, the Storm ‘Destroyed Us’', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/21/us/hurricane-maria-puerto-rico.html', 'keywords': ['rico', 'hurricane', 'power', 'islands', 'destroyed', 'updates', 'united', 'storm', 'maria', 'puerto', 'island', 'governor', 'york'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Read the latest on Hurricane Maria with Friday’s live updates.\nPuerto Rico remained in the throes of chaos and devastation Thursday as the remnants of Hurricane Maria continued to dump rain on the island — up to three feet in some areas.\nThat brought to at least 10 the number who have died in Puerto Rico as a result of Hurricane Maria, a toll that is expected to climb.\n• President Trump said Thursday that he would visit Puerto Rico, but he gave no details on the timing of the trip.\n• In Puerto Rico, Governor Rosselló had previously set a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew effective until Saturday.', 'date': 1505952000}, {'text': 'Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Heavy rainfall from Hurricane Maria put stress on the Guajataca Dam\n\nA failing dam is causing "extremely dangerous" flooding on a Puerto Rico river in the wake of Hurricane Maria, authorities say.\n\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) said the "imminent failure" of the Guajataca Dam was a "life-threatening situation".\n\nMore than 70,000 people live in the nearby areas of Isabela and Quebradillas.\n\nAt least 13 people have died since Maria ripped through Puerto Rico, knocking out power to the whole island.\n\nThe Guajataca Dam, at the northern end of Lake Guajataca in the north-west, began to show signs of failing at 14:10 local time (18:10 GMT) on Friday, operators said.\n\nThe NWS warned of flash flooding in Isabela and Quebradillas.\n\nAll 70,000 residents were initially told to flee but there are reports that the evacuation zone has since been narrowed.\n\nThe agency urged residents in the area to move to higher ground in an alert posted on its website.

The storm ravaged the island on September 20th, and then continued to deluge it with rain the next day. It knocked out the electrical grid—it will take months to restore power to the whole island—and put an end to most mobile communication. It rendered many roads and bridges impassable. (In the storm’s immediate aftermath, before relief workers distributed satellite phones, some parts of the island could be contacted only by runners.) The Federal Emergency Management Agency is providing help, relying in part on the $15.3bn in funding that Congress allocated for disaster relief earlier in September, after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma struck Texas and Florida, respectively. But the island’s governor, Ricardo Roselló, is in no doubt that more help is needed. Otherwise, he says, the island faces a “humanitarian crisis”.\n\nEven if that plea is met, it is unlikely to stop the long-term damage to the island. Before the storm, Puerto Rico already faced an economic collapse. Having borrowed too much, and seen its economy shrink almost every year since 2005, the island commenced bankruptcy-like proceedings in May. That was possible because of a federal law passed in 2016. Until then, unlike states and municipalities, it had no way to escape its unpayable $123bn in debt and pension obligations (worth 180% of gross national income, GNI). The price for the escape route was a new financial oversight board, appointed in Washington.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government had hoped to balance its budget over three years by imposing austerity worth over 5% of GNI annually. But even before Maria struck, the oversight board did not think the plan was credible. It was insisting on furloughs for the island’s public-sector workers to ensure the targets were met. Mr Roselló refused to comply, and faced a lawsuit over the matter in the island’s federal court (he said he was willing to go to prison over the matter). That dispute now looks like a sideshow—just as well, given that the hurricane has caused the court to close indefinitely.\n\nPuerto Ricans, who are American citizens, have been abandoning the island. At last count, it was losing on net 68,000 people a year, or 1.9% of its population. Those who have stayed are ageing, like the rest of America. Now Puerto Rico must also contend with people fleeing a natural disaster. A recent working paper by economists Leah Boustan, Matthew Kahn, Paul Rhode and Maria Yanguas examines American natural disasters from 1920 to 2010. It finds that a severe disaster lowers net migration into a given county by between 2.3 and 5.9 percentage points. Puerto Rico is no county; it has fully 3.4m residents. But even an effect one-tenth of that size would be disastrous, calculates Lyman Stone, an economist who blogs about migration. The effect also seems greatest in areas which are prone to disasters, perhaps because residents fear a repeat episode. In Puerto Rico’s case, such a fear would be especially well-founded, given that climate change is likely to increase the intensity of hurricanes. Mr Roselló warns of a “mass exodus”.\n\nHowever, the island may not see the large scale depopulation that follows some catastrophes. Moving requires resources, and 44% of Puerto Rico’s residents earn less than the federal poverty line. Many high earners have already departed. In the decade to 2016, the number of surgeons and physicians on the island fell by almost one-third. A new IMF study finds that extreme weather events increase emigration, but only from places that people can afford to leave.\n\nThat, however, is hardly a comforting thought. The IMF’s other findings are equally grim. Seven years after an average hurricane, typhoon or cyclone strikes a small country, output per head is almost 2.5% lower than it otherwise would have been. Even 20 years after being hit, economies typically have not fully recovered.\n\nWhat can be done? Apart from ensuring the island gets immediate help—including suspending the Jones Act, which requires all ships sailing between American ports to be built, owned and crewed by American citizens—there are several ways Congress could support Puerto Rico’s economy in the long term. Lawmakers could extend the earned-income tax credit, a wage top-up for low earners, to the island’s residents. They could ensure Medicaid, health insurance for the poor, is adequately funded (federal Medicaid contributions to Puerto Rico, unlike those to states, are capped). And it could waive the usual requirement that the island pay for 10-25% of its disaster relief.\n\nThe argument against doing these things is that Puerto Ricans do not pay federal income taxes. But the alternative is a vicious cycle of austerity, recession and a shrinking population, now compounded by a natural disaster.", 'title': 'Puerto Rico could feel the effects of Hurricane Maria for decades', 'url': 'https://www.economist.com/united-states/2017/09/30/puerto-rico-could-feel-the-effects-of-hurricane-maria-for-decades', 'keywords': ['rico', 'disaster', 'residents', 'effects', 'islands', 'decades', 'american', 'roselló', 'feel', 'maria', 'federal', 'hurricane', 'island', 'ricos', 'puerto'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'THE full extent of the catastrophic damage Hurricane Maria has done to Puerto Rico is not yet known.\nBefore the storm, Puerto Rico already faced an economic collapse.\nIn Puerto Rico’s case, such a fear would be especially well-founded, given that climate change is likely to increase the intensity of hurricanes.\nMoving requires resources, and 44% of Puerto Rico’s residents earn less than the federal poverty line.\nThey could ensure Medicaid, health insurance for the poor, is adequately funded (federal Medicaid contributions to Puerto Rico, unlike those to states, are capped).', 'date': 1506729600}, {'text': "Since Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico a week ago, Isabello Aponte’s life has been confined to the four concrete walls of his modest home.

A key difference between the two systems is that commercial healthcare is much less popular and consumers largely use Medicaid and Medicare – government insurance programs that help cover low-income and older Americans.\n\n\n\nTo pay for these services, the territory routinely borrowed money by issuing municipal bonds – as it did in other branches of government. As the island’s debt ballooned, the government kept issuing bonds.\n\nNow, the island faces a $73bn debt and a humanitarian crisis.\n\nDamage caused by the storm is likely to make a difficult situation worse Stephen Zuckerman\n\nEarlier this week, Donald Trump switched his attention briefly from his spat with black NFL players, and tweeted that the debt “sadly, must be dealt with”.\n\nOn Tuesday Nydia Velázquez, a Democratic representative from New York, said she was concerned that Trump’s continued focus on a row over protesting sportsmen reflected a misunderstanding of the severity of the crisis.\n\nReferring to criticism of George W Bush following the hurricane that devastated New Orleans in 2005, she warned the president: “If you don’t take this crisis seriously this is going to be your Katrina.”\n\nSo far, Maria has been linked to more than 30 deaths across the Caribbean – including at least 15 in Puerto Rico – but Dr Rafael Rodríguez-Mercado, Puerto Rico’s health secretary, has said it’s fair to assume people that the number will rise.\n\n\n\nThe majority of the island’s 69 hospitals are without electricity or fuel for generators, according to the US Department of Defense.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hospital employees and nurses gather to pray for a co-worker who was critically injured in a violent attack during the chaos post-Maria.

Ramon Espinosa / AP\n\nPuerto Rico\'s Fiscal Oversight Board, which came into power after Congress passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) in 2016, controls the island’s budget and finances.\n\nThe budget it approved for Puerto Rico in Fiscal Year 2018 called for a reduction in the island’s budget by 9 percent over its previous one.\n\nHowever, this shrinking budget did not take into account a crippling hit like Maria, which, according to Jennifer Gonzalez, Puerto Rico’s Resident Commissioner and lone non-voting representation in Congress, set Puerto Rico back “nearly 20 to 30 years.”\n\nRELATED: Medical Team Races to Find Puerto Rico\'s Most Vulnerable\n\nThe time to help Puerto Rico is now. Unless Congress provides full Medicaid funding for the island, either thousands of Puerto Ricans will be at risk of perishing due to lack of health care, or thousands more individuals and families will leave to the continental United States in search of medical services.\n\nAfter Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico faces significantly higher chances of a public health outbreak. If the health care system collapses due to lack of funding or an increased demand for services —compounded with the lack of food, water or sanitation —the death toll from Maria is likely to increase.\n\nSaving Puerto Rico from the Medicaid Cliff is in the best interests of continental U.S. residents. Studies show that taking this action could save U.S. taxpayers close to $30 billion, as estimates show that it can be up to 3 times cheaper to treat Medicaid patients in Puerto Rico than in the continental United States. It is critical that full Medicaid funding for Puerto Rico is restored.\n\nPuerto Rico\'s inhabitants have been U.S. citizens for over 100 years. No Puerto Rican, U.S. citizen, or for that matter, any human being, should depend on his or her photo going “viral” in order to receive life-saving medical care.\n\nAs Puerto Rico and the federal government begin the long and arduous task of putting the island back together again, it\'s vital that the U.S. government fully restores Medicaid funding for Puerto Rico. Otherwise, more than 25 percent of Puerto Rico\'s residents are at risk of losing all access to healthcare.\n\nAt this time of great crisis and uncertainty for the island and its people, both Congress and the President must act decisively to spare Puerto Rico from suffering a man made disaster on top of a natural one.\n\nFollow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.', 'title': "Opinion: After Hurricane Maria, Let's Avoid a Man-Made Disaster in Puerto Rico", 'url': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/opinion-after-hurricane-maria-let-s-avoid-man-made-disaster-n806541', 'keywords': ['rico', 'disaster', 'avoid', 'health', 'hurricane', 'medicaid', 'congress', 'manmade', 'maria', 'opinion', 'funding', 'puerto', 'island', 'lets', 'ricos'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': "They have three children, one lives in Chicago and two live with them in Puerto Rico.\nRELATED: Opinion: Trump’s Tweets on Puerto Rico Are a National DisgraceIn April 2017, Democrats recognized that this grant was about to expire, and requested the Republican administration for an additional $900 million dollars in Medicaid funding for Puerto Rico.\nNow, as Puerto Rico stands at the brink of running out of Medicaid funding, Hurricane Maria came to the island and wreaked havoc through its territory.\nAfter Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico faces significantly higher chances of a public health outbreak.\nAs Puerto Rico and the federal government begin the long and arduous task of putting the island back together again, it's vital that the U.S. government fully restores Medicaid funding for Puerto Rico.", 'date': None}, {'text': 'Thirteen days ago, Hurricane Maria trashed Puerto Rico, demolishing its already weak power, communications, and transportation infrastructure. The storm quickly gave way to a humanitarian crisis, with many of Puerto Rico’s residents struggling to access food, water, and fuel to run generators and cars. Help has been slow to arrive. And with each passing day, we’re learning more about the frightening conditions on the ground, from the sick being turned away from barely functioning hospitals to mothers desperate for water for their babies.\n\nBut for the past week, one figure was disquietingly absent: an accurate death toll.\n\nUntil Tuesday evening, when Gov. Ricardo Rossello updated it to 34, the official death count was stuck at 16. That prompted President Donald Trump to claim Tuesday on his visit to the island that it wasn’t a “real catastrophe” like Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, which had close to 2,000 deaths.\n\nYet there is good reason to believe the actual figure is much higher than 34, and will continue to climb.\n\nOmaya Sosa Pascual is a reporter with the Center for Investigative Journalism (CPI) in San Juan. She was skeptical of the government’s figure of 16 and began to call the 69 hospitals around the country, asking them about deaths related to the hurricane.\n\nPascual spoke to dozens of doctors, administrators, morgue directors, and funeral directors around the country, and wrote up her initial findings in a September 28 report in the Miami Herald. She then got Puerto Rico’s public safety secretary to confirm Monday that there have been dozens more deaths than the official statistic reflects. By her count, there are now an estimated 60 confirmed deaths linked to the hurricane and possibly hundreds more to come.\n\nSo why has the government been so slow to document the dead? Is this a cover-up, or just an administrative casualty of the all-encompassing crisis?\n\nThe biggest reason we’ve heard little about the fatalities\n\nOne part of the answer is simple: The situation is so chaotic that death certificates aren’t being signed, which means deaths aren’t being officially recorded.\n\n“Everything in the government has collapsed,” Pascual told me by phone from the parking lot of a San Juan medical center, one of the few places in the city where she said she could get a reliable cellphone signal. “Some of the people who work in the government lost their homes themselves and aren’t at work. So they can’t do death certificates. The dead can’t be documented because of all the logistics and legal aspects of declaring someone dead.”\n\nStill, she said, “not being able to document it doesn’t mean it’s not happening.”\n\nWhile officials in San Juan may not be receiving documents of the dead from municipalities that don’t have power or internet, Pascual thinks they could be doing more to gather the data and put out a more accurate update. She explains in her investigation that she was told “the dead are at the hospital morgues, which are at capacity and in remote places where the government has yet to go. In many cases, families are unaware of the deaths.”\n\nFor comparison, in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, Texas state and county officials provided reporters with an updated number of casualties directly related to the storm daily.\n\nTrump says it’s been “incredible ... the results that we\'ve had with respect to loss of life.” Those words might haunt him.\n\nOne problem with not updating the death count is that it can make the situation on the ground seem less dire than it actually is.\n\nOn Friday, President Trump took the 16 deaths as an opportunity to congratulate his administration for making “tremendous strides” in its response to the crisis.\n\n“The loss of life — it’s always tragic — but it’s been incredible the results that we’ve had with respect to loss of life,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “People can’t believe how successful that has been, relatively speaking.”\n\nThen on Tuesday, at press briefing in San Juan, he again pointed to the figure of 16 deaths to downplay the crisis on the island.\n\nevery death is a horror, but if you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina and you look at the tremendous hundreds and hundreds of people that died and what happened here with a storm that was just totally over-bearing. No one has ever seen anything like that … six people certified. Sixteen people versus in the thousands. You can be very proud of all of your people and all of our people working together. Sixteen versus literally thousands of people. You can be very proud.”\n\nIt’s clear that Trump’s response has been anything but successful (read Vox’s Matt Yglesias for more on that). For days, there were few workers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency or troops to help organize and distribute supplies. And most of the fuel delivered as part of the relief effort was stuck in San Juan because roads weren’t passable and truck drivers couldn’t get to work. That means that even the highest-priority facilities — namely, the island’s 69 hospitals — haven’t been able to operate at full capacity.\n\nBut there’s even more evidence that Trump’s words could come to haunt him.\n\nJohn Mutter, a disaster expert at Columbia University who studied the death toll in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, told Vox that he suspects the death toll in Puerto Rico from Maria will reach into the hundreds.\n\nOther experts agree: We’re going to have to wait a while for communications to be restored to find out how many are dead. “Sadly the island is so badly damaged that there is no ability to communicate — no way to know the number of people who may have been killed in the storm itself with houses coming down, debris," Stephen E. Flynn, the founding director of the Global Resilience Institute at Northeastern University, told Newsweek.\n\nOther news outlets have collected anecdotes of mounting deaths around the country that aren’t showing up in the official count. Los Angeles Times reporter Molly Hennessy-Fiske had this dispatch from a shelter in the Lajas region:\n\nAbout 100 people died in the three days after the storm in the Lajas region, twice the typical rate, according to a local funeral director. Eight elderly people have died in Lajas since the storm, at least one directly related to a shortage of medical supplies. “We don’t know if they didn’t have enough medicine, or oxygen — all of them were without electricity after the hurricane,” said funeral director Francisco Velez.\n\nAnd, tragically, as Carmen Yulín Cruz, mayor of Puerto Rico’s capital San Juan, asserted in an impassioned response to Trump, people may still be dying because the relief effort has been moving so slowly. “I am begging, begging anyone who can hear us to save us from dying,” she said. “If anybody out there is listening to us, we are dying, and you are killing us with the inefficiency.”', 'title': 'Puerto Rico finally updated the Hurricane Maria death toll to 34', 'url': 'https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/10/2/16392670/puerto-rico-death-toll-trump', 'keywords': ['updated', 'rico', 'told', 'hurricane', 'deaths', 'juan', 'trump', 'storm', 'maria', '34', 'dead', 'toll', 'puerto', 'death', 'san', 'finally'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Thirteen days ago, Hurricane Maria trashed Puerto Rico, demolishing its already weak power, communications, and transportation infrastructure.\nOmaya Sosa Pascual is a reporter with the Center for Investigative Journalism (CPI) in San Juan.\n“The loss of life — it’s always tragic — but it’s been incredible the results that we’ve had with respect to loss of life,” Trump told reporters at the White House.\nAnd most of the fuel delivered as part of the relief effort was stuck in San Juan because roads weren’t passable and truck drivers couldn’t get to work.\nJohn Mutter, a disaster expert at Columbia University who studied the death toll in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, told Vox that he suspects the death toll in Puerto Rico from Maria will reach into the hundreds.', 'date': 1506902400}, {'text': "Puerto Rico is America’s drug factory. Most major pharmaceutical companies have facilities there. This includes Bristol Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, and Wyeth. Hurricane Maria has nearly shut it down.\n\nFDA chief Dr. Scott Gottlieb has said that his agency is working to prevent shortages of 40 crucial drugs produced on the island. They include stroke-prevention and childhood leukemia drugs. The FDA has taken the unprecedented step of helping drug companies get fuel for emergency generators.\n\nPower outages aren’t the only problem that could affect production for months. Many employees can’t make it back to work. Transportation needed for raw materials and product shipping is crippled.\n\nInfrastructure is key to survival\n\nAfter hurricanes hit, our efforts tend to focus on emergency aid. This is understandable. But the most effective help for those who live in storm-prone areas is preparation.\n\nI’m not talking about hurricane “prep” like storing non-perishable food and bottled water. I’m talking about planning and investment in infrastructures hardened for natural disaster. But for that you need a fairly competent government.\n\nPuerto Rico, like pre-Katrina New Orleans, wasn’t prepared. Instead, politicians spent money on programs that would get them reelected. They put resources into lavish pensions for the politically powerful public employee unions.\n\nEven before Maria, the island was more than $70 billion in debt. Almost $50 billion of that debt is the unfunded portion of pension obligations to the growing retired population.\n\nThe biggest bill payer in Puerto Rico is pharma. It accounts for more than half the territory’s manufacturing and 25% of its GDP. The New York Times reports that the industry employs about 100,000 people. These workers make nearly three-quarters of the territory’s exports.\n\nDrug companies wanted improved infrastructure. Blackouts are a danger to an industry that needs low temperatures to produce goods. This was an issue even before Maria. Though the industry pays much of the island’s taxes, it lacked the political clout needed to get those changes.\n\nThe demographic disaster\n\nThe real clout belongs to the 200,000 government employees and many more retirees living on government pensions. Puerto Rico’s largest public pension, Employee Retirement System (ERS), supports almost 100,000 retirees.\n\nERS runs out of cash next year. It also owes more than $3 billion to bondholders who bought debt that was supposed to bail out the failing fund.\n\nThe other side of this demographic disaster is the shrinking population of young workers. As services and infrastructure deteriorated to pay for government retirees, the economy slowed.\n\nDesperate for opportunity, young families have fled. While the aged population increased, total population fell. The growing cost of the aged fell on a shrinking younger population.\n\nAs Megan McArdle points out in Bloomberg View, more Puerto Ricans were living in the US proper than on the island by 2008. Since then, the shift has continued. In 2014 alone, almost 3.5% of young Puerto Ricans left for the mainland.\n\nMcArdle’s article is aptly titled, “Debt Alone Won't Crush Puerto Rico. Depopulation Is the Curse.” Now, to escape dire post-hurricane conditions, hundreds of thousands more will join families in Florida and the Northeast. In fact, many will stay, returning only on vacations.\n\nPuerto Rico was already in an economic death spiral. Hurricane Maria adds energy to that vortex.\n\nPharmaceutical companies were attracted to Puerto Rico at first by tax incentives for US-based drug manufacturers. But those incentives expired long ago. Taxes are sure to go up as the island struggles to pay pensions it can’t afford and recover from the storm. At the same time, skilled tax-paying labor is shrinking due to out-migration.\n\nI don’t think that pharmaceutical production levels will be restored to pre-hurricane levels. This will further reduce tax revenues, making the pension crisis worse.\n\nAll of this was foreseeable. Much of this was preventable. It was no surprise that a big hurricane would hit Puerto Rico. We knew it was coming even if we didn’t know when it would arrive. We also knew that the island’s demographic and political problems would result in a pension crisis.\n\nPuerto Rico is not unique in this. It’s just ahead of the curve. Most American states are headed for the same demographic cliff. California, Illinois, New Jersey, and Kentucky are leading the charge.\n\nAs it happens, Hurricane Maria coincided with Puerto Rico’s demographic storm. It is ironic that it will almost certainly help kill (or at least cripple) pharmaceutical manufacturing.\n\nIt’s doubly ironic that the only solution for the demographic collapse must come from pharma. Specifically, the answer is anti-aging therapies that can keep older people productive and healthy for much longer.\n\nOn a personal note, I should mention that I wasted much of my life as a policy economist. Back then, I thought that government policies could be changed to prevent Social Security, Medicare, and pension crises.\n\nToday, those crises loom greater than ever but few seem to know or care. Any politician who tells voters that we must cut spending to prevent bankruptcy is denounced as uncompassionate.\n\nFor that reason, I don’t see a political solution to the demographic storm that is ravaging Puerto Rico. The scientific solution is within our grasp but few know that it exists or that we need it.\n\nDen Originalartikel gibt es auf RiskHedge.

Why? Because a month after the hurricane, even when supplies have been delivered to the island, the government has not managed to distribute it in remote places, or in some cases even communicate with them.\n\nAnd it’s not just remote places — it’s places like where my parents live, in Puerto Rico’s metropolitan area about 16 miles from San Juan. “The help is there … just sitting there” in San Juan, my parents told me in a shaky call. “Here in Toa Alta we haven’t seen any movement of aid.”\n\nMore: My homeland was destroyed. President Trump, Puerto Rico needs your help.\n\nMore: Donald Trump is news media's No. 1 salesman and threat\n\nAdding insult to injury, CBS News reporter David Begnaud highlighted a video of Puerto Rican Secretary of State Luis Rivera Marin standing in a dumpster with boxes of food and gallons of water. In the dumpster. With him. “Mishandled aid,” as he called it, in the southern town of Patillas.\n\n“I will tell you that everything that the president said that he was going to send to the island, it's getting there. The resources are there. The help is there,” Puerto Rico's delegate in Congress, Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon, said in an exclusive interview with me. Taking her at her word, the problem with recovery would then fall on emergency management workers at all levels, and the local government run by her 2016 ticket mate, Gov. Ricardo Rossello.\n\nCoincidentally, Rossello thanked artists, celebrities and private entities this week for their aid efforts on the island. And rightfully so, because private citizens have clearly shown to be more capable in helping fellow victims than the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Rossello’s team.\n\n“Duracell had trucks and they were going around distributing batteries to every single person they encountered. And the local church was canvassing in Orocovis (center of the island) handing out basic necessities,” my mother told me.\n\nA Real Housewives of New York star, Bethenny Frankel, was able to get dozens of planes with aid to remote places, transport people to hospitals and form coalitions with people she had never met before. Restaurateurs and chefs Jose Andres and Jose Enrique have been able to serve about 25,000 meals per day.\n\nThe reality is that a month after the storm, some 1 million Americans don't have running water. Even if you’re one of the lucky ones who has service, you’re still subject to a government advisory to boil the water before use due to contamination. Without power there are no electric pumps, so those living in apartment buildings still can’t get it. And how extensive is the outage at this point? About 3 million people still are without power on the 100x35-mile patch of land.\n\nThink about it. An island of only about 3,500 square miles has been without power for a month, some areas even longer due to Hurricane Irma.\n\nFor some context, in recent U.S. history the worst outage was in 2008, when the greater Houston area was ravaged by Hurricane Ike and about 2.5 million people were left without power for less than three weeks.\n\nAdmittedly, Puerto Rico faces different challenges than Houston did. Our infrastructure was neglected by almost every administration since power lines were hung, and the massive debt of the island tied the hands of the only state-run power company. Not to mention we’re an island. Surrounded by water. Big water.\n\nMore: Trump to hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico: We're not staying forever\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nAs subsequent rainfalls exacerbate the problems caused by hurricanes Irma and Maria, emergency responders have a responsibility to do the hard work and bring help where it’s needed, not just where it’s easy to get to or where the best photo-op is for President Trump or House Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\n“Aid is slowly being distributed, but not necessarily where it’s needed. Better logistics are needed,” says Beauchamp, who has been going house by house talking to people and assessing their needs.\n\nPuerto Ricans have always shown resilience, and we have always managed to get through tough times with smiles on our faces and relying on each other. It’s who we are. But we’re doing everything we can. It’s time our officials get their act together before the bodies keep piling up.\n\nThe federal government is not doing Puerto Rico a favor by helping the island recover; it’s a federal responsibility. Local government shouldn’t count on the kindness of private citizens for their plans; it should mobilize workers in the areas every Puerto Rican already knows are in most need. Finally, in order for a tragedy of this magnitude to not happen again, Puerto Rico’s infrastructure needs to be rebuilt in a modernized manner.\n\nIt’s incredible that a Real Housewife could deliver aid where governments, first responders and the military could not.\n\nJosh Rivera, USA TODAY's Your Say editor, was born and raised in Bayamon, Puerto Rico.

A pretty little town situated in the island’s southeastern Cayey mountain range, Aibonito has the highest altitude in Puerto Rico—twenty-four hundred feet. It’s known for its cool climate, its bucolic scenery, its flowers, and its chicken farms.\n\nIn the small valleys around the town, many of the long, low, tin-roofed chicken breederies—polleros—were smashed to smithereens, and their occupants killed, during Hurricane Maria. In the middle of last week, when I visited, the dead chickens had been buried, but there was still wreckage strewn around the blasted polleros. The eye of the storm came right through these hills on September 20th and was especially fierce along the exposed ridgelines. The winds, whipping in at a hundred and fifty-five miles an hour, ripped apart wooden houses; they also turned most of the leaves on the trees in the surrounding forests from green to brown. Along the road leading up to Aibonito from the capital city of San Juan, which is a two-hour drive, there is—as everywhere else on the island—a dismal panorama of ruined houses and businesses, toppled and twisted trees, and downed utility poles.\n\nI went to Aibonito in the company of a friend, Ana Teresa Toro. A talented journalist in her early thirties, Ana Teresa comes from Aibonito; she had always spoken proudly to me of her home town, and promised to show it to me one day. (She is also a newlywed; her wedding took place in the brief lull between Hurricanes Irma and Maria.)\n\nNow we had our chance. In Aibonito, Ana Teresa took me to meet her aunt and uncle, who live in the same house where her grandmother, a traditional healer, had lived and worked until her death, a few years ago. We walked to Aibonito’s central plaza to admire its unique red, white, and blue “mural de la bandera,” representing a detail of the Puerto Rican flag, which Ana Teresa’s cousin Humberto had painted, using an entire house as his canvas. The flag’s single illuminated star, which had stood on a stanchion on the rooftop, had been destroyed by Maria. Humberto had painted the mural as a patriotic gesture, and, as Ana Teresa pointed out, it was a pro-independence flag—its blue was the distinctive baby-blue of the independistas, whereas the Puerto Rican flags of those who are pro-statehood favor a darker hue.\n\nAfter Hurricane Maria, Ana Teresa and her husband, Modesto, didn’t go on a honeymoon but, instead, flew to Boston and sought assistance from the Puerto Rican community there. They had also met with mayors and businesspeople to solicit help for the island. Ana Teresa told me that she was happy to have helped make “a small contribution” to a fund-raising campaign, organized by several philanthropic organizations, that had raised about a million dollars for N.G.O.s involved in relief efforts on the island. But she had returned home, nonetheless, feeling extremely depressed. Looking around at the beat-up places of her Aibonito childhood, Ana Teresa also knew that, henceforth, things would probably not improve in Puerto Rico but get worse.\n\nLike most of the other Puerto Ricans I met, Ana Teresa was outraged and wounded by the things Donald Trump had said about Puerto Rico. She felt more deeply than ever that she and her fellow Puerto Ricans were second-class U.S. citizens. During her recent U.S. trip, she told me, one politician had come up to her and said, in a whisper that was intended to be confiding as well as comforting, “Don’t worry, we’re going to push for statehood for you.”\n\nFor Ana Teresa, a proud Puerto Rican nationalist, the remark was a crushing reminder that most non-Puerto Rican U.S. citizens are blissfully ignorant of the island’s cultural heritage, its history, and some of its people’s national aspirations. “I know that it didn’t occur to the mayor that he was hurting my feelings, nor did it occur to him that I might possibly aspire to anything higher than full U.S. citizenship,” Ana Teresa said. (Since 1917, when Puerto Rico was made an unincorporated U.S. territory, its citizens have been American citizens, but they do not have congressional voting rights, nor can they vote for President.)\n\nA view from Ramón Rivera’s property in Aibonito, Puerto Rico. The town is situated at an elevation of twenty-four hundred feet in the island’s southeastern Cayey mountain range. Photograph by Christopher Gregory for The New Yorker\n\nPuerto Rico’s neo-colonial status is shared with the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, which, along with Cuba and the Philippines, were the Spanish colonial possessions acquired by the United States after its military victory in the Spanish-American War. Both Cuba and the Philippines eventually became independent.\n\nAs it turns out, two of the last battles of the Spanish-American War in Puerto Rico took place just outside Aibonito on the bluff overlooking the island, at the edge of the Asomante hills. On August 9, 1898, a column of American troops probing into the central highlands met heavy resistance at Asomante from Spanish troops who were dug into the hilltop along a trench line. The U.S. troops were led by Major General James H. Wilson, a celebrated veteran of the American Civil War, on the Unionist side. (He was famous, among other things, for having captured the defeated Confederate President, Jefferson Davis.) Wilson’s troops retreated after coming under heavy fire; several American soldiers were wounded in the fracas. Three days later, his troops made another attempt to take the hilltop, and were again rebuffed, with several more men injured.\n\nThe war, such as it was, had already ended for the Spaniards, however. The next day, hostilities ceased when Spain agreed to surrender its forces and to relinquish Puerto Rico and its other colonial territories. A month later, on September 13, 1898, in the Protocol of Peace, as it was called, Spain formalized its defeat by a vote of 161 to 48 in the Spanish parliament, the Cortes. While Spain entered the twentieth century as a defeated nation on the world stage, the United States launched itself forth with swagger as a new and expansionist military player.\n\nAs for Puerto Rico, the U.S. victory over Spain meant a new form of political vassalage. Like neighboring Cuba, Puerto Rico had also had a pro-independence movement and launched several short-lived revolts that had been quelled by the Spaniards. Instead of receiving its emancipation, however, from 1898 onward Puerto Rico became a virtual American colony, under the authority of the U.S. military, which also appointed Puerto Rico’s governor. In 1914, the U.S. Congress rejected a unanimous vote made by the rump Puerto Rican legislature in favor of Puerto Rico’s independence. In 1917, by another act of Congress, Puerto Rico was made an unincorporated U.S. territory.', 'title': 'Hurricane Maria and Puerto Rico’s Neo-Colonial Legacy', 'url': 'https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hurricane-maria-and-puerto-ricos-neo-colonial-legacy', 'keywords': ['rico', 'hurricane', 'ana', 'town', 'war', 'american', 'aibonito', 'neocolonial', 'troops', 'maria', 'teresa', 'puerto', 'rican', 'legacy', 'ricos'], 'tags': {'Photography', 'FEMA', 'Donald Trump', 'Hurricane Maria', 'Natural Disasters', 'Puerto Rico'}, 'summary': 'After Hurricane Maria, Ana Teresa and her husband, Modesto, didn’t go on a honeymoon but, instead, flew to Boston and sought assistance from the Puerto Rican community there.\nLike most of the other Puerto Ricans I met, Ana Teresa was outraged and wounded by the things Donald Trump had said about Puerto Rico.\nAs for Puerto Rico, the U.S. victory over Spain meant a new form of political vassalage.\nLike neighboring Cuba, Puerto Rico had also had a pro-independence movement and launched several short-lived revolts that had been quelled by the Spaniards.\nIn 1914, the U.S. Congress rejected a unanimous vote made by the rump Puerto Rican legislature in favor of Puerto Rico’s independence.', 'date': None}, {'text': "Mark Davis of the US Fish & Wildlife Service has been in Puerto Rico for about a week as part of the agency's disaster response efforts.

There is no shortage of trucks or drivers.\n\nSAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — The Auxilio Mutuo Hospital here can’t figure out how to get specialized medical supplies from the nearby airport. A Puerto Rican in Tampa found the quickest way to deliver help to her hometown was to do it in person. And shipping containers filled with emergency goods are piling up at the Port of San Juan.\n\nNearly three weeks after Hurricane Maria devastated this U.S. territory in the Caribbean, individuals and charities on the U.S. mainland trying to send supplies to the island are facing a series of bottlenecks that are keeping help from reaching those most in need.\n\nThe barriers range from a lack of communication to blocked roads.\n\nAs a result, one Port of San Juan terminal is storing 3,400 containers — more than double the usual number, said Jose “Pache” Ayala, vice president and general manager for Puerto Rico at Crowley Maritime Corp.\n\nBecause of tangled power lines across roads, washed out bridges and highways and knocked out cellphone towers and radio antennas across the island, materials are leaving the Crowley terminal gate at 70% the normal rate before the storm, Ayala said.\n\nThe backlog affects goods and equipment from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, such as food and bottled water, bucket trucks, front-end loaders and 275,000 gallons of diesel and 75,000 gallons of gasoline.\n\n“That relief cargo has priority,” Ayala said. It also affects commercial cargo such as building materials and medications that are also in great demand, he said.\n\n“It’s easier to help internationally than it is in Puerto Rico,” said Neil Frame with Operation USA in Los Angeles. The non-profit, which ships donated medical supplies into disaster areas around the world, has not yet found a way to deliver goods onto the U.S. territory.\n\n\n\nHis group is currently shipping supplies to Mexico after the earthquake and also helping in Texas after Hurricane Harvey, but there it was easy — workers just drove down and found people who could help distribute.\n\n\n\nBecause of lingering poor communications since Maria struck here Sept. 20, his group has only been able to connect with eight of about 60 hospitals on the island. “You know that the ones that really need it are the ones we haven’t been able to talk to,” he said.\n\nStill, he has neonatal equipment that one hospital is waiting for and is planning to ship pharmaceuticals that have a shelf life, so they will not last if they wait in port.\n\nCommunications are still spotty and a major impediment for shippers and truckers.\n\n“There are some packages sent by family to someone in Puerto Rico that because communications are so bad the person here doesn’t know (it\'s coming)," Ayala said.\n\nTrucker Ricardo Carbonell, 42, said damaged roads, downed trees and low-hanging power lines form another obstacle to get goods to those in need. And his company won’t deliver if dispatchers can’t get ahold of the recipient in advance.\n\n“If there’s no communications, they call and call, nobody answers the phone, and we don’t bring them anything,” he said.\n\nAnother trucker, José Vasquez, 46, of Toa Baja, described how he took a container last week from San Juan to Rio Piedra, unloaded it and brought the empty container back to Crowley. Usually he’d reload immediately, but since Maria knocked out the radio antennas between San Juan and his home base, he had to drive an hour to Toa Baja to get an order for his next load.\n\nNormally, “I’d be gone in 10 minutes,” he said. “Now I have to go there, one hour, and come back, another hour, to get another load out.”\n\nAt Auxilio Mutuo Hospital, the only facility currently performing heart surgery on the island, administrators are having difficulty getting the specialized supplies needed for transplant patients.\n\n“The issue is how do we get it from the airport to here,” said Carlos Méndez, associate administrator at Auxilio Mutuo. “We cannot communicate with anyone at the airport.”\n\nMichael Fernandez, executive director at CARAS de las Americas, said some shipments languish for more than a week until the usual import tax is lifted for the emergency aid. And even now, “shipments are flowing, and a lot of non-profits are up and running, but that doesn’t mean aid coming from the government is actually getting there,” Fernandez said.\n\nLiza Minnelli Pacheco, 43, a native of Guayanilla who now lives in Tampa, said Puerto Ricans want to send goods to relatives but don’t know what to send or how to arrange for the items to be picked up or delivered.\n\nShe and her friends in Florida from Guayanilla scrimped to raise money to deliver the aid in person. She traveled to her hometown on the hard-hit southern coast of Puerto Rico with a cooler full of insulin, some of which she gave to a city worker for a resident who had run out of her medicine.\n\n“If a family in the U.S. wants to send things, it’s difficult,” Minnelli Pacheco said.\n\nContributing: Carrie Cochran\n\nMore: Puerto Rico\'s farmers face near total loss from Hurricane Maria\n\nCould Puerto Rico go solar?

Hurricane Maria moves away from North Carolina coast\n\nWAVES, N.C. — Maria regained strength and became a hurricane again Wednesday, pushing water over both sides of North Carolina’s Outer Banks and taking its time to slowly turn away from the U.S. Atlantic coast.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said at 8 p.m. that the storm continues to head away from the Carolina coast.\n\nNo injuries have been reported, but a surge of ocean water washed over eroded beaches, flooding properties and state Highway 12, the only road through the narrow barrier islands of Hatteras and Ocracoke.\n\nNo ferries were moving, cutting off access to Ocracoke, and with parts of the highway flooded even at low tide, any travel on Hatteras remains hazardous, Dare County Emergency Management Director Drew Pearson said in an email. He said the worst problems were on Hatteras Island, where more than 10,000 visitors left under an evacuation order, but hundreds of local residents were allowed to stay.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft measured Maria’s top sustained winds at 75 mph, with higher gusts. Its center was about 250 miles off Cape Hatteras at 8 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nWhile Maria’s most punishing hurricane-force winds remained offshore, tropical storm-force winds extended for as much as 230 miles from the center, churning up the surf on both sides of the islands. The hurricane’s forward speed is just 6 mph so the storm was lingering before swinging out to sea.\n\nOn Hatteras, a fine rain fell Wednesday, and patches of blue sky occasionally shown through. Police set up a checkpoint to block all traffic except for residents and reporters.\n\nAs the winds picked up, waves crashed up to and beyond ocean-front homes between the communities of Rodanthe and Avon.\n\nMore: Why Puerto Rico is being denied shipping deliveries of fuel\n\nMore: After Maria, hurricane-weary U.S. will get a breather\n\nMore: 'People are starting to die': Distribution chaos snarls effort to aid desperate Puerto Ricans\n\nMore: Hurricane Maria: How you can help storm victims\n\n“Mother Nature keeps chopping at it,” said Tony Meekins, 55, a lifelong resident of Avon who works as an engineer on the temporarily halted Hatteras-Ocracoke ferry. “We see storm after storm.”\n\nStanding near Avon’s closed fishing pier, Meekins pointed to where the dune line is gone, pounded down by previous storms. At low tide, a layer of wet sand covered the road.\n\nChip Stevens owns Blackbeard’s Lodge, a 38-unit hotel on Ocracoke. He hopes the highway remains passable on both islands to enable the people and supplies that arrive by ferry to move up and down the island.\n\nThis weather is only the latest tropical blow to the Outer Banks, among the most fragile islands in the continental United States. Officials warned that the surge of ocean water and waves would overwhelm sand dunes from both the ocean and from Pamlico Sound, which separates the islands from the mainland. Bulldozers were in place to push the sand off Highway 12 when water subsides.\n\nMaria is predicted to erode more than half the dunes along North Carolina’s 300-mile coast. Beaches in Maryland and Virginia could fare even worse, with two-thirds seeing erosion and the ocean washing over the dunes on one-third of them, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nAll that salt water “is like throwing battery acid on your car,” said Carrington Erhardt, who worries about driving to the homes she cleans. “That’s the biggest thing, is that it destroys the vehicles.”\n\nBrent and Donna Bennett, of Buxton, worry about lost wages.

Now, its climate vulnerability threatens the world's medical supplies.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration is monitoring about 30 critical pharmaceuticals manufactured either solely or primarily on Puerto Rico — including 14 that cannot be substituted by anything else on the market, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb told a congressional panel yesterday. The outlook is also risky for manufacturers of 50 critical medical devices, like insulin pumps and pacemakers.\n\nNearly a month after Hurricane Maria wiped out Puerto Rico's rickety electrical grid, emergency responders are still struggling to treat the immediate health needs of people on the island. Dialysis treatments are cut short, routine lab tests have to be outsourced to the mainland and lawmakers cited a picture of surgeons operating by cellphone light.\n\nThe damage to sophisticated medical manufacturing firms, though, could prove just as devastating to Puerto Ricans and the world at large. The sector comprises at least one-third of the territory's gross domestic product. The firms are major employers. Most facilities are barely operating, and it's causing or exacerbating shortages in the United States and elsewhere.\n\nAbout 8 percent of the medicines Americans take comes from Puerto Rico, based on dollar value, Gottlieb said.\n\nCorporations in sectors like agriculture, mining and energy are already preparing for climate change to shock supply chains, according to a 2013 report from PwC.\n\nThe pharmaceutical sector is particularly vulnerable to those disruptions, given then small number of suppliers for each product. Extreme weather fueled by climate change promises to compound that vulnerability, researchers from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research wrote in a 2014 commentary for the journal Nature.\n\nIn the wake of Maria, FDA has already scrambled to source alternatives for an IV solution and antibiotic produced in Puerto Rico by Baxter International.\n\nThe United States is now importing those products from Australia and Ireland, Gottlieb said.\n\nA few medical manufacturing facilities are running on generators. But generators aren't designed to run for months at a time, and most of the facilities cannot get back to full operations until the utility restores the electric grid, Gottlieb said.\n\n“If we get into the first quarter of the next year and these facilities aren't back on the grid, we're going to have some concerns,” he said, adding that the Army Corps of Engineers is prioritizing restoring power to particularly critical sites.\n\nBut it's a daunting task. Only 60 percent of the territory's hospitals have been connected to the grid, and even those are keeping their generators close, said Robert Kadlec, assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nMedical device manufacturers need reliable electricity and a lot of it, Gottlieb said, so some firms might not transition from their generators even after the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority comes back online.\n\nRep. Diana DeGette, a Colorado Democrat, said the medical device manufacturer Medtronic has already notified her daughter that they cannot deliver her a new insulin pump because of Puerto Rico's crisis.\n\nIf even one medical company leaves Puerto Rico, it could be a “fatal” blow to the territory's economy, said Jenniffer González-Colón (R), Puerto Rico's representative in Congress.\n\nHouse rules barred González-Colón from asking questions during yesterday's hearing.

I can\'t hear very well. It\'s too hard for me to try to go find another place so I am here waiting for my sister to find me," said Efrain Diaz Figueroa, 70, who sleeps under a shard of tin on a damp mattress in the wreckage of his sister\'s home, batting away swarms of mosquitoes in the punishing heat. A sign nearby reads: "Don\'t rob us."\n\nPuerto Rico has some of the highest income inequality in the world, said Jose Caraballo, president of Puerto Rico Economists Association. More than 40 percent of the island lives below the poverty line, and tens of thousands are now out of work. Life for them is only getting worse.\n\n"Maria just exacerbated the inequalities we were seeing in Puerto Rico, especially among those in the metropolitan area and those in the country," he said.\n\nThe U.S. territory of 3.4 million people was already struggling with a more than decade-long recession before the storm, working to restructure a portion of its $73 billion public debt. The median annual income is $19,500, while in the rest of the U.S. it\'s more than $58,000.\n\nThe line between poverty and the middle class was already blurring. More than a dozen families a day were losing homes to foreclosure. Unemployment was at 10 percent, nearly three times the rate in the mainland.\n\n"And then Maria happened. And now those people are living like the homeless. They don\'t have a roof, they don\'t have water, they are caring about more basic things such as food," Caraballo said.\n\nThe Category 4 storm was among the most devastating the U.S. territory has ever seen, killing more than 50 people. It ripped up giant trees, wiped out power to the entire island, demolished scores of homes and badly damaged thousands more. About 70 percent of people now have water, but still must boil it or treat it to make it safe to drink. Governor Ricardo Rossello has pledged to get 95 percent of power back by Dec. 31; right now, about 30 percent have electricity.\n\nPost-storm life\n\nSome parts of the island feel practically normal: In upscale parts of San Juan, organic markets are stocked with cold, fresh produce and water, though some still limit the number of bottles you can buy. Generators whir outside restaurants and apartment buildings. Lights flicker on in the evenings among the high-rises. People walk their dogs on cleared streets, jog wearing expensive gym clothes in the early morning and go out for dinner in partially lit restaurants.\n\n"We\'re doing OK, all things considered," said Jesus Gonzalez, 43. Like many, the generator in his building runs during the evening, the cost of which is split among the tenants. They have access to laundry machines, so he doesn\'t mind sweating at the gym.\n\nWhen the generators broke at the home of Dr. Linette Perez in the upscale suburb of Guaynabo, she and her husband and son went to a luxury hotel for three days to get some relief. Her home suffered minor damage; her beach house was worse. The family is thinking of leaving for the states, like tens of thousands of others already have.\n\n"The generator exploded because we used it so much," she said as her 7-year-old, Gustavo, swam in a clear, cold pool. "We couldn\'t get another right away big enough for the house so we came to relax."\n\nBut life is increasingly desperate for others, especially outside of the city where it\'s been more difficult for aid workers to reach families cut off by fallen bridges and mudslides. Hours are longer because they are washing clothes by hand, hunting for food and water, and spending any free time cleaning up the wreckage of their homes.\n\nNear Vega Baja, a mountain town about 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of San Juan, 63-year-old Dolores Gonzales still spends hours every day looking for water, driving along a treacherous stretch of mountain road obscured by downed trees and giant power poles. She\'s collected rainwater, and uses nearby stream water for washing clothes, but she fears it.\n\n"The close water is full of dead animals and debris," she said. "I\'m scared to use it to bathe. I don\'t want an infection."\n\nHer grandson Emanuel Ramos has been out of work since the storm, and his family of four small children is staying with her in their leaky, moldy home.\n\n"It\'s impossible to find work right now. We\'re living in the dark ages out here," said Ramos, 27.\n\nMaking ends meet\n\nThe government is the island\'s biggest employer, while other major jobs are in manufacturing, primarily in pharmaceuticals, textiles and electronics. But modern business depends on power and communication networks.\n\nIn Caguas, businessman Ricky Canto has no power or potable water, and family members are staying at his home. But the 54-year-old has a portable distillery that cleans water from his pool and a massive generator that costs him upward of $500 a week. Canto, who drives a $250,000 silver Ferrari, can afford it. But he knows his workers can\'t.\n\n"We have to get the systems up and running soon," he said. "People need to work."\n\nSome like Moises Valentin, 63, have been recycling cans to make ends meet, picking through mountains of stinking, rotten trash. He had so much damage to his roof that his small apartment was ruined. He wept as he stood among his destroyed belongings, piled high, as members of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built him a temporary roof.\n\n"I did not feel poor until after Maria," he said.', 'title': 'Hurricane Maria Recovery Highlights Puerto Rico Inequalities', 'url': 'https://www.voanews.com/a/hurricane-maria-recovery-highlights-puerto-rico-inequalities/4085956.html', 'keywords': ['rico', 'island', 'right', 'hurricane', 'power', 'thousands', 'inequalities', 'storm', 'recovery', 'maria', 'work', 'puerto', 'water', 'dont', 'highlights'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Hurricane Maria didn\'t discriminate between rich and poor when it ravaged Puerto Rico, but the recovery has been another story.\nPuerto Rico has some of the highest income inequality in the world, said Jose Caraballo, president of Puerto Rico Economists Association.\n"Maria just exacerbated the inequalities we were seeing in Puerto Rico, especially among those in the metropolitan area and those in the country," he said.\nThey don\'t have a roof, they don\'t have water, they are caring about more basic things such as food," Caraballo said.\n"It\'s impossible to find work right now.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'Please enable cookies on your web browser in order to continue.\n\nThe new European data protection law requires us to inform you of the following before you use our website:\n\nWe use cookies and other technologies to customize your experience, perform analytics and deliver personalized advertising on our sites, apps and newsletters and across the Internet based on your interests.

But in this occasion, we had the worst natural disaster in 100 years on the island.”\n\nFlores Ortega estimated the island lost 80% of its crops. The poultry sector lost 90% of its production and more than 2 million of its 2.6 million birds, along with numerous chicken coops and processing equipment.\n\nAll the plantations have been destroyed. Flooding covered 51,000 acres of coastal area. Cows and other livestock floated away in the swollen rivers. Irrigation systems were lost, and ornamental and hydroponic facilities were damaged.\n\n“There’s no plant that can survive 150-mph winds,” Flores Ortega said.\n\nFederal agencies and the island’s Department of Agriculture are looking for ways to restore Puerto Rico’s $1 billion agricultural sector, with grants and loans to help bury animals and to rebuild facilities and roads so farmers can go back to planting and production.\n\nJobs and income produced by food processors add another $3.5 billion to the island’s economy, Flores Ortega said.\n\nLuz Quiñones, 39, who owns La Cosecha Mia (My Harvest) produce market in Old San Juan, said Puerto Rico’s farm industry was undergoing a renaissance before the hurricane, with young people getting into the game to feed a demand for organic and local produce.\n\nThat sector has grown to the point it started to export produce, Quiñones said.\n\n“If the government doesn’t help rebuild, I don’t know if we’re going to survive,” she said.\n\nIn Yabucoa, a region on the southeastern corner of the island that produces plantains, farmer Aurelio Beltran drove through acres of downed plantain trees.\n\nAngel Morales, president of the Yabucoa farming cooperative, said most of the valley\'s 3,000 to 4,000 acres of plantains were destroyed. Although farmers carry insurance, they\'ll still lose money because trees cost $6 to $7 to plant, and insurance only pays $3.25 a tree, Morales said.\n\nRoig, whose forefathers established his farm in 1876 as Spanish immigrants from Catalonia, rode across his land in a rusty Jeep Renegade with his son, Jesús, 31, at the wheel.\n\nHe handed farmhand Ilaín Armánd, several meal packages from the Federal Emergency Management Agency that had been distributed by the Puerto Rico National Guard to the municipality of Guayanilla, which brought them to Roig. Armánd, 35, moved his wife and three small children to a friend’s house after his home was wrecked in the storm.\n\nRoig estimated that 3,500 pounds of coffee beans were lost when Maria raked his plants, as well as 100,000 young plants in his now-devastated nursery. Five of his eight houses for farmworkers were destroyed.\n\nA municipal road crew passed by after clearing the road to the last isolated farm and a family of five who rode out the storm near the mountaintop.\n\nWhat’s Roig going to do now? “We’re going to work,” he answered.\n\n“Some of the plants will dry in the field without shade, but not all,” Roig said. “Most of it will survive, what’s still there.”\n\nIn a month or two, inspectors will come to examine the damage for an insurance claim, he said.\n\nJesús Roig drove the Jeep to a compound of homes to check on neighbors. He exchanged hugs with Sylvia Santiago, 77, who said her son was out looking for water. Nearby, a horse grazed and came close to see the visitors, an injured dog lay on his side and panted in the heat, while chickens pecked at the ground.\n\nFarther up the mountain, the elder Roig stooped to inspect a coffee plant. When he rubbed the yellow spots on the leaves, they turned to a reddish powder that wafted in the mountain breeze. The fungus, called roya, “was here before, but the storm weakened the plants. The disease is now spreading faster," he said.\n\nIn the distance, visible against a backdrop of hazy mountain peaks, small leaves and bright red-orange flowers sprouted on some of the bare tree branches.\n\n“This will be green before Christmas,” he said.\n\nContributing: Carrie Cochran in Yabucoa\n\nMore: Puerto Rico health system on life support two weeks after Hurricane Maria\n\nMore: Puerto Ricans say Trump\'s visit helps recovery but comments are too political\n\nMore: "Wipe out" Puerto Rico debt?

He tossed rolls of paper towels to the crowd in San Juan and compared the island’s lower death toll with the “real catastrophe” of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when more than 1,800 people died.\n\nPence, for his part, said there had been “steady progress” on opening roads and addressing other challenges, but acknowledged, “we have a long way to go.” He told Puerto Ricans he had “faith in President Trump’s leadership, his determination to stand by Puerto Rico in this challenging time.”\n\nThe vice president joined with religious leaders at the Iglesia Santa Bernardita church in San Juan, which has fed about 60 to 100 people every day since the storm. Pence carried a tray of sandwiches into the church’s reception area and then walked along the long white tables, shaking hands.\n\nDuring a church service, Pence listened as Father Willie Pena spoke of the resiliency of the people, explaining that he tells those who talk about still being in the dark, “We do not have electricity but we do have light.”\n\nThe vice president offered an upbeat message, predicting that one day the congregation would say, “Puerto Rico se levanta, Puerto Rico is rising.” He then bowed his head as his wife, Karen, led the church in prayer. They later met with emergency responders.\n\nVice President Mike Pence, joined by his wife Karen Pence, fourth from left, surveys hurricane damage outside Holy Cross Episcopal Church in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands on Friday, Oct. 6, 2017.

Church leaders vowed to rebuild as sunlight streamed onto the pews from above and water and dirt lined the church’s white tile floor.\n\nSitting in the back of the church, Jose Sanchez, a 33-year-old construction worker, said Pence’s visit “builds morale. It gives us hope.”\n\nAs for Maria, Sanchez said: “It was a whipping that we received. It is something that people are never going to forget, like Katrina.”\n\nPence then boarded a military helicopter to view the damage from the air, looking on as his convoy flew over St. Croix, St. Thomas and St. John _ now marked by upended boats lying along the coastline, blue tarps dotting the tops of homes and vegetation ripped astray.\n\nPence described the wreckage as “overwhelming,” but told local leaders, “the resilience of the people of the U.S. Virgin Islands is even greater.”\n\nTrump had hoped to visit the U.S. Virgin Islands earlier in the week but the White House said difficult logistics in the aftermath of the storm prevented it from adding it to his trip to Puerto Rico.\n\nThere were few complaints.

I thought it would withstand it. But it didn\'t - down it went."\n\nHe now spends most of his days looking for clean water and milk for his two-month-old baby Jocelyn. Eight weeks after Hurricane Maria, Jose and his family are among the millions of Puerto Ricans still reeling from the storm and its aftermath.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Two months after Hurricane Maria, many Puerto Ricans are still without vital infrastructure.\n\nIt\'s hard to believe that this is a United States territory, that these people are American citizens. Many on the US mainland aren\'t even aware of the legal responsibility that the US government - which is in charge of Puerto Rico - has towards Puerto Ricans.\n\nPresident Donald Trump was criticised for treating the island differently to other disaster zones on the mainland. He arrived in Puerto Rico a full two weeks after the hurricane, and at one event, threw paper towels at crowds who were without food, water, or electricity.\n\nAs those images were broadcast on television screens and streamed online, frustration turned to anger.\n\nThe more people I spoke to, the more I realised that many on the island feel that they are not part of the US and that they\'re treated like second-class citizens.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption President Trump was criticised for throwing paper towels intro a crowd during his visit\n\nChief among these is Carmen Yulin Cruz, the mayor of Puerto Rico\'s capital, San Juan. Soon after Maria struck the island, she entered a Twitter war with Mr Trump about what she regarded as his weak response to the crisis. President Trump described the mayor as "nasty" and alleged the island was broken long before the hurricane.\n\nWhen I asked her if he was wrong to suggest Puerto Rico had existing issues, she told me: "What is incorrect is for a president who is supposed to be the commander-in-chief to become the hater-in-chief and to become the person who just tweets away their hate. That\'s what\'s incorrect."\n\nUltimately, how Puerto Ricans on the island feel about President Trump makes very little difference to whether he stays in office. They can\'t vote in presidential elections, since the territory has no votes in the electoral college.\n\nBut tens of thousands have already fled to the mainland following the devastation caused by the hurricane. There of course, they do have a say.\n\nFor the majority of the three-and-a-half million Puerto Ricans in the territory, it feels as though time has stopped. Rotting debris can be seen outside almost every property, as though the hurricane had only just happened.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption San Juan\'s Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz has been involved in a Twitter war"with President Trump\n\nThere are concerns that the piles of rubbish could lead to a public health crisis. This island may belong to the most powerful country in the world but its citizens lack even the most basic of things.\n\nAll across the island, I spot dozens of people: men, women and children collecting water from open springs and from the sides of the mountains. The authorities have warned against using the water for drinking purposes, saying it may be contaminated.\n\nSome are profiting from this scarcity. I spoke to one man who said he knows of people who are exploiting the elderly and the disabled by selling them gallons of potentially contaminated water collected from these points.\n\nAll this has led to deaths linked to lack of clean water. The official death toll is 55 but that\'s just people whose deaths have been verified by autopsy. The mayor of San Juan says it could be as high as 500. Cases of leptospirosis, a deadly bacterial disease often transmitted through contaminated water, have shot up since the hurricane.\n\nImage caption Two months after the hurricane, many people on the island are still struggling to find water\n\nSo what is America doing to help? The Puerto Ricans I spoke to say not enough. They tell me they have felt neglected by the United States for decades, and now the island is in a deep financial crisis.\n\nFor most of the 20th Century, American companies which moved to the territory received significant tax breaks. They created jobs and became part of the island\'s fabric. Ten years ago, these incentives came to an end, and big corporations fled, taking with them hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n\nMass unemployment, mixed with decades of excessive borrowing by the local government, meant Puerto Rico was facing bankruptcy even before Maria hit. The island now owes Wall Street more than $72bn (£55bn).\n\nThe electricity grid was in such a bad shape that hundreds of thousands of people faced frequent blackouts. Many people didn\'t have access to clean running water. The hurricane has further exposed the difficulties that this island faces.\n\nImage caption The island\'s electricity grid remains extensively damaged\n\nThis is a catastrophe that has impacted everyone. Even the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), Alejandro De La Campa, who is tasked with providing relief and aid, told me he has no power.\n\n"This is the largest Fema response in the Caribbean, the most catastrophic event in Puerto Rico and probably in the US," he says.\n\nHe pushes back when I question him about the criticism directed at Fema for not reacting quickly enough to the needs of Puerto Ricans, saying he and his team remain committed.\n\nMany residents across this island told me they had almost resigned themselves to the fact that they may be without electricity for up to a year.

That figure is at least 70 times greater than the official death count of 64.\n\nThe news comes as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ends its contract to rebuild Puerto Rico’s power lines, which were almost entirely destroyed by the Category 5 storm. Puerto Rico says 99 percent of the island is back on the electrical grid, but more than 13,000 Puerto Ricans remain without power, according to CNN. Earlier this month, the Federal Emergency Management Agency announced that the island’s state-owned power authority, PREPA, will oversee the remaining work on the electrical infrastructure.\n\nFEMA also announced last week it had awarded more than $194 million in public assistance grants to Puerto Rico for recovery efforts related to last year’s devastating storm. To date, the agency says it has awarded about $2.2 billion in total funding to the island for debris removal and emergency protective measures.\n\nDespite relief efforts associated with Hurricane Maria, Puerto Ricans told The New York Times that they’re now worried about the upcoming hurricane season, which starts in June. A crucial concern is whether Puerto Rico’s power grid can withstand even a minor storm, the Times reported. Sarah Varney of Kaiser Health News told the PBS NewsHour that locals remain skittish about the power grid’s frailty. Last month, two island-wide blackouts knocked out power to 840,000 people.

Fema has gone back to paper and pencil in Puerto Rico to remedy this, but residents said the first federal representative only showed up in Utuado last week, 42 days after Maria.\n\nBefore Fema arrived, Nereida Montero traveled several hours to another town to get in touch with her daughter-in-law in Michigan to fill out the online form. She’s still unsure when Fema will show up to inspect her house to approve the assistance money. And she has another common problem in that she’s not sure how the agency will contact her either, given her complete lack of communications.\n\nMaybe they’ll send a letter to her ruined house. For now, she’s living with her ex-husband, surviving on crackers and cookies supplied by the church.\n\nIn several different towns, people reported that Fema staff often did not speak Spanish, either in person or during long waits on the phone. Federal employees sent to the island have struggled in the mountains, often getting lost and asking for directions or left stymied by impassable roads. A key bridge near Utuado completely collapsed, prompting residents to erect a rudimentary zip line in order to receive food and water over the muddy river.\n\nFema would be forgiven for feeling a little punch-drunk. For the first time in 166 years of records two category four hurricanes made landfall on the continental US in the same season, with Harvey dumping 25 trillion gallons of water in just a few days in Texas, followed by Irma ripping up the spine of Florida.\n\nThen came Maria on 20 September, pummeling Puerto Rico with winds of up to 154mph and damaging or wiping out 230,000 homes. The whole island was left without power and the the lack of drinkable water drove some people to rip the seals off wells that were condemned due to toxic pollution.\n\nThe Guardian asked Fema if its response to Maria has been slow or unwieldy, prompting the agency to forcefully reject the suggestion.\n\n“Are you aware of Harvey? Of Irma? Are you aware of the wildfires in California? To cover this story properly you have to get that right,” a Fema spokesman told the Guardian.\n\n“It’s been a challenging time. It’s an island surrounded by water 1,000 miles from Florida. We’ve moved as quick as we can. You seem stuck on slow. It’s not slow.”\n\nFema has extended the deadline for disaster relief to 120 days, easing a looming deadline for applications that was previously due on 20 November. The agency said it has registered more than 1 million people for assistance, approving $125m in payments so far.\n\nIt insists it has a presence in each of Puerto Rico’s 78 municipalities and those like Utuado that were hard to reach have received helicopter-borne supply drops. Local people have been hired to help deal with Spanish speakers on the phone, although the inspections are largely done by contractors.\n\n“Many places are still not accessible, but we are finding creative and innovative ways to reach people,” said the Fema spokesman. “People are staying with relatives, or in hotels, so we reach out by email or through family members. It might take a bit longer.”\n\nGovernment bureaucracy has sometimes jarred with traditional practices in places like Utuado, which is surrounded by peaks covered in the broken bones of flattened trees. Like many agriculture-based communities – coffee is grown in the hills here – land is often divided up informally within families. Applications for aid that demand deeds and other property verification are met with puzzlement. An emergency legal aid fund has been set up to bridge the gap.\n\n“The people who come from the US don’t know our idiosyncrasies, or even our rights or our laws,” said Carmen Villaneuva Castro, a community leader in San Juan who has led efforts to provide aid to those outside the metropolis. “Sometimes they don’t know words in Spanish. It’s like they don’t know our reality.”\n\nElectricity output is still 40% below normal levels and around 20% of Puerto Ricans still don’t have water. The total number of deaths is less clear – the official tally stands at about 55 but Carmin Yulín Cruz, the mayor of San Juan, has said the actual total is much higher, most likely in the hundreds.\n\nMeanwhile, San Juan is staggering back towards normalcy – vegetation is now on the previously bare trees, the lines at gas stations have dissipated and mobile phone coverage is creeping back. But the recovery is much slower in rural areas and there’s hefty cynicism aimed at both Fema – “Fema es el problema” is stamped into bollards along several main streets – and at the debt-ridden Puerto Rican government and municipalities that are supposed to direct the aid that Fema provides.\n\n“It’s been 43 days and it should be getting better, but it’s not,” said Yulixa Paredes, another Utuado resident who hasn’t been to work since 4ft of water was introduced to her office. “People are getting desperate now.

That’s on top of a similar-size exodus over the last decade of economic crisis, creating a massive population loss for the U.S. territory of 3.4 million.\n\nMost of those who have left went on their own. Aid groups and the U.S. government helped evacuate large numbers of the elderly and sick. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it has offered to help relocate those still in temporary shelters, about 2,400 people as of Friday, to temporary housing on the mainland.\n\nMany of those leaving are facing recriminations from fellow Puerto Ricans who accuse them of abandoning their homeland when it needs them the most.\n\nNilsa Montes, an unemployed waitress, said her friends and family often talk negatively about those who have left.\n\n“They always get criticized because people point out, ‘Hey, you didn’t stay,’” she said. “I wouldn’t move because I don’t give up.”\n\nThe drive to stay in Puerto Rico and help rebuild has become a sociocultural movement with its own slogan echoing Montes: “Yo no me quito,” or “I’m not giving up.”\n\nThose four words have become a popular hashtag posted next to pictures on social media of Puerto Ricans rebuilding homes, distributing food and water or simply relaxing on the beach. Some who left or are leaving respond with messages that they would stay if someone found them a job, power or water.\n\nMore: Google parent's Project Loon delivers Internet to 100,000 in Puerto Rico\n\nRelated: Maria's smallest victims: In Puerto Rico, children's mental health a growing concern\n\nThe “yo no me quito” message carries so much meaning that when Denise Centeno, who runs the Hispanic Family Counseling center in Orlando, Florida, recently played “The Blessed Island” by a singer who included those four words in its lyrics, she provoked an unexpected reaction from clients.\n\n“People who had come from Puerto Rico were crying with a horrible feeling of guilt,” she recalled. “They feel like, ‘Wow, I gave up. I wanted to stay.’… Of course they feel hurt.”\n\nIn a recent chain of comments on Twitter about the merits of staying against going, one Puerto Rican wrote: “Those of you who left are fleeing from catastrophe while those of us who stay will lift the flag even higher than it already is.”\n\nPeople who have left bridle at the criticism.\n\nCarlos Rodriguez, an unemployed security guard and volunteer paramedic, moved with his wife and two young girls to the U.S. mainland on Nov. 2 from their hometown of Cayey, nestled in Puerto Rico’s once-lush central mountains. The family lost its home and car to the storm and is now sleeping on the couch of a relative in Providence, Rhode Island, while looking for permanent housing and a job for Rodriguez. His parents, however, stayed in Puerto Rico.\n\n“You have no idea how much I would like to be able to help my family,” Rodriguez said by phone from Providence. “I’m here trying to do that.”\n\nMaria downed trees, homes and power lines in a 12-hour rampage with winds of up to 154 mph (247 kph). Much of Puerto Rico remains without power and 15 percent has no running water more than a month after the hurricane. It is the longest blackout in U.S. history, and officials have said the overall hurricane damage could range from $45 billion to $95 billion on an island already mired in an 11-year-long recession.\n\nThe post-hurricane exodus will have its own economic impact, said economist Joaquin Villamil, chairman and CEO of Estudios Tecnicos, an economic consulting firm.\n\n“It is having a terrible effect,” he said, noting that retail sales are already down, and that the shrinking population will lead to a drop in tax collections and affect multiple sectors including housing. “Not only are you going to have an older population, but it will be poorer.”\n\nProfessionals are leaving at alarming rates, and the island could see an overall 25 percent drop in population from 2000 to 2025, with 3 million people or less expected to remain by that year, down from 3.8 million nearly two decades ago, Villamil said.\n\n“It’s a very serious problem,” he said. “The demographic transition is the driver of what happens here economically and socially.”\n\nMore: Puerto Rico to cancel contract with small Montana power company\n\nRelated: Google's parent sends Internet balloons to reconnect Puerto Rico cell phones\n\nThe debate about staying or going is rooted in Puerto Rico’s status as a U.S. territory. While their island isn’t a state, Puerto Ricans can seamlessly move elsewhere in the U.S., but many feel an identification with the island that is akin to national pride.\n\n“We need to stay here and help each other. Why are they running away from this problem?” said Sharon Velazquez, a homemaker who lives with her family in the western municipality of San Lorenzo, one of the hardest hit by Hurricane Maria. “We are not giving up … We have to keep fighting.”\n\nThe fight isn’t new in Puerto Rico. About a half million people have left in the past decade as a result of the long economic crisis, according to a report by the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College in New York.\n\n“For some years now, there has been some resentment,” said Luis Martinez-Fernandez, a history professor at University of Central Florida who focuses on Puerto Rico culture. “Those who were adamant about staying and making that point, they have dug deeper in their position.”\n\nOf the more than 140,000 islanders estimated to have left since the storm, more than 130,000 went to Florida alone, followed by Pennsylvania, Texas, New York and New Jersey, researchers at Hunter College said. Among them are an estimated 14,000 public school students, Education Secretary Julia Keleher said.\n\nIvone Nieves, a teacher, spent three days working in water up to her ankles after Maria, then decided to move to Orlando. She arrived Nov. 1, and her partner and four children are scheduled to arrive Dec. 4.\n\nThe family was left without water or power, and Nieves said she wants a better future for her children. She said she already has two job offers.\n\n“We can help lift up the island from anywhere in the United States,” she said.", 'title': 'Hurricane Maria relief efforts set off fierce debate about leaving Puerto Rico', 'url': 'https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/11/09/hurricane-maria-puerto-rico-debate/850820001/', 'keywords': ['rico', 'efforts', 'set', 'leaving', 'hurricane', 'relief', 'power', 'left', 'help', 'maria', 'fierce', 'debate', 'puerto', 'island', 'family', 'stay'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Hurricane Maria relief efforts set off fierce debate about leaving Puerto RicoSAN JUAN, Puerto Rico – The disaster wrought by Hurricane Maria has set off an anguished debate across Puerto Rico, where friends, family and co-workers are arguing fiercely over the morality of leaving the blacked-out island for the U.S. mainland versus fulfilling a patriotic duty to rebuild.\n“People who had come from Puerto Rico were crying with a horrible feeling of guilt,” she recalled.\nMuch of Puerto Rico remains without power and 15 percent has no running water more than a month after the hurricane.\n“We are not giving up … We have to keep fighting.”The fight isn’t new in Puerto Rico.\n“For some years now, there has been some resentment,” said Luis Martinez-Fernandez, a history professor at University of Central Florida who focuses on Puerto Rico culture.', 'date': 1510185600}, {'text': "Tropical Storm Jose is expected to strengthen back into Hurricane Jose later today, bringing high surfs and rip currents to the US East Coast.

At least 74 suspected cases of leptospirosis, a dangerous bacteria, have been reported, including two deaths.\n\nThe federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday it is conducting ongoing tests on suspected leptospirosis samples.\n\nGov. Ricardo Rosselló\'s office said 82% of the island\'s water meters are now active, but many residents say they still have no running water or the water they have is unsafe.\n\nMany people are still collecting water from mountain springs and creeks that run alongside roads. Some know they should boil this water, and others don’t.\n\nPuerto Rico health officials did not comment about the water and health problems.\n\nMorovis Mayor Carmen Maldonado said that despite the governor’s claims, none of the 13 neighborhoods in her city has water service, and the water utility known as AAA is not doing enough to provide it.\n\n“The humanitarian crisis that so many speak of is what we are living daily in Morovis, while the AAA refuses to look for alternatives,” Maldonado said in a statement.\n\n“We’re worried that in places even that have running water whether that water is safe,” said Erik Olson, health program director at the Natural Resources Defense Council.\n\nHis group reported in May that Puerto Rico’s water system had the worst record under the Safe Water Act, with 70% of the people living with water that violated standards set by the U.S. law.\n\nAnd now the situation is worse, Olson said.\n\n“The drinking water system in Puerto Rico was already very fragile,” Olson said. “When you lose water pressure, what can happen is if there’s groundwater contamination with sewage or flooding, that water can get into those pipes.”\n\nIn the coastal municipality of Loiza, 20 miles east of the capital San Juan, municipal officials are providing water to 29,000 residents with tanker trucks and going house-to-house with bottled water, said Israel Morales Alicea, the town\'s communications adviser.\n\nAlicea said he is not worried about a health crisis because with each delivery, municipal workers emphasize the importance of drinking bottled water.\n\nIricelis Ortiz, 42, said municipal officials have yet to pass through her neighborhood, so residents organized a committee to ask the city for what they need.\n\nOrtiz worries that the bad-tasting, blue-colored water that runs in her pipes is unsafe. She and her aunt use it only to clean clothes and dishes, and to shower. They had tried boiling it, but “it tasted weird,” Ortiz said.\n\nBottled water can be hard to find and gets expensive, said her aunt, Maria Ortiz, 66. “If you are lucky to find some, a pack of 24 water bottles that used to be $3.99 now is about $7.50,” she said.\n\nMedical workers who volunteered across the island report similar patterns of symptoms almost everywhere.\n\n“Over the past two weeks, we’ve seen a continuous stream of adult and pediatric patients with gastrointestinal illness, most often involving fever, vomiting and diarrhea,” said Christopher Tedeschi, an emergency medicine physician at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, who returned last Thursday from Puerto Rico. “It’s hard to say the source — or more likely sources — of the illness, although contaminated food and water are very likely.”\n\nTedeschi said his team treated more than 1,000 patients in the town of Manatí, 30 miles west of the capital. They also met with dozens of residents who either didn’t have access to clean water or weren’t sure if their water was safe.\n\n“While boiling is an easy way to decontaminate water, most people I spoke to either didn’t (have) electricity or cooking gas to get that done,” he said.\n\nLlamara Padró, a nurse at New York\'s Upstate University Hospital, who volunteered with a group of 40 nurses organized by the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), said they treated people with gastrointestinal symptoms and conjunctivitis. They also saw patients with scabies and asthma, which she suspected was related to sleeping in damp, moldy houses with damaged roofs.\n\n“It’s right now a public health crisis,” said Padró, whose group worked in more than a dozen communities across Puerto Rico.\n\n“They have no electricity, have no way of purifying water," Padró said. "People are using PVC pipes and collecting water that is contaminated by dead animals, sewage and leptospirosis that comes from rat feces.”\n\nThe teachers’ union has raised more than $300,000 to send thousands of household gravity-operated water filters and a few larger filtration pumps that run on electricity to the island.

And it’s only the beginning.”\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is helping to lead recovery efforts in Puerto Rico, has paid out more than $125 million in individual disaster aid and distributed more than 28 million meals and 35 million liters of water. The Sept. 20 Category 4 hurricane ripped through the center of the island, killing at least 55 people and displacing thousands.\n\nBut Maria\'s widespread destruction and its distance from the U.S. mainland pose unique challenges as efforts shift from emergency response to long-term recovery, said Mike Byrne, the FEMA official coordinating the federal response in Puerto Rico.\n\n“When you go from a complete stop to moving forward on major reconstruction on an island 1,000 miles from the mainland, it’s going to take time,” he said.\n\n\'A lot of panic attacks\': Mental health top concern in Maria-ravaged Puerto Rico\n\nSeven weeks later: Puerto Ricans remain in survival mode after Hurricane Maria\n\nWhen aid lages: Puerto Rican musical family helps neighbors after Maria\n\nPizarro and other parochial and non-profit groups such as his have been filling key gaps left behind by federal responders.\n\nBuilt more like a boxer than a minister, Pizarro — known as “Pastor Bert” to friends and congregants — grew up in Brooklyn and Queens. He came to Puerto Rico 12 years ago with his wife, Zoharis, as an Assemblies of God missionary. Pizarro later started his own church in San Juan. He worked with victims of Haiti’s earthquake, helping children and digging wells for locals there.\n\nWhen Maria hit Puerto Rico, he quickly realized his mission would change to disaster relief, he said.\n\n“Trees down, power lines down, roofs gone, massive amount of debris all over the place,” Pizarro said. “It was the same everywhere: Devastation.”\n\nIn those first few days after the storm, Pizarro said he saw teams of FEMA and U.S. military clearing roads and debris. But no one seemed to be bringing in supplies.\n\nThrough church contacts in the U.S., Pizarro raised money and bought $200,000 worth of groceries from island wholesalers and trucked them directly into neighborhoods. Days into the disaster, bags full of rice, beans, oil, salt, water, tomato sauce and other supplies began arriving in some of the hardest-hit areas of Puerto Rico.\n\n“I called all of our pastors and said, ‘I’m sending you trucks with 200 bags full of goods and water. Release them to your people,’” he said.\n\nWhen he heard the main hospital in Bayamón was running low on surgical supplies, he tapped more sources and bused in eight duffle bags full of surgical gauge, bandages, antibiotics and other supplies, which were running low after the storm.\n\n“When they came here with all the supplies, they made me cry,” said Tamara Behar, the hospital’s executive director. “All the kindness. You saw they wanted to help you. It was very emotional.”\n\nWord of Pizarro\'s efforts spread.\n\nIn mid-October, he received a phone call from a member of a volunteer medical team with the Syrian American Medical Society. The group was in Puerto Rico to volunteer their services and FEMA set them up in a 250-bed clinic in Ponce, in the southern part of the island. In more than a week, they had seen only 11 patients. Frustrated, one of the members called Pizarro.\n\nPizarro picked up the group of volunteer doctors and nurses and shuttled them to clinics in San Juan, Toa Baja and Utuado. In four days, the team worked with nearly 200 patients.\n\n“When they came to me, it was a leap of faith,” he said. “But I told them, ‘You get here and I’ll put you to work.’”\n\nAfter Pizarro posted a Facebook video asking for more help, volunteer teams reached out — from Chicago, New York, Texas. He houses the incoming teams at the district headquarters of the Assemblies of God or at the San Juan YMCA. One of his greatest needs: more cargo vans to shuttle teams around the island.\n\nIn a darkened room at his church\'s regional headquarters, color-coded poster boards paper an entire wall showing flight information, missions and contact numbers for incoming teams. His teams are booked through mid-December. So far, Pizarro has brought help to 72 of Puerto Rico\'s 78 municipalities.\n\nOn a recent trip to Arecibo, on the western part of the island, Pizarro and a group of volunteers from Chicago and New York donned boots and gloves and went to work shoveling weeks-old river muck out of the Templo Pentecostal La Hermosa, an Assemblies of God church hit with 12 feet of floodwater during Maria.\n\nBy lunchtime, the team had cleared out most of the muck and removed the flood-ruined pews and furniture. The goal: Make the church ready for Sunday service.\n\nMiguel Segarra, the church’s pastor, said he applied for FEMA aid shortly after the storm but hadn’t heard back from the federal agency. He had all but given up on saving the church.\n\n“Extraordinary,” he said, as volunteers ferried out wheelbarrows full of dirt and debris. “At the end of the day, God takes care of you, no one else.”\n\nPizarro moved his wife and two young kids, ages 8 and 4, to New York a few weeks ago. He\'ll fly there next week to spend Thanksgiving with his family, then return to the business of resurrecting Puerto Rico.\n\n"As long as teams keep coming, I’ll be here," he said.\n\nTo donate to Pizarro: Visit www.connectedlifepr.com, or email pastor@connectedlifepr.com.\n\nFollow Jervis on Twitter: @MrRJervis.', 'title': 'Pastor a lifeline for many as he works to resurrect Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria', 'url': 'https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/11/17/pastor-lifeline-many-he-works-resurrect-puerto-rico-after-hurricane-maria/867417001/', 'keywords': ['rico', 'water', 'works', 'hurricane', 'teams', 'god', 'juan', 'resurrect', 'maria', 'pastor', 'lifeline', 'federal', 'pizarro', 'puerto', 'island', 'volunteer'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': "Pastor a lifeline for many as he works to resurrect Puerto Rico after Hurricane MariaSAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — For years, Pastor Humberto “Bert” Pizarro, head of an Assemblies of God mission in San Juan, supplied mostly spiritual guidance and prayer to his congregants.\n“I never thought I could impact an entire island,” Pizarro, 42, said.\nHe came to Puerto Rico 12 years ago with his wife, Zoharis, as an Assemblies of God missionary.\nWhen Maria hit Puerto Rico, he quickly realized his mission would change to disaster relief, he said.\nHe'll fly there next week to spend Thanksgiving with his family, then return to the business of resurrecting Puerto Rico.", 'date': 1510876800}, {'text': 'When we met Dr. Bolivar Arboleda Osorio in the city of Caguas a few weeks back, he talked about his experience treating patients in the aftermath of the storm -- first came the trauma victims, then came the chronic and severe cases that were becoming emergencies as time dragged on and the lights stayed off. Electronic records were stuck in the cloud. Patients, not able to call for an appointment, just showed up.\n\nLea esta historia en español. / Read this story in Spanish.\n\nThings are slightly better now. Arboleda Osorio said his house doesn’t have power, but the hospital he works in does. Slowly, small bits of progress are being made. But he’s thinking about the long-term, too -- and he’s concerned.\n\n“A friend of mine, she’s a gynecologist,” he said. “She decided not to reopen her practice. She decided that this was it. She was not coming back.”\n\nMuch of Puerto Rico is still in emergency response mode, as water and electricity continue to be in short supply -- nearly two months after Hurricane Maria hit. But these immediate concerns could lead to longer-term problems. Arboleda Osorio is concerned that the storm will lead to another kind of shortage: a lack of doctors.\n\nHis office was fine after Maria. He didn’t lose his windows. But others, in the same building, had their windows blown out.\n\n“Some lost everything, their offices,” Arboleda Osorio said. “So they’re moving into some of their friends’ offices to at least have some place to practice. Others that were looking into moving to the states decided that this is it. I’m gone.”\n\nNow, he fears that Maria will make an existing problem worse. Doctors have been leaving the island for years. For a number of reasons, including low federal reimbursements for procedures, physicians have long made less money in Puerto Rico than they could on the mainland.\n\n“Over this past year, we had lost physicians at a rate four times bigger than the rate of emigration. People are moving, going somewhere else. Not just because of the economy. It’s because they don’t feel safe,” he said. “They don’t feel that the government will be able to provide for everybody’s well-being.”\n\nMaking matters worse, the doctor said young surgeons are leaving, too. He said few will be around to take his place.\n\n“We had only one program up to four or five years ago,” he said. “And that training program graduated five general surgeons a year. Most of those go to do a subspecialty and, when they do, they usually stay in the states.”\n\nThe numbers are bad. His hospital needs 250 doctors, but it only has 200. Island-wide, there are only 200 surgeons to serve 3.5 million people, he said. And he said most of those surgeons are around 60 years old.\n\nSo he, too, faces a choice. Arboleda Osorio and his wife -- who is also a doctor -- could very easily leave. But they won’t.\n\n“Over the years, we’ve had a number of offers to move to the states,” he said. “Of course, we have two daughters in Connecticut. So it has been tempting. But we know that we owe our people what we are.”\n\nAnd it’s that sense of debt and duty that seems to keep him and his wife on the island.\n\n“I think God gave us that opportunity for a reason,” he said. “And that reason, to me, is to give back whatever we can to the people who are near us.”\n\nHe said they’ve been given too many opportunities to succeed in Puerto Rico -- too many to leave it behind.\n\nThis story is part of “The Island Next Door,” WNPR’s reporting project about Puerto Rico and Connecticut after Hurricane Maria.', 'title': "After Hurricane Maria, One Doctor's Decision To Stay In Puerto Rico", 'url': 'http://www.wnpr.org/post/after-hurricane-maria-one-doctors-decision-stay-puerto-rico', 'keywords': ['rico', 'worse', 'moving', 'surgeons', 'decision', 'maria', 'osorio', 'arboleda', 'stay', 'hurricane', 'decided', 'windows', 'puerto', 'doctors'], 'tags': {'Housing and Homelessness', 'Nonprofits', 'Sports', 'Litchfield Region', 'Fairfield Region', 'Students and Schools', 'Health Equity and Access Project', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Special Education', 'Hartford Region', 'Connecticut Garden Journal', 'Small Business', 'Science', 'Mental Health', 'Manufacturing', 'Higher Education', 'Radio for the Deaf', 'Technology', 'Tolland and Windham Region', 'Middlesex and New London Region', 'New Haven Region'}, 'summary': 'Arboleda Osorio said his house doesn’t have power, but the hospital he works in does.\nShe was not coming back.”Much of Puerto Rico is still in emergency response mode, as water and electricity continue to be in short supply -- nearly two months after Hurricane Maria hit.\nArboleda Osorio is concerned that the storm will lead to another kind of shortage: a lack of doctors.\nFor a number of reasons, including low federal reimbursements for procedures, physicians have long made less money in Puerto Rico than they could on the mainland.\nThis story is part of “The Island Next Door,” WNPR’s reporting project about Puerto Rico and Connecticut after Hurricane Maria.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'Orlando, Florida-based therapist Janera Echevarría was not surprised to see an upsurge in the number of Hurricane Maria refugees arriving from the island seeking treatment for anxiety, depression, and stress. After any disaster, the counselor explained, it’s par for the course. In the area, groups and agencies are helping provide services to those who fled the monster storm and its devastating aftermath.\n\n“Even if you were unharmed and your house was okay, living an experience like this is emotionally traumatizing,” said Echevarría of the hurricane that hit Puerto Rico on September 20th. “In one way or another, after a disaster — manmade or natural — it is expected that people will suffer some kind of post traumatic stress.”\n\nHowever, what has alarmed Echevarría, a twenty year veteran in the field of mental health, is how deeply the hurricane’s aftermath has hit islanders who live outside of Puerto Rico.\n\n“I have a client, a 60-year-old grandmother, who stopped eating because she feels guilty that members of her family might be going hungry,” Echevarría said. “I have another client, a woman in her 40’s, who is sleeping on the floor because she says that her sisters lost everything so she is in some form of solidarity with them. She has a perfectly comfortable bed but prefers to suffer and sleep on the cold concrete floor –it’s a form of flagellation.”\n\nThese reactions may seem illogical to some, but for people who are not mentally resilient, it’s the only way they know how to cope with stress. Technically it’s a form of survivor’s guilt, she explained.\n\n“They say things like, “if my sister lost everything, I just can’t be living comfortably here,” she said.\n\nOrlando Florida based mental health counselor Janera Echeverria is treating Puerto Ricans affected by the stress of Hurricane Maria. Courtesy of Janera Echeverria\n\nNearly sixty days after the category five storm landed, millions are still without electricity and desperate for basic necessities such as warm food, water, and shelter. In Echevarría\'s downtown Orlando practice, she has begun seeing the toll such images are taking on the mental health of Central Floridians.\n\n“We’re feeling all kinds of emotions,” she said. “It’s difficult to see any human suffering, but when it’s your cousin, aunt, and extended community, it hits you more directly.”\n\nEchevarría, who was born and raised in the western Puerto Rican town of San Germán, has seen the strain in her inner circle. Discussions around the dinner table revolve around the latest news from the island. Family members and friends discuss having trouble sleeping, experiencing fears about the future of the island, sadness, and some, say they are unable to fully focus as they watch the latest news and hear from family members having a rough time.\n\nThe most vulnerable populations after disasters are children, who don’t have the capacity to understand the scope of the devastation. Echevarría also sees it in women, mostly mothers and grandmothers, who suffer doubly because they are not on the island to do what Puerto Rican mothers do best — nurture their loved ones.\n\nBrain experts say that even witnessing images destruction from afar, such as scenes of strangers\' lives ruined, wound the brain. But if it’s extended family, the wound is deeper.\n\nAccording to U.S Census figures, \u200b\u200bthere are 5.4 million Puerto Ricans living in the 50 states. \u200bMigration has increased by \u200bthe hundreds of thousands in the last decade due to \u200ban unrelenting recession that began in 2006. In 2015 alone, Census numbers show that 89,000 islanders migrated to Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio,\u200band Connecticut\u200b.\n\nFlorida, which already had one million Puerto Ricans, received the bulk of the migrants. In the last decade alone, Central Florida has received more Puerto Rican nationals than any other region in the country, according to local government figures. In 2015, nearly 56,000 islanders moved to the Orlando area. In 2016, the numbers shot up to 89,000.\n\nSince Hurricane Maria, about 139,000 Puerto Ricans have arrived in Florida, according to state figures, at least for temporary lodging while the island grapples with a lack of basic necessities.\n\nBut hundreds of thousands of Floridians have called the Sunshine State home all their lives and have close relatives on the island and closely follow news of the relief and recovery efforts. For them, the hurricane is very personal.\n\n“This is a community that has been doubly hit with two back-to-back major disasters,” said Nancy Rosado, 60, a retired NYPD sergeant who moved to Central Florida ten years ago.\n\nA year ago, a lone gunman opened fire in Pulse nightclub killing 49, and the majority of the victims were Puerto Ricans.\n\n“It’s like we recover from one tragedy only to be hit with another,” said Rosado.\n\nRosado is a veteran of disasters. She was in charge of a mental health unit helping NYPD officers cope with the aftermath of 911. She was already in Florida when the nightclub massacre happened.\n\n“I am a first responder by nature and by training,” she said.\n\nDuring the massacre, Rosado said she that she helped provide culturally competent training for local officials. Everyone grieves and mourns differently and Puerto Ricans are no exception.\n\n"It was important to let officials understand that culturally, we see loss and grieve in a unique way. Our language is different, even the forms of mourning expressions are unique,” she explained.\n\nThis time around, Rosado said she took a step back from the disaster, because she said that “even those trained to help others are also affected.”\n\nRosado, who was born and raised in the Bronx, decided to travel to the Caribbean island of her parents’ birth to distribute goods. She said being on the ground has helped her tremendously.\n\n“You get to directly touch lives,” she said. “Even a hug in times of stress is just as important as a meal.”\n\nRosado is planning a second trip in December and is in the middle of collecting funds to buy solar lights.\n\n“Island life is very stressful now,” she said. “The darkness is driving people mad, not to mention the hard and loud sounds of generators running all night that keeping people from a good night’s rest. And then she said, “there’s burning diesel—the smell of diesel is disgusting.”\n\nExperts say that directly helping others is one of the ways to cope with stress. Another way is to take a break from the news cycle, as images do cause harm and humans are not built to take in so much suffering at once.\n\nResidents affected by Hurricane Maria wait in line to receive unemployment checks outside a government unemployment office along Puerto Rico Highway 2, outside San Juan, Puerto Rico, October 12, 2017. SHANNON STAPLETON / Reuters\n\nOne of the most important ways to handle stress is to talk about it.\n\n“It’s important to recognize the feelings,” Rosado explained. She said for cops it was vital to talk about what they witnessed with friends and family, and in many cases, with professionals.\n\n“For Puerto Ricans, therapy is not the norm,” the mental health professional explained. “We are used to staying in the family. But this is something catastrophic and we have to be able to open up. My suggestion is that if you feel like you can’t handle seeing so much loss, to get help from a culturally competent professional.”\n\n“It’s important for anyone suffering from afar to now that they are not alone," said Rosado. "Others are feeling the same way.”', 'title': 'After Hurricane Maria, mental health specialists see toll among U.S. Puerto Ricans', 'url': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/after-hurricane-maria-mental-health-specialists-see-toll-among-u-n820741', 'keywords': ['ricans', 'health', 'rosado', 'hurricane', 'important', 'mental', 'stress', 'way', 'maria', 'toll', 'family', 'puerto', 'island', 'specialists'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Orlando Florida based mental health counselor Janera Echeverria is treating Puerto Ricans affected by the stress of Hurricane Maria.\nAccording to U.S Census figures, \u200b\u200bthere are 5.4 million Puerto Ricans living in the 50 states.\nFlorida, which already had one million Puerto Ricans, received the bulk of the migrants.\nA year ago, a lone gunman opened fire in Pulse nightclub killing 49, and the majority of the victims were Puerto Ricans.\n“For Puerto Ricans, therapy is not the norm,” the mental health professional explained.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'President Trump pitched rolls of paper towels into the crowd during his visit to Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, after Hurricane Maria.

Others are relying on propane from rapidly depleting tanks to boil what water they are able to find. It becomes a survival calculation, said Roberto José Thomas Ramírez, general coordinator of the Eco-Development Initiative of Jobos Bay in southern Puerto Rico.\n\n"Every day, I visited at least three or four stores looking for bottled water, and I didn\'t get any, so every night I try to do the math to be able to boil water and not use enough gas to be able to also cook," Ramírez said.\n\nAs the island struggles to recover, the impacts have hit the poor hard. Half of Puerto Ricans live below the poverty level. One of the most sought-after commodities in big box stores are generators strong enough to power an air conditioner. They sell for around $6,000—nearly one-third the median annual household income.\n\nBeverage shelves in an open Walgreens in San Juan were mostly empty on Oct. 13, more than three weeks after the hurricane hit.

It also laid bare "the inequalities and injustices that existed for many years."\n\nThe depth of desperation showed last week when the U.S. EPA said it had received reports of residents "obtaining, or trying to obtain," drinking water from wells at hazardous waste Superfund sites. At least one well, near Dorado, had signs that people had been pulling water from it, though it wasn\'t clear how many people had been there, EPA spokesperson Rusty Harris-Bishop said.\n\n"Sampling of these wells done in 2015 indicated that some exceeded drinking water standards for volatile organic chemicals," Harris-Bishop said in an email. He said the agency would secure the wells and take new samples, and that a truck was distributing water in the community on Friday, with power expected to be restored to the water plant soon so water service could resume.\n\nResidents have been filling empty bottles from springs and other sources. The EPA acknowledged evidence that people had also taken water from a well at at least one Superfund site.

What little potable water she was able to save up in soda bottles before the storm hit, she is using for drinking. Shipments sent by family on the mainland two weeks ago haven\'t arrived.\n\nDisease Outbreaks and a Rising Death Toll\n\nTwenty-three days after Maria made landfall, outbreaks of leptospirosis, a deadly bacterial disease, scabies and conjunctivitis have been reported, as well signs of an uptick in Zika and chikungunya, mosquito borne diseases that were present on the island before the hurricane. In Yabucoa, where the median household income is just $15,600, the mayor said food distributions aren\'t going far enough and people are going hungry.\n\nOfficial government figures place the death toll from the storm at 48 in Puerto Rico. Members of Congress requested an audit of those figures last week after news reports suggested actual deaths related to the storm may be 10 times higher.\n\nWith their medical center damaged by Hurricane Maria and lacking fuel, healthcare workers provided aid from a tent hospital in Dorado after the hurricane.

"A hospital we worked with in Caguas had a major generator failure the other day and had to evacuate its patients."\n\nAnother hospital connected to the grid in San Juan recently lost power as a surgeon was in the middle of heart surgery, he said.\n\nFrustration with the Federal Response\n\nAs frustrations on the island grow, people are increasingly placing the blame on FEMA.\n\n"As more people are going hungry, FEMA keeps doing paperwork," said José Andrés, founder of non-profit food assistance organization World Central Kitchen. "When we should have less people hungry, it seems every day we have more. Puerto Rico was hit by two disasters, the first disaster was natural, the second disaster is man-made by clear lack of leadership."\n\nWorld Central Kitchen had a contract with FEMA to provide 20,000 meals per day that expired on Tuesday. Andrés said his group was providing 70,000 warm meals per day out of 6 kitchens across Puerto Rico without FEMA support as of Wednesday. The group hoped to expand to 100,000 meals by the end of the week but much more was needed for Puerto Rico\'s 3.4 million people, Andrés said. FEMA said it is providing 200,000 meals per day with more than 300,000 additional meals per day coming from volunteer groups.\n\nWashed out bridges and downed trees have made getting food, water and medical supplies into parts of Puerto Rico difficult for the military and aid workers.

After intense backlash, Trump reversed himself on Friday, offering renewed pledges of assistance.\n\nThe federal government has dedicated more than 19,000 personnel to emergency response efforts in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, according to FEMA.

Students must apply by Nov. 1 to attend Tulane in the spring semester, and Tulane will have admitted students pay spring tuition at their home college.\n\nThe university\'s guest semester program was first announced in an Oct. 13 blog post from Tulane\'s admissions department. The program is also open to students affected by Hurricane Irma in the U.S. Virgin Islands and St. Maarten.\n\nTulane is offering this option to students after the university\'s students received similar opportunities from universities nationwide after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. Robin Forman, Tulane\'s provost and senior vice president for academic affairs, stressed by phone Monday that "doing nothing was not an option" for Tulane in response to Maria\'s aftermath.\n\n"After Katrina, Tulane\'s very existence was called into question," Forman said. "We would not have survived in any way like the Tulane we are today if it hadn\'t been for several dozen universities stepping forward and supporting our students and our faculty."\n\n"We owe our existence to others and it\'s very much part of our essence that we look for opportunities to help others in the way that they\'ve helped us."\n\nAlthough the logistics of the program are still being sorted out, Forman said Tulane wants guest students to use their tuition to support the recovery efforts at their respective colleges. Tulane\'s recent announcement has already attracted "expressions of interest" from more than 100 students, Forman added.\n\n"We are hoping that many more universities step forward to help the University of Puerto Rico and other universities that are facing the devastation of those hurricanes. It becomes a collective effort," he said.\n\nForman said Tulane is already in touch with other colleges in the area eager to assist collegians affected by Maria. Although the recent circumstances differ from Katrina\'s impact on New Orleans, he stressed Tulane\'s offer is "very much aligned with the spirit of what universities offered our students."\n\nStudents enrolling into Tulane will be deemed full-time, non-degree-seeking undergraduates in the Newcomb-Tulane College. Tulane will also offer advisors to these students, and students are required to return to their home colleges in Puerto Rico once the spring semester ends.\n\nTulane is advising applicants to research off-campus housing options. The university is also seeking residents interested in housing a guest student for the semester. Residents willing to assist Tulane are asked to contact Jeff Schiffman, Tulane\'s director of admission who wrote the blog post.\n\n"It is our hope to be able to provide a temporary home to a group of students who have dealt with the challenges of Hurricane Maria and her aftermath," Schiffman wrote. "The city of New Orleans and Tulane hope to welcome you this spring to help you get your education back on track. New Orleans may not be your home, but we\'ll do our best to make your temporary shelter from the storm."\n\nTulane\'s effort to aid students in Puerto Rico comes after several Florida colleges agreed to provide in-state tuition to students from the island. The Associated Press reported Oct. 14 that Maria caused 48 deaths in Puerto Rico. Gov. Ricardo Rossello\'s office stated about 85 percent of the island remains without power. He told the news service he plans to have power back for half of the island by Nov. 15.\n\nThe University of Puerto Rico\'s 11 campuses closed due to Maria\'s impact. Although students from those universities have already been approved for Tulane\'s program, Puerto Rican students from other schools are asked to state their consent to the program to Satyajit Dattagupta, Tulane\'s vice president for enrollment management and dean of undergraduate admission.\n\nStudents can find the application online (link here), and Tulane encourages applicants to attempt to get any form of transcripts or records of grades for the application. The university will even accept screenshots or photos of the documents. Students notified about their admission have until January 10 to accept Tulane\'s offer.\n\n. . . . . . .\n\nWilborn P.

Storms can also damage infrastructure and interrupt essential needs and public systems such as shelter, food, water, electrical, transportation, and communication, which have indirect, and longer-term effects on public health. Immediate/Short-term impacts: physical injury or death\n\ndrowning Medium- and long-term impacts: limited access to food and safe water\n\ncontamination of water and food sources from waste, debris, and other pollution\n\ndisruption of services at hospitals, clinics, and other care facilities\n\nreduced ability to access health care, medicines or other essential health items\n\nincreased risk from infectious diseases due to lack of safe water, adequate hygiene, and sanitation\n\ngrowing burden from unaddressed chronic disease care needs, such as cancer and diabetes\n\nmental health issues including stress, depression and suicide\n\nStatus before the Hurricane\n\nThe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory located in the Caribbean, with a population of approximately 3.41 million residents as of July 2016. Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens by birth. Prior to Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico faced a number of economic and public health challenges. The island was already in the midst of a debt crisis, following years of economic recession, and in May of this year filed for bankruptcy relief. Close to half of Puerto Rico’s residents lived at or below the federal poverty level in 2016 (43.5%), compared to just 12.7% in the U.S. overall. The median household income in Puerto Rico over 2011-2015 was $19,350, almost one-third the median household income in the US overall ($53,889). The unemployment rate was estimated at 10.1%, a figure more than two times higher than that for US overall (4.1%).\n\nThe health care system also faced challenges. Puerto Ricans were much less likely to have employer sponsored health insurance compared to rest of the U.S. (35% compared to 60%) and more likely to rely on Medicaid (49% compared to 20%), though a smaller proportion were uninsured (6% compared to 9%). Unlike the 50 US states and Washington, DC, Medicaid spending in Puerto Rico has been subject to a statutory cap, which means that under normal circumstances once federal funds are exhausted, the island no longer receives financial support for its Medicaid program for that fiscal year. Many residents of Puerto Rico access primary health care services through community health centers (CHCs), which rely heavily on federal Medicaid funding; there were 93 CHCs in Puerto Rico before the storm serving over 350,000 residents on the island, primarily in rural areas. In one indicator of basic health care access, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) estimated that at the end of 2016, there were just over 19,000 people living in primary “healthcare provider shortage areas” (HPSAs) with just 32% of the need for physicians in these areas being met.\n\nBasic health statistics in Puerto Rico also indicate that the island faced significant health concerns even before the storm. Puerto Ricans were much more likely to report having fair or poor general health compared to the U.S. overall (34% compared to 18%). The percentage of people living with a disability (estimated for 2011-2015) was 15.4% compared to 8.6% in the U.S. overall. Puerto Rico had a higher percentage of low-birthweight infants and a higher infant mortality rate compared to the US overall. The prevalence of diabetes was 50% higher in Puerto Rico compared to the rest of the U.S., including a death rate due to diabetes that was more than three times higher. The HIV death rate in Puerto Rico was nearly four times higher than that of the U.S. overall, and second highest of any state, territory, or federal district in the country (after Washington D.C.) in 2014. The number of people living with HIV in Puerto Rico in 2014 was estimated at 17,072, which represented one of the highest rates of people living with HIV per 100,000 in the U.S.\n\nPuerto Rico has also seen outbreaks of mosquito-borne viral diseases over the last several years, including dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. Zika was first detected on the island in December 2015, and since that time Puerto Rico has reported the vast majority (84%) of all U.S. Zika cases. In 2016, the island experienced almost 35,000 symptomatic cases of Zika infection, compared with 6,218 cases in the rest of the U.S. and territories. So far in 2017 there have been far fewer Zika cases in Puerto Rico; 476 infections were reported through October (433 cases were reported in the rest of the U.S./territories). Some public health experts believe the decline in cases stems from the fact that a large proportion of the population was infected earlier and is now immune, creating a level of “herd immunity.” Still, the potential for further Zika outbreaks does exist. Other endemic infectious diseases of concern in Puerto Rico include leptospirosis, a serious, sometimes fatal bacterial infection usually transmitted via exposure to contaminated surface water.\n\nPost-Hurricane Public Health Status\n\nHurricane Maria has significantly damaged key transportation, communication, and electricity infrastructure across the island which in turn have exacerbated already challenged health conditions. Immediately after the hurricane, there was virtually no electricity, available water, or transportation access on the island. On October 12, three weeks after the hurricane struck, only 392 miles of Puerto Rico’s 5,073 miles of roads were open according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency; it is unclear how many of the islands’ roads remain impassible now. Damage to cell towers and antennae, still being repaired, has left a reported 28% of people without telecommunication access as of November 8. While access to electricity has been increasing, it stood at 43% on November 16 (by comparison, the percent of population with access to electricity at the global level is over 80%; the country with the lowest access in the world, Papua New Guinea, has 40%); the remainder rely on generators or go without power. The ongoing power outage on the island has been named the “largest blackout in American history”. On November 9 and again on November 14, major power outages following power line failures and technical issues at the main power plant left 80% of the island without power, underscoring systemic weaknesses in the power grid., The goal of the Puerto Rico government is to be able to restore power to 50 percent of the population by the end of November, and power to all by spring or summer 2018.\n\nWith these broader issues in mind, major public health concerns on Puerto Rico post-hurricane include the following:\n\nMortality\n\nThe official death toll on Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria, as of November 4, stood at 55, primarily from more immediate impacts, but this is widely understood to be an underestimate.,, Officials have stated that there were 472 additional deaths in September 2017 compared to September 2016, though the cause of many of these excess deaths or their potential link to the hurricane has not been certified. Barriers to an accurate and updated accounting of deaths include insufficient resources and challenges in transportation, communication, and organization in confirming and certifying causes of death. The official count of the number of deaths caused by the Hurricane is likely to increase over time as more deaths and their causes are counted and confirmed and longer term health complications set in.\n\nFood, Water and Sanitation\n\nMany island residents have had difficulties accessing groceries and fresh food, relying on meals provided by FEMA, the Red Cross, World Central Kitchen, and other entities. According to Puerto Rico officials, emergency responders are still providing 1 million meals per day on the island as of the first week of November. Lack of access to adequate food results in malnutrition, which can cause and exacerbate other health issues.\n\nRight after the storm, access to water was minimal, with water treatment and pumping stations knocked out by the storm. Even by October 1, almost two weeks later, it was still at less than 50%. Since that time, access has increased slowly (see Figure 1). As of November 16, Puerto Rico’s water authority reports that 91% of the population had access to water, leaving about 9% (about 300,000 people) still without access. While the percentage with access in Puerto Rico has been improving over time (see Figure 1), it is still variable across the territory. San Juan metro region has the highest percentage with access to potable water (97%), while the West region has the lowest (86%). While the water authority reports the water is safe to drink, the Puerto Rico health department is still recommending residents boil or otherwise disinfect all water before drinking or cooking.\n\nSome of those without access to safe water have been using natural fresh water sources such as ponds, lakes, and streams. Ingesting or other exposure to untreated fresh surface water is potentially dangerous due to possible contamination with disease-causing microbes. While no official case numbers are available, there are many reports in the media, from health care providers on the island, and from government officials that there has been an increase in conditions related to unclean water, ranging from vomiting and diarrhea to conjunctivitis (pink eye), scabies and asthma., In addition, by the end of October Puerto Rico had already reported 121 cases and 4 confirmed deaths from leptospirosis since the hurricane (compared to about 60 cases in total in a regular year) One difficulty in diagnosing infectious diseases is that public health laboratory testing on the island has been interrupted due to damage from the storm.\n\nAnother concern is the leaching of raw sewage or other contamination into drinking water sources. A reported 20 of the island’s 51 sewage treatment plants were out of service as of October 17, due mainly to lack of power. As a result, sewage has been identified as contaminating sources people are using for drinking water. In addition, the water authority briefly distributed water taken from a well at an EPA-designated groundwater contamination (“Superfund”) site, but this is no longer the case. Authorities have barred residents from accessing water at other groundwater wells with potentially dangerous levels of chemical or other contamination.\n\nHealth Care Infrastructure\n\nHospitals and other health care infrastructure suffered extensive damage from the storm, and most hospitals were left without electricity and with limited access to generators with fuel. Only three major hospitals were functioning on the island three days after the hurricane, but repair has progressed since then. At this point, while all hospitals tracked by the Puerto Rico government are open and functioning, 26 of the 65 hospitals (40%) with available information were still running on generators rather than regular electric power as of November 8. This means power may be available on an intermittent or limited basis (especially when generators fail or run out of fuel), which can result in the need to rely on alternative light sources such as flashlights when conducting surgery or providing other medical care., Community health Centers (CHCs) have also been affected by the storm, with 10 of the 93 (11%) CHC sites reported closed as of October 20 (four weeks after the hurricane); it is unclear how many remain closed currently.\n\nGiven the high burden of diabetes on Puerto Rico, dialysis centers are an important part of the health care system. Almost all of the island’s 47 dialysis centers lost power after the Hurricane, though most of these centers have now re-opened. Still, many dialysis centers do not have regular electrical power and must rely on generators. Generator power has failed at some dialysis centers, and patients have been transported to other areas (including some to the continental U.S.) for treatment.\n\nIn another indicator of the challenges faced by Puerto Ricans in accessing health care on the island, the latest estimates from HRSA indicate that 1,689,212 people – almost half of the population –lived in HPSAs as of November 7, with less than 2% of the need for physicians being met.\n\nOther Infectious Diseases\n\nAs mentioned above, Puerto Rico faces a number of endemic mosquito-borne diseases such as Zika, dengue, and chikungunya. Although it is common for mosquito populations to increase in the weeks after major rain events, raising the potential risk for mosquito-borne disease outbreaks, at this time there is no evidence that the island is experiencing any large-scale outbreaks of these diseases. Likewise, Puerto Rico faced a significant public health challenge from HIV prior to the hurricane, so there is increased concern about people living with HIV, and their access to medicines and other support services. While HIV program authorities on the island continue to face intermittent communication and power challenges, thus far no major interruptions in services have been reported or are evident and all Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program funded clinics are open.\n\nMental Health\n\nMedia reports and statements from public health officials on the island indicate that many Puerto Ricans are struggling with mental health issues in the wake of the hurricane. Thirty-two suicides have been reported and demand for mental health services has increased sharply in the nearly two months since the storm struck. Anxiety and depression are frequently reported, even by those who never experienced these issues before. An ongoing concern is lack of access to drug treatment and and mental health services for those who need them. Mental health concerns may even increase over the coming months and years as people move beyond the immediate crisis and attempt to return to a normal life. Studies of those affected by Hurricane Katrina, for example, found that rates of mental illness remained elevated for more than a year after that disaster.,\n\nConclusion\n\nGiven the state of emergency on the island and the fact that many basic services are still not fully functioning, the full impact of the Hurricane on public health is difficult to assess. What is clear is that even before Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico, the island faced a host of economic and public health concerns, and that the storm exacerbated many of these challenges while introducing new ones. Concerns may change over time as the immediate crisis response transitions to recovery, and additional health issues may manifest over the longer-term. Ultimately, the public health toll from the storm on the people of Puerto Rico will depend on a number of factors including the level and effectiveness of external support, and continued attention to and funding for response and recovery from policymakers now and going forward.', 'title': 'Public Health in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria', 'url': 'https://www.kff.org/other/issue-brief/public-health-in-puerto-rico-after-hurricane-maria/', 'keywords': ['rico', 'health', 'island', 'water', 'access', 'power', 'compared', 'maria', 'hurricane', 'public', 'puerto'], 'tags': {'Disparities Policy', 'Puerto Rico/Virgin Islands', 'Water Sanitation', 'Public Health', 'Other', 'Zika', 'Prescription Drugs', 'HIV/AIDS in U.S.', 'Mental Health', 'Immigrants', 'Global Health Policy'}, 'summary': 'Drawing on federal and Puerto Rican government statistics and official statements, along with media reports, this issue brief provides a snapshot of key public health challenges in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.\nPublic Health Effects of Hurricanes The high winds and flooding from hurricanes have direct health impacts during the storm itself and immediately after.\nPrior to Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico faced a number of economic and public health challenges.\nThe median household income in Puerto Rico over 2011-2015 was $19,350, almost one-third the median household income in the US overall ($53,889).\nBasic health statistics in Puerto Rico also indicate that the island faced significant health concerns even before the storm.', 'date': 1510956156}, {'text': 'Unfortunately, our website is currently unavailable in most European countries.

Journalists on the ground in Puerto Rico and here on the mainland have helped paint a very different picture of underreported deaths, prompting members of Congress to demand audits of the death count.\n\nNow two social science researchers have shown that the actual death count may be closer to 1,085, a number that exceeds the government’s official figure by a factor of 18. (By comparison, at least 1,800 people died in connection to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 — the deadliest hurricane to hit US soil in the past 50 years.)\n\nAlexis Santos, a Puerto Rican demographer at Penn State, and Jeffrey Howard, an independent health scientist and epidemiologist, calculated average monthly deaths from 2010 through 2016 using a methodology that other researchers have told Vox is one of the best ways to calculate estimates of disaster deaths.\n\nSantos and Howard used the Puerto Rico Vital Statistics System to compare the historical averages for September and October of the past seven years to the total number of September and October 2017 deaths recently reported by the Puerto Rico Department of Public Safety to see if there were notable differences.\n\nThe results were staggering: They found that in September 2017 — the month that Maria hit — there were 518 more deaths than the recent historical average for September and 567 more deaths in October 2017 than the recent historical average for October. That’s a total of 1,085 deaths likely linked to the hurricane. And given that widespread power outages have continued into November, the number of indirect deaths from the hurricane is probably higher still.\n\nThe finding supports reports from several media outlets, including Vox, CNN, and BuzzFeed, that found hundreds of hurricane-related deaths that were not included in the official count. These reports were based on interviews with funeral home directors, doctors, and local officials. On November 21, a CNN investigation found 499 hurricane-related deaths reported by funeral homes from September 20 to October 19, for example.\n\nThe government of Puerto Rico has defended its methodology of counting storm deaths, repeating that its figure, last updated to 62 on December 2, is accurate. But rather than actively trying to find and investigate reports of deaths in the aftermath of the storm, it has been passive, counting only deaths where all the information was easily accessible. The government has also been overly cautious in linking deaths to the hurricane, despite the strong evidence indicating that the real number is more likely in the hundreds, if not thousands.\n\nTo be sure, the hurricane severely damaged not just Puerto Rico’s power infrastructure and health care system but also basic government functions and medical data collection. And the island’s death processing system has been totally overwhelmed.\n\nSantos and Howard’s work is still in preprint form, which means it has not yet been through peer review. And the government still has not released its official death totals for September and October. So treat these findings as preliminary.\n\nBut they suggest that the official toll is far from accurate and does not convey the extent of the impact of the hurricane. (A New York Times analysis of the same data from Puerto Rico’s Vital Statistics System also found that in the 42 days after the storm hit, 1,052 more people than usual died across the island.)\n\n“The issue of how many deaths there were from the devastation goes hand in hand with the attention this is going to get in Congress,” said Santos.\n\nPuerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló recently asked that Congress and federal agencies give $94.4 billion in funds for recovery, on the grounds that it will be the “most transparent” recovery effort in US history.\n\nBut there isn’t much transparency around this statistic that is fundamental to understanding this disaster — the death toll shapes how we perceive the extent of the harm, how we assess the response, and how many resources we allocate for recovery. And Puerto Ricans, meanwhile, are being left in the dark, wondering if their loved ones lost after the storm will ever be acknowledged by their government.\n\nMedia isn’t buying the government’s death toll\n\nThe dispute between the government and the media over the Hurricane Maria death toll began when an investigative reporter on the island, Omaya Sosa Pascual, questioned the official death toll of 16 in a story on September 28, eight days after the storm hit. Sosa confirmed that there were dozens of hurricane-related deaths the government had not yet accounted for and that the true number was likely in the hundreds.\n\nYet the official number didn’t rise.\n\nThe number, still 16, then became politicized on October 3 when President Donald Trump visited the island and insisted that the alleged 16 deaths were evidence that Puerto Rico wasn’t a “real catastrophe” like Hurricane Katrina. "Everybody watching can really be very proud of what\'s taken place in Puerto Rico," he said.\n\nSince then, the death count has slowly risen to 62. But several media outlets, including Vox and Sosa’s organization, the Center for Investigative Journalism (CPI), have collected ample evidence that the real number is much higher — and that the government continues to underreport it.\n\nThe government tried to put the issue to rest forever in a press conference on November 8 that was intended to provide reporters with more details about how it had calculated the official toll, by then 55.\n\n"We want to explain this to you all so that all doubts about how we counted the deaths will finally end here," Héctor Pesquera, head of the Department of Public Safety, said.\n\nBut instead of resolving doubts, officials presented new data suggesting that the true number is likely much higher (the same data that Santos and Howard used in their analysis). According to the government, there were a little under 3,000 deaths registered on the island in September 2017. That\'s over 500 more deaths than were reported in September 2015 and 2016.\n\n“The reality is that this is not normal and we have to realize that there was a phenomenon here,” said José A. López Rodríguez, a government demographer at the press conference. Yet he stopped short at attributing any of them to the storm. “There needs to be evidence to document it,” he said.\n\nThe storm really did cause more than 62 deaths\n\nBut in fact, there’s plenty of additional evidence to suggest that the number of people who died directly or indirectly from Hurricane Maria is in the hundreds, if not more than 1,000.\n\nFor an initial investigation published October 11, Vox searched Google News for reports of deaths in English and Spanish media from Puerto Rico since Hurricane Maria. We found reports of a total of 81 deaths linked directly or indirectly to the hurricane. Of those, 45 were the deaths certified by the government. The remaining 36 deaths were confirmed by local public officials or funeral directors, according to the reports. We also found another 450 reported deaths, most of causes still unknown, and reports of at least 69 people still missing.\n\nThe investigation prompted two members of the House of Representatives to request an audit of the Puerto Rico death toll from the Department of Homeland Security. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey then demanded the same.\n\nSince then, additional sources and reports continue to point to the same conclusion: that hundreds, not dozens, of people died from the storm, despite claims by President Trump and Puerto Rican officials that the count is 62 or fewer.\n\nA CNN investigation surveyed 112 funeral homes on the island — about half of all funeral homes. According to CNN, “Those funeral homes identified 499 deaths in the month after the storm — September 20 to October 19 — which they say were related to Hurricane Maria and its aftermath.”\n\nA prominent former senator for Puerto Rico, Ramón Luis Nieves, told members of Congress at a November 2 hearing that the government\'s official death count can\'t be trusted. "That statistic is misleading. Recent reports state that the government authorized almost 1,000 cremations. Also, on a personal note, dozens of friends have shared with me countless stories of their elderly loved ones dying as a result of the lack of electricity in their homes, hospitals, and care centers. The actual death toll ... has not been properly disclosed by the government of Puerto Rico," Nieves said in his prepared testimony.\n\nPuerto Rico’s office of vital statistics has sent 2,747 death records to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for review since Maria hit the island, said Wanda Llovet, the head of Puerto Rico\'s office of vital statistics, at the November 8 press conference. (In response to a Freedom of Information Act request from Vox, a FOIA officer at the CDC stated on November 28 that it has not received these records.)\n\nAs of November 3, there were 388 cadavers at the Bureau of Forensic Sciences, some of which had been examined and some of which had not.\n\nBuzzFeed News reported on October 27 that 911 bodies were cremated before being inspected by the medical examiner to determine if the deaths occurred because of the storm. (The government later said that all of those people died of "natural causes," but none of the bodies were examined by medical professionals.)\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency told Vox it had received 2,339 applications for burial and funeral assistance in Puerto Rico since Maria hit, as of November 6. The federal agency helps cover some funeral and burial expenses for disaster-related deaths, or to rebury cadavers and repair graves that were disturbed during a storm.\n\nFEMA has determined that 537 of those burial applications were not related to Hurricane Maria, including people who erroneously asked for funeral assistance while seeking other FEMA aid. There were an additional 168 pending cases where applicants had provided the required documentation, or were in the process of getting it to FEMA, as of November 6. It\'s unclear how many of the 2,339 applications are seeking help to bury people who died from the storm, or to repair grave sites disturbed by the hurricane.\n\nPuerto Rico’s death toll problem seems to be partly a data collection problem\n\nThere are no state or federal guidelines in the US for calculating storm death tolls for the medical examiners usually responsible for determining what constitutes a storm-related death. (And partly because many storm-related deaths aren’t recorded, the “official” Hurricane Katrina death toll is widely regarded as inaccurately low.)\n\nIn the case of Puerto Rico, the government was only counting deaths that doctors clearly stated were related to the storm on death certificates. For example, a doctor who writes that a person died from head trauma because they were hit by a brick while cleaning up storm debris would be a clear hurricane-related death.\n\nOther scenarios are less clear: A doctor states that a person died from respiratory problems, and then mentions in the death certificate that the hospital didn\'t have enough oxygen tanks. Pesquera, head of Puerto Rico’s Department of Public Safety, says that in such a case, medical examiners are supposed to contact the doctor to find out if the hospital didn\'t have oxygen because of the hurricane. If that\'s the case, then the death is counted in the official death toll.\n\nAnother problem with the data collection system is that some hurricane-related deaths don\'t fit into either of those categories. These are the death certificates that do not mention whether a hospital had no power, or water, or oxygen. If a doctor didn\'t include those details, then medical examiners do not check to see if crucial information has been left out. The government will simply not include it in the storm-related death count.\n\n“How are we going to question the authority of a licensed doctor?” Pesquera said at a November 8 press conference, when asked why medical examiners aren\'t investigating each reported death.\n\nBut many doctors don’t have the time to investigate each death and are not directly asked to. So there may be no way for many deaths to ever be counted in the official toll.\n\nWhy the death toll matters\n\nAs much as the death toll is a literal number, it means so much more. It affects how we perceive the extent of the harm caused by a disaster, how we assess the response, and how many resources we allocate for recovery.\n\nSome 32 percent of the 3.4 million American citizens on the island still don’t have power, and 9 percent still don’t have water to drink or bathe in. And while the government of Puerto Rico claims that most people now have running water, that is highly misleading, as Vox has explained. People may get running water in their homes on one day and then lose it the next. Thousands of people still don\'t have roofs on their homes, and are waiting for the US Army Corp of Engineers to install blue tarps.\n\nThis harsh reality isn\'t reflected in the public narrative.\n\nFEMA and the US Army have been winding down their emergency response in Puerto Rico, even though access to food, water, and power is still precarious. The USS Comfort, a military medical ship deployed to Puerto, left weeks ago.\n\nMeanwhile, the government of Puerto Rico continues to downplay the impact of the storm, which is most evident in the strangely low death count. Underreporting the number of people who died from the storm is serious, writes Carlos Yordán, an economist and international relations professor at Drew University.\n\nIt damages trust in government, reinforcing views that public officials will always put politics before the needs of the people they represent, he writes. It also lets government officials off the hook from doing the hard work needed to prevent mass casualties from future storms.\n\n"[It] minimizes the need for a full fledge[d] investigation to determine if some of these deaths could have been prevented, or whether the island’s medical facilities were negligent in terms of providing treatment to their most vulnerable patients," writes Yordán, who is from Puerto Rico.\n\nBy not fully investigating and accurately reporting the death toll, the government of Puerto Rico is choosing not to hold itself accountable to protect the lives of the people it represents.

Puerto Rico owes creditors more than $70bn with an additional $43bn owed in pension payments.\n\nThe hurricane had sustained winds of 250km per hour when it made landfall on Puerto Rico on September 20, killing at least 55 people.

The passage of that bill wasn\'t guaranteed, as several conservative legislators originally voiced opposition to the measure.\n\nThe legislation, The Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands Equitable Rebuild Act of 2017, would forgive Puerto Rico\'s debt and install a new electrical grid that could withstand future hurricanes.\n\nThe act is supported by numerous Democrats in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, including Elizabeth Warren and Stacey Plaskett, the Virgin Islands\' delegate to the House of Representatives.\n\nSanders\' bill calls for the grid to be "rebuilt in a modern, renewable and resilient way", setting aside $100m for renewable energy on the islands.\n\n\'President Trump\'s Katrina\'\n\nHowever, the White House authorised the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to respond to the Puerto Rico crisis under the Stafford Act, which only requires pre-existing infrastructure to be reconstructed.\n\n"The federal government needs to fund rebuilding the electricity grid in a way that makes renewable energy its cornerstone," Judith Enck, a former Environmental Protection Agency regional administrator for District 2, which includes Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, told Al Jazeera in an email.\n\n"Congress must direct FEMA to rebuild the electricity grid in a more resilient way," Enck continued. "Climate change makes hurricanes stronger. More hurricanes will hit the Carribean and we cannot afford to have the old unreliable electricity grid put back up."\n\nEnck worked for the EPA from 2009 until January, leaving the agency days before Trump took office. A longtime environmental activist before taking government positions, she called the Trump administration\'s handling of relief efforts in Puerto Rico "a disgrace".\n\nTrump has said he shouldn\'t be blamed for the continuing troubles Puerto Rico faces. The US president said the territory "was in really bad shape" before the hurricanes struck.\n\nTrump cited Puerto Rico\'s debt, which many detractors blame on a 1970s US tax loophole that allowed corporations to pay little income tax if they moved factories to the US territory.\n\nMany corporations did move to the island but have since left, impacting Puerto Rico\'s economy.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nEnck said Trump should be held responsible for the continuing difficulties.\n\n"This is President Trump\'s Katrina," she concluded, referring to former President George W Bush\'s slow response to the 2005 hurricane that hit New Orleans, Louisiana, which received widespread criticism.\n\nSchroeder, meanwhile, said aid efforts should focus on "making sure that Puerto Rico\'s reconstruction is sufficient to the magnitude of the problem, grounded in equitable growth, creative and forward-looking, rather than limited to replacing what existed before the storm".', 'title': 'Puerto Rico crisis ongoing months after Hurricane Maria', 'url': 'https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/puerto-rico-crisis-ongoing-months-hurricane-maria-171129160235620.html', 'keywords': ['rico', 'hurricane', 'power', 'virgin', 'relief', 'months', 'crisis', 'debt', 'maria', 'grid', 'ongoing', 'ricos', 'puerto'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Puerto Rico remains in dire straits more than two months after Hurricane Maria slammed into the US territory, according to humanitarian organisations and US legislators.\nPuerto Rico owes creditors more than $70bn with an additional $43bn owed in pension payments.\nMaria followed Hurricane Irma, the most powerful Caribbean hurricane on record, which grazed Puerto Rico on September 6.\nMedical crisis continuesThe ensuing damage, estimated to cost up to $95bn, has left Puerto Rico in a healthcare crisis.\nCongress approved a $36bn aid package for Puerto Rico and parts of the US experiencing wildfires on October 24.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'Seventy-one days ago, Hurricane Maria tore through Puerto Rico, bringing unprecedented damage to the island.

Because of difficulties with cell service and internet on the island, that deadline has been extended from Nov. 30 to March 18.\n\nIn October, President Donald Trump signed a relief bill to help rebuild areas of the country damaged by natural disasters this fall, including up to $4.9 billion in loans to help Puerto Rico’s cash-strapped central government.\n\nSo far, FEMA has given more than $230 million in assistance to families and has set aside more than $464 million for reimbursing local authorities to rebuild public buildings and infrastructure. This money comes from FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund. It’s unclear how much of that money Congress just appropriated and how much of it was in the fund prior to the hurricane, a FEMA spokesperson told the NewsHour.\n\nOfficials have said more aid will come. But when? And how much? Here’s what we know about what’s ahead for Puerto Rico’s recovery.\n\nDamage on the ground\n\nTrash and debris from the storm remain a rampant problem. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reported it has removed more than 639,000 cubic yards of debris. But it is still tasked with removing at least 2.7 million remaining cubic yards.\n\nREAD MORE: Puerto Rico hurricane victims still need help. Here’s what you can do\n\n“There is trash and debris all over the place and it is more than an eyesore,” David Begnaud, a CBS News correspondent who was on the island earlier this month, told the NewsHour. “It’s a major issue,” he said, adding that the debris and trash exacerbate flooding.\n\nBegnaud said power remains “to be everything” as the Army Corps repairs the electrical grid.\n\n“Where there is power, it flickers,” he said.\n\nThe funding fight\n\nAfter Congress’ initial aid package, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello said it wasn’t enough.\n\nHe said the island will need $94 billion in disaster aid for infrastructure, housing and long-term recovery.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday that Congressional delegations from the disaster-hit areas were dissatisfied with the White House’s appeal.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the White House asked Congress to approve a $44 billion aid package for hurricane relief that would put the total for disaster relief at nearly $100 billion. The request, which would go toward all areas affected by natural disasters earlier this year, drew criticism from both sides of the aisle.\n\n“This supplemental request fails to provide sufficient funding to help Puerto Rico address immediate needs and set itself on the road to recovery,” Democratic Reps. Jose Serrano, Nydia Velazquez and Luis Gutierrez, co-chairs of the House Hispanic Caucus, said in a statement.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday that Congressional delegations from the disaster-hit areas were dissatisfied with the White House’s appeal. Disaster relief funding would likely not be included in the stopgap spending bill to keep the government open, because it requires more time for discussion, he said.\n\n“We do anticipate moving as quickly as we can, but we know a few days is not going to be enough. It’s going to take longer than that,” Ryan said.\n\nTwo days earlier, Democratic Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren unveiled a bill that would provide $114 billion in aid to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nTheir bill includes:\n\nThe creation of a “credit facility” within the treasury that would approve grants for disaster-related cash shortfalls of up to $57.2 billion\n\n$27 billion for infrastructure building, including renewable energy sources\n\nDebt relief\n\n$51 billion for economic development\n\nAn extended deadline for people to apply for FEMA assistance to 240 days after the disaster occurred\n\nSan Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, who has been critical of the federal response in Puerto Rico, lauded the legislation.\n\n“The bill that Senator Sanders has introduced in the United States Congress is a comprehensive plan that provides the blueprint for the transformation of Puerto Rico,” Cruz said in a statement.\n\nThe package is unlikely to get a vote, analysts say.\n\nWho controls the spending?\n\nOn Monday, Rossello announced the creation of an office that would give FEMA authority to review and approve all federal aid spending on the island.\n\n“We want to embark on the most transparent, effective and efficient recovery process in the history of our nation,” Rossello said during a news conference.\n\nThe AP reported Tuesday that the federal government canceled $30 million in contracts earlier this month with an upstart Florida company that failed to supply directed aid to Puerto Rico. Bronze Star LLC was supposed to bring plastic sheeting and tarps to help with repairs on the island, but months after winning the contracts did not do so. The federal government did not pay Bronze Star.\n\nThis happened after Puerto Rico cancelled its contract with Whitefish Energy after members of Congress and FEMA had raised concerns over how the deal to restore the power grid was reached and demanded an investigation. The company had just two employees when the hurricane hit. But rebuilding the power lines “requires the work of thousands of people,” The New York Times reported, adding that six weeks after the hurricane, the majority of the island was still without power. FEMA warned it might not cover the cost of the contract if it continued, the Times reported.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nOn the island, Gov. Rossello is saying he wants all power restored by Christmas. A majority of schools do not have power, and students study by sunlight.\n\nGov.

As the Island struggles to recover from Hurricane Maria, it is facing one of the biggest spikes in violent crime in nearly a decade. ( Carlos Giusti / The associated Press )\n\nThirty-two people have been slain in Puerto Rico in the first 11 days of the year, double the number killed over the same period in 2017. If the surge proves to be more than just a temporary blip, January could be the most homicidal month on the island in at least two years, adding a dangerous new element to the island’s recovery from Hurricane Maria, its worst disaster in decades. Read more: More than 3 months after Hurricane Maria, barely half of Puerto Rico has power\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nThousands of Puerto Rico police officers calling in sick over unpaid overtime Dark, desperate life without power in Puerto Rico While the number of homicides did not immediately spike in the weeks after the hurricane struck on Sept. 20, police and independent experts say many killings appear at least partly related to its after-effects. The storm has plunged much of the island into darkness, increased economic hardship and contributed to a sick-out by police, all fuelling lawlessness. What’s more, officials say a turf war has broken out among drug gangs looking to grab territory after the storm’s disruption. “Hurricanes affect everyone, including criminals,” said criminologist Jose Raul Cepeda.\n\nAlready bankrupt, the island’s overwhelmed government has fallen behind with millions of dollars in overtime payments owed to police officers, who have begun calling in sick in large numbers to protest. The sick-out has taken about 2,000 police off the street each day in a territory that has 13,600 officers. It has forced more than a dozen police stations to close for several hours to a couple of days during the holiday period because of a lack of officers. No arrests have been made in the 32 killings this year. Maria, which hit as a Category 4 storm, destroyed much of the island’s electrical grid. For those police on duty, the streets are darker and more dangerous because power has been restored to only 60 per cent of customers in the U.S. territory. Drug gangs are fighting to re-establish territory they lost in the disruption from Maria, which pushed thousands from their homes and left entire neighbourhoods uninhabitable for weeks.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nPolice Chief Michelle Hernandez resigned Monday after only a year on the job, and local and federal authorities are rushing from meeting to meeting to debate how to best protect 3.3 million Puerto Ricans, especially those still living in the dark. “This has been devastating,” said Ramon Santiago, a retiree who lives less than a block from where three bodies were discovered Sunday near a basketball court. “You can’t sleep peacefully in so much darkness.” Puerto Rico’s homicide rate is roughly 20 killings per 100,000 residents, compared with 3.7 per 100,000 residents on the U.S. mainland. In the past two years, Puerto Rico has seen an average of 56 homicides a month, a rate that held through December. Then after New Year’s, the killings started accelerating. A man was shot Jan. 3 by a security guard while trying to rob a bakery. Two double homicides were reported Jan. 8 — two men found shot to death in a car near an upscale resort on the north coast and two other men discovered sprawled on the street near a public housing complex on the west coast. Five killings alone were reported Monday, in addition to three people wounded by gunfire during a shootout that night in the parking lot of a strip mall in Bayamon. This week, police say, the son of a former judge was killed after trying to write down the licence plate number of a car whose occupants were firing a gun. “The lack of police is increasing Puerto Rico’s safety issues,” said legislator Denis Marquez, who was mugged at gunpoint last month. “Everybody is feeling that insecurity.” Besides policing and getting the lights back on, he said, the government needs to address long-standing issues such as social inequality on an island with a 10 per cent unemployment rate, where nearly 45 per cent of its inhabitants lived in poverty before the hurricane. More immediately, the post-storm conditions have fuelled a deadly struggle over drug gang territory, said Fernando Soler, vice-president of a police officers’ advocacy group. “There’s a war over the control for drugs,” he told The Associated Press. “They are taking advantage of all the situations occurring in Puerto Rico. There’s no power and they believe there’s a lack of police officers . . . Criminals are taking care of business that was pending before the hurricane.” Inspector Elexis Torres heads a unit that is investigating eight homicides in a jurisdiction that includes the working-class city of Carolina near Puerto Rico’s north coast, bordering the island’s main airport. One of Puerto Rico’s largest cities with nearly 160,000 people, Carolina had the triple homicide reported Sunday; a motel employee and a friend were found slain Tuesday in neighbouring Trujillo Alto. Like nearly all the killings this year, they involve men in their 20s who were shot to death. Torres said he suspects both cases are drug related. He worries the number of killings will only increase as criminal gangs enter into cycles of revenge. “Those victims likely belonged to some organization,” Torres said of the triple homicide. “This can have consequences.” Cepeda, the criminologist, said drug traffickers have been entering rival territories to increase sales and recover losses after the storm disrupted their business. Hurricane Maria caused an estimated $95 billion (U.S.) in damage, with 30,000-plus jobs lost in an economy that was already struggling from an 11-year-old recession. The last time Puerto Rico saw a spike in violent crime was in 2011, when a record 1,136 killings were reported on an island of nearly four million people. Puerto Rico had seen a drop in killings, to 700 in 2016 and 679 last year.

You know that Carly Simon song, ‘You’re so vain, you probably think this song is about you’? He probably thought that Maria was about him.”\n\n“But it wasn’t about him, it wasn’t about politics; it was about saving lives,” she continued. “FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency] was asking Puerto Ricans to go online and register for support. For heaven’s sake, we have no electricity. FEMA kept asking for memos, as if this were the first disaster that they had ever encountered. I finally lost my patience and stopped being politically correct. And I just shouted out an SOS to the world: ‘We’re dying here!’ That didn’t make me a lot of friends in the federal government, but that’s my duty.”\n\nIn the weeks following the storm’s landfall in Puerto Rico, Cruz publicly asked FEMA to prioritize lives over bureaucracy. The decision to call out the Trump administration sparked a headline-grabbing Twitter feud with the president, who said she was “nasty” and that the people of Puerto Rico wanted “everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort.”\n\nIn October, the mayor told HuffPost she felt it was “unthinkable” the federal government could not bring enough supplies to meet the needs of hurricane survivors.\n\n“It may be easy to try to disregard us,” Cruz said. “It may be easy because we’re a U.S. territory and a colony of the United States. But we are people, dammit, and I don’t care what the political status is.”\n\nCruz Soto also slammed Trump’s October visit to Puerto Rico, nearly two weeks after the hurricane made landfall. She criticized the president for tossing paper towels to storm survivors in need of supplies, after the storm left millions of Puerto Ricans without power and limited access to drinking water.\n\nDuring the visit, Trump also downplayed the island’s devastation during a press conference, saying it was not a “real catastrophe like Katrina” in reference to the death toll at the time, 16. Since then, the figure has quadrupled, amid reports from media outlets who’ve looked into the accuracy of the official death count and found that the number dead as a result of the storm is likely more than 1,000.', 'title': 'San Juan Mayor Says Trump Made Hurricane Maria Recovery About Himself', 'url': 'https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/san-juan-mayor-trump-made-hurricane-maria-recovery-about-himself_us_5a57b67ae4b0a57f282c6c8f', 'keywords': ['rico', 'fema', 'cruz', 'trump', 'juan', 'mayor', 'storm', 'recovery', 'maria', 'federal', 'president', 'hurricane', 'san', 'puerto'], 'tags': {"What's Working: Purpose + Profit", 'HuffPost Press Room', 'Social Justice', 'Relationships', 'Carmen Yulín Cruz', 'Podcasts', 'Impact: This New World', 'Donald Trump', 'Natural Disasters', '2018 Elections', 'U.S. News', 'Difference Maker 100', 'The Power of Humanity', 'Outspeak', 'Extremism', 'Puerto Rico', 'Congress', 'Storms', 'Finds', 'Sleep & Wellness', 'Asian Voices', 'Impact: Project Zero'}, 'summary': 'San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz remains one of the most vocal critics of the federal government’s response to Hurricane Maria’s devastation in Puerto Rico.\nIn an interview with Time magazine, published Thursday, Cruz addressed the Trump administration’s “lack of role” in recovery efforts after the storm devastated the U.S. territory in September.\n“The federal government didn’t do things right from the beginning,” the mayor told the magazine.\n“President Trump insulted the Puerto Rican people over and over and over.\n“FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency] was asking Puerto Ricans to go online and register for support.', 'date': 1515708673}, {'text': 'ES News Email Enter your email address Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email cannot be used.

What\'s more, officials say a turf war has broken out among drug gangs looking to grab territory after the storm\'s disruption.\n\n"Hurricanes affect everyone, including criminals," said criminologist Jose Raul Cepeda.\n\nAlready bankrupt, the island\'s overwhelmed government has fallen behind with millions of dollars in overtime payments owed to police officers, who have begun calling in sick in big numbers to protest.\n\nThe protest has taken about 2,000 police off the street each day in a territory that has 13,600 officers. It has forced more than a dozen police stations to close for several hours to a couple of days during the holiday period because of a lack of officers. No arrests have been made in the 32 killings this year.\n\nMaria, which hit as a Category 4 storm, destroyed much of the island\'s electrical grid. For those police on duty, the streets are darker and more dangerous because power has been restored to only 60 percent of customers in the U.S. territory. Drug gangs are fighting to re-establish territory they lost in the disruption from Maria, which pushed thousands from their homes and left entire neighbourhoods uninhabitable for weeks.\n\nHurricane

job, and local and federal authorities are rushing from meeting to meeting to debate how to best protect 3.3 million Puerto Ricans, especially those still living in the dark.\n\n"This has been devastating," said Ramon Santiago, a retiree who lives less than a block from where three bodies were discovered Sunday near a basketball court. "You can\'t sleep peacefully in so much darkness."\n\nPuerto Rico\'s homicide rate is roughly 20 killings per 100,000 residents, compared with 3.7 per 100,000 residents on the U.S. mainland. In the last two years, Puerto Rico has seen an average of 56 homicides a month, a rate that held through December. Then after New Year\'s, the killings started accelerating.\n\nA man was shot Jan. 3 by a security guard while trying to rob a bakery. Two double homicides were reported Jan. 8 - two men found shot to death in a car near an upscale resort on the north coast and two other men discovered sprawled on the street near a public housing complex on the west coast. Five killings alone were reported Monday, in addition to three people wounded by gunfire during a shootout that night in the parking lot of a strip mall in Bayamon. This week, police say, the son of a former judge was killed after trying to write down the license plate number of a car whose occupants were firing a gun.\n\n"The lack of police is increasing Puerto Rico\'s safety issues," said legislator Denis Marquez, who was mugged at gunpoint last month. "Everybody is feeling that insecurity."\n\nBesides policing and getting the lights back on, he said, the government needs to address long-standing issues such as social inequality on an island with a 10 percent unemployment rate, where nearly 45 percent of its inhabitants lived in poverty before the hurricane.\n\nHurricane Maria caused an estimated $95 billion in damage, with 30,000-plus jobs lost in an economy that was already struggling from an 11-year-old recession.\n\nThe last time Puerto Rico saw a spike in violent crime was in 2011, when a record 1,136 killings were reported on an island of nearly 4 million people. Puerto Rico had seen a drop in killings, to 700 in 2016 and 679 last year.\n\nHector Pesquera, secretary of the newly created Department of Public Safety, met this week with top police officials and federal authorities.\n\n"We\'re in a process of analysis and of committed work to fight criminality in Puerto Rico," he said.', 'title': "Number of murders soar in Puerto Rico amid 'lawlessness' following devastation of Hurricane Maria", 'url': 'https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/number-of-murders-soar-in-puerto-rico-amid-lawlessness-following-devastation-of-hurricane-maria-a3738131.html', 'keywords': ['rico', 'number', 'murders', 'hurricane', 'lawlessness', 'following', 'soar', 'devastation', 'guadeloupe', 'french', 'maria', 'caribbean', 'images', 'puerto', 'island', 'afpgetty'], 'tags': {'Pop up', 'Best films', 'Secret London', 'TV reviews', 'News', 'Puerto Rico', 'Festival news'}, 'summary': 'Try another or register with your social accountThe number of murders in Puerto Rico have soared after the devastation wrought by Hurricane Maria sparked "lawlessness".\nIn the last two years, Puerto Rico has seen an average of 56 homicides a month, a rate that held through December.\nHurricane Maria caused an estimated $95 billion in damage, with 30,000-plus jobs lost in an economy that was already struggling from an 11-year-old recession.\nPuerto Rico had seen a drop in killings, to 700 in 2016 and 679 last year.\n"We\'re in a process of analysis and of committed work to fight criminality in Puerto Rico," he said.', 'date': 1515707770}, {'text': 'The rate of suicide increased to nearly a suicide a day in Puerto Rico in November, according to a recent report released by The Commission for the Prevention of Suicide. At least 227 people committed suicide on the island last year, a 16 percent increase compared to 2016, according to the report released Tuesday from the commission, which is part of the Department of Health of Puerto Rico.\n\nAfter Hurricane Maria, 26 people took their own lives in November, or nearly one person a day. The suicide report also found that 85 percent of suicides are committed by men, and 14 percent are committed by women. Many health specialists and doctors said the spike in suicides can be linked to the aftermath of the storm that struck the island on September 20 and the destruction of basic resources like food, water, electricity and housing.\n\n“If someone is in a position where they do not have any electricity, water or a roof over their head, you’re going to either break and sometimes break to the point of committing suicide,” said Alicia Schwartz, a home care nurse from New York City, who volunteered in Puerto Rico through the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) union after Maria hit the island. “You can only live so much without the simple necessities of having a roof over your head.”\n\nDr. Kenira Thompson, who is in charge of providing mental health services at the Ponce Health Sciences University in Puerto Rico, said she has seen a rise in patients since the storm.\n\n“A lot of patients are presenting severe mental health issues since the storm and the number of patients in our clinic has increased dramatically,” said Thompson. “Not one person that has lived through the storm can\'t say they weren’t touched by what happened."\n\nPhoto by Jessica Rinaldi/The Boston Globe via Getty Images\n\nThe clinic, which has been opened for almost 16 years, has largely served mental health patients in Ponce, Puerto Rico to help people dealing with mental health issues, including the emotional and mental problems in the aftermath of the storm. Recently, the clinic has set their efforts on reaching out to people who live in rural areas like in the central mountainous regions of Puerto Rico in the towns of Utado and Cayey, which have all seen an increase in suicides. Many people in these rural towns have gone without power, are not able to get into town and don’t have housing.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\n“A lot of people are still living with tarps over their roofs. We normally have thousands of patients but have seen an increase in patients coming into the facility in rural areas post-Maria. Power is restored in most urban areas, but for rural areas, it\'s as if the storm hit last week,” said Thompson.\n\nHurricane Maria swept through Puerto Rico with 155-mile-per-hour winds and more than 30 inches of rain, leaving a path of death and destruction that officials and locals are still trying to fully cope with. The official death toll is 66, but the island\'s government announced in December that it will recount the fatalities after two independent reports estimated that more than 1,000 people died from diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease with an increase in sepsis, an infection often caused by bacteria.\n\nPuerto Rico\'s Commission for the Prevention of Suicide did not return requests for comments to Newsweek in time for publication.\n\n“One of the problems we have is that Hispanic individuals don’t believe in mental health, but the other issue we have is access to mental health. Those who don’t live in populated cities are unreachable to this day, and they don’t have people to go to them for mental health help,” said Schwartz. She recalled being in a patient’s home a few weeks after the storm and being told by the patient that he “sometimes feels like grabbing a rope” to kill himself.\n\n(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)\n\nAlfredo Carrasquillo, a psychoanalyst and a professor at the University of the Sacred Heart in San Juan, said there isn\'t much help for people living in poverty-stricken communities outside of bigger cities.\n\n"When someone expressed he or she is contemplating suicide, the typical answer is to take this person to the hospital or an institution," said Carrasquillo. "They are given medication and are sent home."\n\nCarrasquillo said the lack of help from the U.S government has also fueled the rise in mental health problems, as many Puerto Ricans feel forgotten.\n\n"Puerto Ricans have always felt that as a people when they are in a crisis, the American government will be there to help us. That has not happened. The response has been slow and terrible, and since [Hurricane Maria], we have felt alone and abandoned," said Carrasquillo.\n\nIt’s not just suicide. Locals are also dealing with other mental health issues, including PTSD, anxiety, and depression. Thompson said clinics like the one in Ponce are doing the best they can to provide mental health assistance for those who come forward, and are also helping them mentally prepare for the next hurricane season, which begins in June.\n\n“Mental health issues will not stop, if you think about the next hurricane season will start again in six months. We will have chaos when the first storm is announced on the news. Hopefully, it\'s not another storm like Maria,” said Thompson.', 'title': 'Puerto Ricans Have Been Committing Suicide Nearly Every Day After Hurricane Maria, A New Report Shows', 'url': 'https://www.newsweek.com/puerto-rico-mental-health-hurricane-maria-us-780062', 'keywords': ['rico', 'ricans', 'day', 'health', 'hurricane', 'suicide', 'mental', 'shows', 'committing', 'patients', 'help', 'storm', 'maria', 'puerto', 'report', 'nearly', 'thompson'], 'tags': {'mental health', 'Hurricane Maria', 'U.S', 'Recommended Slideshows', 'Puerto Rico'}, 'summary': 'The rate of suicide increased to nearly a suicide a day in Puerto Rico in November, according to a recent report released by The Commission for the Prevention of Suicide.\n“One of the problems we have is that Hispanic individuals don’t believe in mental health, but the other issue we have is access to mental health.\nThose who don’t live in populated cities are unreachable to this day, and they don’t have people to go to them for mental health help,” said Schwartz.\nLocals are also dealing with other mental health issues, including PTSD, anxiety, and depression.\n“Mental health issues will not stop, if you think about the next hurricane season will start again in six months.', 'date': 1515848402}, {'text': 'On the path of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico (CNN) Each morning before work, Héctor Luis Rodríguez Nieves showers with a garden hose behind his tattered home. He uses the jungle as his restroom.\n\nHe sleeps on a mattress in what once was the kitchen. Above the bed, clothes hang from the rafters -- like Spanish moss from trees. The floor in his old bedroom turned to cardboard and sags like a trampoline. A hole opened up. Few places in the house stay dry. That\'s because, three months after Hurricane Maria, he still doesn\'t have a functional roof.\n\nOthers might have given up, or moved away, but Rodríguez, a 35-year-old with boyish freckles and a ruler-straight hairline, lived in this house as a child. After his father passed away a few years ago, he says, he moved back in. This is home; he doesn\'t want to leave.\n\nSo he\'s saving up paychecks from his part-time hardware store job to buy cinder blocks to rebuild. A couple dozen or so are piled in the yard. And he tried to install a tarp on his own. It doesn\'t do much.\n\nWhat\'s brought me to Rodríguez\'s house in San Lorenzo, Puerto Rico, on December 16, is none of this. It\'s a yellow piece of paper nailed to the wall, near the front door.\n\nThe Right of Entry Form indicates Rodríguez has applied for a professionally installed tarp -- or Blue Roof -- from the US Army Corps of Engineers. These free roofs, which are meant to last 30 days, may not sound like much. They can be everything in post-hurricane Puerto Rico if you\'re dealing with sun and rain inside your house. Operation Blue Roof is not the only housing program for Maria\'s victims, but it is one of the main ways a person like Rodríguez can protect his belongings and try to return to some semblance of normalcy.\n\nTo qualify, a home must have less than 50% structural damage. Homes with metal or flat roofs, and those made out of concrete, generally are ineligible for the program because of the difficulties of installing tarps on those structures, according to the Army Corps.\n\nOnly about a third of people who requested Blue Roofs had received them by December 18.\n\nRodríguez\'s house was approved for a Blue Roof, according to a government database CNN obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. He said he applied on October 25.\n\nYet, when I visit, he\'s still waiting.\n\nThat\'s true for tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans, the records show.\n\nWhen I ask Rodríguez about the yellow paper on the wall -- the prospect of a tarp -- he brushes off delays, citing the crazy magnitude of Maria. Others have it worse, he says.\n\nThen I show him a photo that, for him, changes everything.\n\nIn December, 20,000 tarp rolls sit idle in a government warehouse.\n\nI took this image on December 13 in Carolina, about 20 miles north of where Rodríguez lives. The photo shows a warehouse filled with about 20,000 tarp rolls -- each representing at least one house, like his, without a roof. There\'s another warehouse like this in Ponce, to the south. That one holds 40,000 tarps, according to Mike Feldmann, temporary roofing mission manager for the Army Corps of Engineers, who gave me a tour of the Carolina warehouse.\n\nMore than 70,000 people like Rodríguez requested Blue Roofs between the day Hurricane Maria hit and December 18, according to a CNN analysis of Army Corps data.\n\nTens of thousands of Puerto Ricans are still waiting for temporary roofs -- three months later.\n\nYet only about one third — less than 25,000 — had received them by that date, the analysis shows.\n\nThe Army Corps\' own guidelines say homeowners "should expect work within 14 days of the request." However, following inquiries from CNN, agency officials acknowledge the database used to track the work does not show how long residents have been waiting for tarps.\n\nThe Army Corps could look at paper records to determine how long applicants have been put on hold, an agency spokesperson says. But the agency declined to say whether such an assessment has been done. Blue Roof installations, according to the spokesperson, are prioritized by location and other factors, not by the date a person applied for a tarp.\n\n"God would cry over this injustice," Rodríguez says.\n\n"Our mission is to install temporary roofs on all eligible structures as quickly as possible," Patrick Loch, an agency spokesman, says in an email. "Our priority is to maximize the rate of installations across the entire island, and ensure each installation meets the program quality standards. The number of temporary roofs remaining to be installed, along with their location, is the information we use on a daily basis to drive execution of the program."\n\nAs for the room full of tarps?\n\n"That warehouse full of roofs is evidence that we\'ve been able to overcome at least one part of that challenge," which was bringing tarps to the island, says Feldmann, the mission manager. Difficult working conditions in Puerto Rico, including unsafe structures, also contribute to the slowdown, he says. "We\'ve done everything we can to address every challenge when we have discovered it and experienced it. There\'s always things that you can do better and as we learn about a new challenge we find every opportunity to make it more efficient."\n\nIt doesn\'t seem that way to Rodríguez, who\'s still waiting for a roof.\n\n"I\'m speechless," he says, looking at the image of the warehouse. "The Army is immensely big, and there are many people with many talents who know how to work in situations like this.\n\n"God would cry over this injustice."\n\n• • • • •\n\nTwo days before I met Rodríguez, I started driving the route the eye of Hurricane Maria bulldozed across Puerto Rico. I\'d already spent weeks reporting on conditions after the storm -- on people desperately searching for clean drinking water ; on the likely undercounting of deaths related to Maria and the storm\'s aftermath . I wanted to see for myself whether life was returning to normal anywhere along Hurricane Maria\'s disastrous path.\n\nIn particular, I wanted to know whether people still were living without shelter.\n\nCNN followed the path of Hurricane Maria across Puerto Rico.\n\nI already knew that tens of thousands were waiting for Blue Roofs in Puerto Rico. And I knew that contracting issues at the Army Corps had slowed the installation of tarps. The Corps had told me as of December 6 that only 26% of Blue Roofs requested had been installed. I didn\'t know, however, where the temporary roofs were being installed or how long people were waiting. In the void, I decided to try to follow Hurricane Maria\'s path across Puerto Rico. I wanted to survey housing conditions overall -- not just the Blue Roof program.\n\nMaria\'s eye flew about 70 miles -- through plantain fields and stegosaurus-ridged mountains, shanty towns and pastel cities -- in roughly eight hours on September 20.\n\n"Right now, people don\'t have hope."\n\nIt would take me about a week in a rented minivan to follow the same route. I set out on December 14. I would hit closed roads and downed bridges. I would see repairs being made but also dozens of houses like Rodríguez\'s that were shells of their former selves. I would meet a baby born after Maria and, later, the relatives of a woman who died in the aftermath.\n\nI begin in Yabucoa, on the southeast coast.\n\nThis is where Maria made landfall at 6:15 a.m. with 155 mph winds.\n\nThree months later, you don\'t have to search hard for problems.\n\nPuerto Rico is a US territory home to 3.4 million Americans.\n\nOn the shore, I find a family of five living in a home without a roof.\n\nThey have a dog named Snickers and two threadbare horses.\n\nLoose tarps cover about half of the structure, but Luis Oscar Morales Martinez, 36, and his wife stay awake all night when it rains, he says, holding broomsticks against the blue plastic; they are human tent poles, trying to keep water from spilling into the single bedroom where they all sleep. Other rooms are open to the sky entirely, leaving rain and tropical sun to rot and warp the toys of their son and two daughters, ages 9, 10 and 15. The two youngest have all but stopped speaking because of the trauma of the storm, their father tells me. I ask one her name and she motions for my pen. "Jailyn," she writes without a word.\n\n"It\'s not easy," her father says, resigned.\n\nA neighbor tells me this journey will not be easy, either.\n\n"Right now," he says, "people don\'t have hope."\n\n• • • • •\n\nI drive from the coast into the mountains.\n\nThe interior of Puerto Rico generally is the most damaged and least accessible. The valleys and river deltas near the coast grow into lumpy mountain ridges. My ears pop. I come to a spot marked "Carretera Cerrada." Road Closed. Workers say to keep driving anyway.\n\nIt can be difficult to reconcile the conflicting messages coming out of Puerto Rico. A utility pole has fallen on a home; the family decorated it with tinsel for Christmas. There are crews untangling power cables, but about 40% of power customers remain without electricity, according to the Puerto Rican government. Many buildings -- especially the concrete ones -- are standing in Puerto Rico. But that fact only underscores the stark class divisions on the island. Poorer people tend to live in wooden houses, and many of those structures were stripped bare by the 91 mph wind gusts that tore through the highlands here.\n\nCarmen Torres lives with her sister across the street from her tattered home.\n\nWhat remains, often, is a wooden skeleton.\n\nIn a basement lives José Ángel Gómez Ortiz, age 63. The second story of the property was damaged in the storm, and now water pours down through empty light sockets.\n\nBlack-colored mold grows on the walls.\n\nGómez tells me that after living in these conditions he\'s developed a deep chest cough and a rash on his body. He shows me red splotches on his arms. "It itches," he says.\n\n"Because of their delay, I fell and broke my arm."\n\nIn a bedroom, stuffed animals are piled on a bed.\n\nAre there children living here?\n\nNo, he says, they moved to the continental United States with their mom, his daughter, after the storm.\n\nHis brother and sister-in-law moved away, too, he says. After the storm, his brother was living in a school bus because his nearby home had been virtually destroyed, Gómez tells me, walking outside and pointing at the bus downhill. Its nose is demolished. The yellow vehicle\'s hue is conspicuous against the greens and browns of the surrounding hillside.\n\nDo you want to move to the mainland?\n\n"I\'m not going to leave what I have here just to go somewhere else."\n\n• • • • •\n\nFarther inland, in Comerío, another yellow paper.\n\nThis one on the home of Carmen Rivera.\n\nThat paper -- which allows workers to install a Blue Roof -- has been there for two months, she says, far longer than the two weeks the Army Corps guidelines suggest. It\'s hard to say exactly when she requested the tarp because the Army Corps says its own database is unreliable -- and because her yellow form was not filled out completely.\n\nRubble is piled along the roughly 70-mile path Maria took across the island.\n\nOther forms I saw on the drive were so faded by sun and rain they\'d become illegible.\n\n"Unfortunately, we have found that sometimes the yellow forms posted at a residence get wet, the ink bleeds and is eventually no longer visible," says Loch, the agency spokesman. "It was recommended to residents that they post in a visible but protected area and/or place them in a clear plastic binder sleeve."\n\nI first met Rivera in October. She told me then that she\'d broken her arm while trying to sweep water out of her living room. It was raining and dark, and water seemed to be everywhere in her home that night. Raindrops rippled across the floor. A cast was on her left arm.\n\nHer home is right on the route the hurricane\'s eye took across Puerto Rico.\n\nWhen I see her again, on December 16, her roof is still damaged.\n\nRelatives helped install a tarp over part of the property, but water creeps across the floor and her arm is still in the cast. She\'s strapped a purple, plastic glove over her hand to try to keep the arm dry. Paperwork shows a doctor did surgery on December 12.\n\nCarmen Rivera says she broke her arm sweeping water out of her living room.\n\n"I\'m in a lot of pain," she says, clutching a sling.\n\nShe sobs inconsolably, shaking, her eyes bloodshot.\n\nShe looks up.\n\n"Please don\'t forget me."\n\n• • • • •\n\nI post about that encounter on Twitter, where I\'m keeping an open journal of sorts, under the hashtag #LaRutaDeMaria . Among those who take an interest: The Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nI tag them in a few posts, and they start writing back, providing stats on the Blue Roof program and tweeting the number -- 1-888-ROOF-BLU -- that people can call to sign up for help.\n\nI don\'t give the interactions much thought -- until I return to see Rivera.\n\nI double back because my last conversation with her haunted me.\n\nThat morning, Rivera is standing on the porch smoking a cigarette, watching the occasional car struggle up the steep incline that leads to her neighborhood.\n\nA professionally installed tarp sits on top of her home -- a blue roof.\n\nThree months after the storm, Manuel Morales still lives in an ad hoc shelter with his wife.\n\nShe says it was installed on December 17, the day after my visit. Loch, the Army Corps spokesman, calls the timing of the installation a "fantastic coincidence."\n\nRivera doesn\'t buy it.\n\nThe publicity led them to come, after weeks of waiting, she says.\n\n"It\'s so frustrating that I had to wait so long. Because of their delay, I fell and broke my arm."\n\nAnd that\'s the thing about shelter: The wait truly matters.\n\n• • • • •\n\nFarther into the mountains, in Orocovis, I meet a family that already has a Blue Roof.\n\nThe tarp was installed about a month ago, they say. Until then, however, they\'d been living in a home where water dripped on them at night and mold inched up the walls.\n\nKarla Zayas, a 23-year-old with big brown eyes, frizzy hair at the temples and rosary beads around her neck, was pregnant when the storm hit. She gave birth to a marshmallow-cheeked son, Sebastian, on November 18, nearly two months after Maria barreled through.\n\n"It seems like they forgot us."\n\nThe morning I stop for an interview, the baby is in the hospital with respiratory problems, according to medical records. It\'s the newborn\'s second trip to the hospital with those issues, his family tells me. In all, they say, he has spent 10 days in the hospital. Karla\'s father, Carmelo Zayas, says he was hospitalized for nine days with similar problems. And a 4-year-old child in the house also was hospitalized for five days with respiratory issues, they say.\n\nMedical records do not state specifically whether the wet living conditions contributed to the illness. But Paula Schenck, who directs indoor environments and health programs at the University of Connecticut, says wet and moldy environments can pose "very serious" health risks, including respiratory illnesses. Installing a tarp may not solve the problems, she says in an email. Water-damaged materials may also need to be replaced.\n\nBaby and mom arrive while I\'m talking with the rest of the group.\n\nKarla Zayas says she feared for her son\'s life.\n\n"He\'s a baby -- a very small baby," she says, "and I was afraid his system was not going to be strong enough to defend himself from conditions like this."\n\nThe Blue Roof is nice, says Carmelo Zayas, but it came far too late.\n\n"I do think we got ill because of the delays."\n\n• • • • •\n\nOthers have not survived the conditions Maria left.\n\nIn Corozal, Pilar Guzmán Ríos died on September 29 without the power she needed to run an oxygen machine and without adequate refrigeration for her insulin, according to family members. Calls to an ambulance didn\'t yield help because of closed roads and downed communication networks, they say. The woman\'s sister and brother-in-law, Paula Guzmán and Manuel Morales, are still living nearby in a makeshift shelter, a closed elementary school. They power a light bulb with a car battery and sleep on beds hidden by purple curtains. I met them on a previous trip and decide to return to see how they are doing.\n\nMorales says he and Paula Guzmán -- whose eyes are sunken and who speaks only in a whisper -- could move back into their home if only they had a roof, or even a tarp.\n\nCarmen Torres\' clock froze at 3:27 the afternoon Maria hit.\n\nA yellow paper is tacked to the wall of the house, which is just down the street from the shelter. "They left me waiting," Morales says. "These guys said they would come in a week or two. It\'s been more than one month since (then). It seems like they forgot us."\n\nMorales shows me the home, popping shutters to let out the stench of mildew. A ceiling fan droops like a wilted flower. Images of Mother Mary and Jesus stare blankly across the room.\n\nI ask him where they\'ll be in three more months, a year.\n\nHe seems unable to think in those terms.\n\nWhen they moved into the shelter, he says, he thought it would be for just a week or two.\n\nNow they\'re beginning month three.\n\nHe wants his family to think he\'s fine. "But I\'m not OK," he tells me.\n\n"There\'s nothing better than your own home."\n\n• • • • •\n\nFederal Emergency Management Agency offices. Guaynabo, Puerto Rico.\n\nTwo press officers sit me down across a wide conference table from Justo Hernandez, FEMA\'s deputy federal coordinating officer here.\n\nI tell him some of what I\'ve seen.\n\nHow is it possible so many people don\'t have their needs met when it comes to housing?\n\nThe island poses unique challenges, Hernandez says.\n\nOther hurricanes have devastated parts of Puerto Rico, he says, but Maria hit all of it.\n\n"This one impacted the whole island -- completely," he says. "When we\'re working with 3.4 million people, we\'re working with every municipality heavily impacted. We\'re working with local utilities. We\'re working with the loss of the whole communications system in the island and the infrastructure was heavily impacted then. That complicates the recovery process."\n\nJosé Ángel Gómez Ortiz\'s family moved to the mainland United States because of the condition of his home.\n\nHernandez provides a verbal list of some ways FEMA is helping.\n\nThe agency has distributed 169,000 tarps to municipalities across Puerto Rico for self-installation, he says on December 18. That\'s in addition to the Army Corps\' Blue Roof program. The number of shelters, which are managed by the Puerto Rican Department of Housing, is down considerably, to 39, with 551 people living in them, he says; others are being transitioned to better housing. FEMA can help pay motel bills for those displaced by the storm, including those who move to the mainland US. There\'s even a program that would pay to move people there. When we talk, no one has taken advantage of it, though, according to a FEMA spokesman.\n\nThey don\'t want to leave, he says.\n\nI\'ve met people who do want to leave, but who say the process has been too difficult or unclear to them -- or that they were unaware this FEMA program exists.\n\n"God would cry over this injustice."\n\nWhat about trailers?\n\nFEMA trailers are fixtures of hurricane response in the United States.\n\nHurricane season returns in six months, Hernandez says.\n\n"We\'re an island. When you have 175 mph winds, that trailer is not going to survive."\n\nHe also cites logistical and potentially cost-related problems with this form of housing. Trailers can be driven to states on the mainland, but "here you have to put them on barges."\n\nDelivering temporary trailers to Puerto Rico "is going to be, first of all, inadequate," he says. "It\'s going to be unsafe for the families because I\'m putting them in harm\'s way. And so we decided to then use other forms of assistance here."\n\nI still don\'t get it, I tell him. I\'m meeting people who, three months later, are living without roofs, or without solid ones. It rains on them at night. How is this happening?\n\n"You can find the people that are living through that," he tells me, referring to unsafe conditions, "but you can also find thousands and thousands and thousands of people that got their money, that got their assistance -- they got their Blue Roof in place. They\'ve got their own tarps in place; (they) went after the mayor to ask for help; (they) called FEMA and maintained contact with FEMA to get the systems that they provide.\n\n"I mean, you can find thousands of cases like that."\n\nThat\'s true, but not for the majority of people who have applied for Blue Roofs. Our analysis of federal data would find only about one third of applicants had received Blue Roofs by December 18. Again, that\'s about 25,000 installations out of more than 70,000 requests.\n\nUS Army Corps of Engineers contractors install temporary tarps -- or "Blue Roofs" -- after natural disasters.\n\nThose numbers track with information provided to us by the Army Corps press office.\n\nHernandez says some responsibility rests with storm victims.\n\n"I can tell you the one thing that I tell every survivor," he says. "\'What are you doing to take ownership of your situation? What are you doing to assist us in assisting you? Are you waiting for stuff to happen to you? What is it that you\'re proactively doing for yourself?\'"\n\nMany people without adequate shelter, he says, are squatters. "We still have shelters open," he says. "So there\'s no reason why they\'re living in those conditions."\n\nI relay some of these comments to Carmelo Zayas, the man who was hospitalized and whose newborn grandson was hospitalized after weeks of wet conditions.\n\nHe bristles at the suggestion survivors are to blame.\n\n"I moved Earth and heaven," he says. "I\'ve done everything possible to get help."\n\nStill, he says, mold keeps growing on the walls.\n\n"After I clean it, it comes right back," he says. "And it\'s spreading."\n\n• • • • •\n\nGovernment warehouse. Carolina, Puerto Rico.\n\nMike Feldmann, from the Army Corps, looks across that sea of 20,000 tarps and tells me that this is a sign that supplies are here and work is happening in Puerto Rico.\n\nafter the company failed to deliver tarps to the island. Contracting issues and other bureaucratic missteps have plagued the delivery and installation of tarps in Puerto Rico. The Federal Emergency Management Agency in November fired Bronze Star, a Florida company it had hired to deliver tarps to the island, according to the Associated Press after the company failed to deliver tarps to the island.\n\nThe Blue Roof program provides free tarp installation for homes that are less than 50% damaged.\n\nThat contracting issue did not slow down the work of distributing tarps, Hernandez says.\n\nHe says there are enough tarps on the island to meet needs.\n\nSeparately, the Army Corps slowed work on the installation of Blue Roofs for at least nine days, a spokesman says, because of a bid dispute over a government contract -- a dispute first reported by CNN . Two attorneys specializing in federal contracts told me there was no compelling reason for the Army Corps to slow its work installing tarps during that dispute, which involved a company, Venegas, claiming that the government had unlawfully given work to a non-Puerto Rican competitor. The Army Corps could have made a simple legal case for continuing work while the dispute was being resolved, they said, especially given the humanitarian emergency in Puerto Rico.\n\nIn the end, Venegas got a slice of the contract, and work resumed full-tilt on December 13, says Loch, the Army Corps spokesman. But the Corps has estimated about 400 temporary roofs per day went uninstalled during that nine-day period -- so approximately 3,600 roofs in total. The Corps was installing about 500 Blue Roofs per day in mid-December.\n\nTens of thousands of Puerto Ricans are still waiting for Blue Roofs.\n\n"Ideally, these roofs go up the day after the storm hits, but as we have said many times the level of devastation here, the challenges to getting personnel in a position to assess houses, award contracts and get those workers up to speed in terms of installing blue roofs on unique structures has been tremendous," Loch says in an email.\n\n"We continue to increase the number of roofs installed every day, and will continue to do so until every resident eligible for the temporary roofing has a Blue Roof installed."\n\nThe Corps\' contractors have about 1,500 workers per day installing tarps, he says.\n\nThe project\'s budget is $200 million.\n\nFEMA says it has approved more than $880 million for individual and household assistance.\n\n• • • • •\n\nMeanwhile, tens of thousands are waiting for help from the Army Corps and others.\n\nThere\'s the retired roofer with a physical disability. He\'d like to fix his own roof but can\'t because of his hip. While he waits for assistance, the mattress upstairs has become so saturated with water that touching it releases a virtual flood. He sleeps in the living room. There\'s no power to run the oxygen machine he needs for nighttime breathing treatments.\n\nThen there\'s the family in Barranquitas with a 5-year-old boy. His mother\'s home was destroyed in the storm, and other family members were displaced. They show me the boy\'s Christmas list for Santa: "I would like a motorcycle and something for construction."\n\nAt a shelter in Manatí: George Rivera, 60, says he became so depressed after the storm that he tried to drive his SUV off a cliff in his hometown. He\'s doing better now, he says, but his wife has cancer and they plan to move to Alabama to be with family, when they find tickets.\n\nDown the street, Luis Rodríguez Ortiz, 47, spend his work days collecting sewage from septic tanks. Little by little, Puerto Rico will return to its old self, he tells me. It won\'t be fast, but you have to keep working at it. Meanwhile, there\'s no wall on the back of his house.\n\nA yellow Right of Entry form may indicate a person has applied for a Blue Roof.\n\nIn Morovis, a mother and daughter, ages 87 and 58, sleep in the same bed. They\'ve taped a few photos to the plywood wall -- black-and-white images of better times. The ceiling drips at night, they say. They\'re among the thousands waiting for a Blue Roof. Their neighbor got one, but she tells me it was only half-installed. The workers said they\'d be back, she says, but that was two weeks before my visit, and by then they hadn\'t returned.\n\nNot far from there, a woman lives with her sister because her home doesn\'t have rafters, much less a roof. When "I feel like I\'m losing myself," Carmen Torres says, she lies down on a couch in the only dry spot in her old home and sobs.\n\nFor some, it feels Maria never left, like the storm is still pummeling them day after day.\n\nAcross the room from Torres, a clock is stopped.\n\n3:27.\n\n• • • • •\n\nI descend from the mountains toward the northwest coast where the eye of Hurricane Maria left this island on the afternoon of September 20. It\'s a place of extremes, like much of Puerto Rico. The mountains give way to fertile valleys where cows roam -- and where pharmaceuticals are manufactured. Fast-food restaurants are open; some homes don\'t have walls.\n\nIn Hatillo, just after sunset, I arrive at roughly the spot on the map where Hurricane Maria left the land and coasted into the Atlantic Ocean. It\'s hard to find the beach at first amid the suburban sprawl — neat concrete homes with symmetrical driveways. It feels like San Diego. I ask directions, and a family points me down the street and around a bend to the beach.\n\nI want to see where the hurricane\'s path ends.\n\nI spot two headlamps scanning the shoreline.\n\nIt\'s two fishermen. They\'re trying to catch food for their families.\n\nI sit in the sand to watch.\n\nThe route Maria took starts in Yabucoa, shown, and ends near Hatillo, in the northwest.\n\nI think back on the drive, straining to imagine these post-hurricane conditions lingering in such a widespread way in any US state -- Florida to Hawaii. I think about Sebastian, the baby born after the storm, and Pilar, who died in its aftermath; about Carmen with her broken arm, and Héctor saving money for cinder blocks. How many months will it take him to rebuild on his wages? Others have lost jobs because of Maria and have few prospects for regaining them. Puerto Rico was in financial free fall -- the government in bankruptcy -- before the storm.\n\nNow it\'s anyone\'s guess what\'s left.\n\nCongress in October approved a $36.5 billion aid package for natural disasters, including Hurricane Maria. But critics say the response has been too little too late.\n\n"We can\'t fail to note the dissimilar urgency and priority given to the emergency response in Puerto Rico, compared to the US states affected by hurricanes in recent months," Leilani Farha, the United Nations special rapporteur on the right to housing, said in October\n\n"After a natural disaster, with around 90,000 homes totally destroyed, people are at their most vulnerable. It\'s the obligation of all levels of government to act to protect them, and to ensure that lives can return to some normality quickly."\n\nThe 3.4 million Americans living in Puerto Rico have little political recourse. The island is a United States commonwealth. It\'s home to citizens who, unlike those on the mainland, cannot vote in general presidential elections and have no voting representative in Congress.\n\n"I moved Earth and heaven. I\'ve done everything possible to get help."\n\nThis is a territory in limbo -- neither state nor nation.\n\nA place that\'s been made to wait.\n\nI stay with the fishermen for an hour before, finally, a bite.\n\nOne of them runs to the shore, tugs on the wooden rod.\n\nIt\'s a struggle, but he drops a fish -- big as my shin -- in the beam of the headlamp.\n\nThis is a ray-finned fish, he says. Too spiny to eat.\n\nHe throws it back into the ocean.\n\nI wait another hour before asking: How long do you stay out here fishing?\n\nAs long as it takes, they say.\n\nSometimes, all night.\n\nPostscript: As of January 1, 2018, 30,580 people had received Blue Roofs in Puerto Rico, according to the US Army Corps press office.

Hurricane Maria, which blew in at 155 miles per hour on Sept. 20, caused more than $90 billion in damage, according to estimates by local officials. That was on top of a decade-long recession that had already decimated the local economy and driven more than 400,000 (Spanish) Puerto Ricans out of the island.\n\nTwo months after the storm, more than half of the island remains without power and debris is yet to be collected in some places.\n\nBut what jumped out to me during a recent trip was what still stands. The Caribbean is the same gorgeous turquoise hue. The island remains covered in tropical lushness—even trees maimed by Maria are now putting out green shoots.\n\nRaquel Pérez Puig for Quartz The trees left bare by Maria are now covered in the green fuzz of new leaves.\n\nThe same can be said of Puerto Ricans. Everywhere I went, I saw people pushing through Maria’s pall with determination—and surprisingly good humor. The bar owner who’s operating at a loss so his customers have a place to drink a cold beer; the university student who somehow, amid spotty to inexistent phone service, is tracking down senior citizens to hand-deliver water filters; the butcher who crosses a river on a self-fabricated zip line to get to work everyday.\n\nI was in Puerto Rico for six days, and I visited only a handful of municipalities, so what I have are anecdotes, not hard statistics. It’s tough to tell to what extent the pluck I witnessed will turn up in Puerto Rico’s gross domestic product or job figures a few months from now. Still, it shouldn’t be discounted either. Puerto Ricans’ stubborn resilience is as important as the slew of bad news that many reporters—including myself—have been focusing on for the past two months.\n\nThose who stay\n\nWhile record numbers of Puerto Ricans are ditching the island in the wake of the hurricane, many are clinging to it ferociously. No one would blame Iván Sotomayor for buying a plane ticket out of his tiny rural community, which was isolated after Maria destroyed the road that led to it. Instead, his family built a zip line out of a shipping pallet and $300’s worth of hardware store supplies.\n\nZipping across the river is just one leg of Sotomayor’s daily trek to his job as a supermarket butcher. He also has to climb down a hill, and then coast down another on a bicycle.\n\nRaquel Pérez Puig for Quartz Iván Sotomayor is staying put.\n\nSotomayor makes the return trip in the dark, after the end of his shift at 11 pm. In his downtime, he’s helping his father build a hydroelectric turbine out of the interior of a washing machine.\n\n“We like our way of life. We want to stay here,” he said.\n\nOfficial flurry\n\nOfficial responses to Maria, both at the federal and local level, have been criticized as slow and inept, not without reason. But I also found examples of the opposite on a recent Sunday in Utuado, a municipality heavily hit by Maria. Angel Pérez, a regional director for the Puerto Rico Emergency Management Agency, was coordinating a flurry of recovery activity from a trailer in the parking lot of his hurricane-damaged office.\n\nMembers of the US corps of engineers were assessing downed bridges; national guardsmen were cleaning roads; public utility workers were repairing broken electric lines; there was even a border patrol agent lugging supplies for stranded families.\n\nRaquel Pérez Puig for Quartz Authorities are making some progress in recovery efforts. Here, work on a temporary bridge that will reconnect several families isolated by Maria with the rest of Utuado.\n\nAlong with the vast hurricane damage, Pérez has been dealing with its human fallout. That includes tasks such as sleuthing the whereabouts of the son of an elderly man who can no longer live on his own after the storm. Pérez finally found him in Texas, though the son said he wouldn’t be able to collect his dad for several weeks. In the meantime, it’s Pérez’s agency that’s keeping an eye on him.\n\nPérez, who had a bad cold and a son in the hospital he had not yet visited, did not sugarcoat the scope of the catastrophe, or offer any optimistic deadlines for recovery. “Maria changed the destiny of all Puerto Ricans in an instant,” he said.\n\nJoy in the blackout\n\nThe trauma of the apocalyptic days after Maria is still fresh. Mention the storm’s name to a Puerto Rican who endured it, and you will get a detailed account of the harrowing experience. But the next second they might show you the latest hurricane-related meme. A local favorite: A line of electric utility trucks reading “Puerto Rican porn.”\n\nRaquel Pérez Puig for Quartz Many Puerto Ricans are putting a good face on Maria.\n\nThe party goes on, with or without grid power. At the Old San Juan hotel where I stayed, the only lit doorway for blocks, guests and locals gathered every night around a grill set up in the street. They ate hotdogs and ribs, and drank miraculously cold beer.\n\nFor Halloween, some donned scary face paint, courtesy of the owner. In between the sweaty logistics of keeping the generator-powered lights on, he had the foresight to get a make-up artist for the kids, and kids at heart.\n\nA future\n\nOf course, you can’t run a successful economy on diesel generators or high spirits. The pre-Maria problems were not washed away by the storm either. Puerto Rico is still $74 billion in debt.\n\nNevertheless, many Puerto Ricans are doubling their bets on their island’s future post-Maria.\n\nRaquel Pérez Puig for Quartz The hurricane inspired many Puerto Ricans to do more for their island. Here, a volunteer loads supplies to deliver in Adjuntas.\n\nNatalia Arcila, a 24 year-old biology student, had planned to study abroad after getting her bachelor’s degree. She was about to start her last semester when Maria swept through.\n\nShe’s taking her last classes outdoors and without a computer, but she’s decided to stay. For now, aside from going to school, she’s working with a local non-profit, Foundation for Puerto Rico, to distribute water filters. Once she graduates, she wants to help restore Maria’s environmental damage, and protect Puerto Rico from the hurricanes that will surely follow.\n\n“This island is a paradise,” she says.

He sold hardware from the wooden bed of the pickup. And he used those tools, and a lifetime of sweat, to build houses -- always in concrete.\n\nLike him, the material was nothing if not consistent. It was strong enough to stand up to a storm, he told clients and family members. Don\'t trust anything less durable.\n\nAfter Hurricane Maria slammed into this US territory on September 20, peeling roofs from wooden homes and amputating branches from trees, the community turned again to Vidal. No one can say exactly how many people survived the storm in the hard-cast structures he helped construct for them, often at little or no cost. But it\'s likely hundreds, his family said.\n\nThe man who would have been 90 years old in February survived the storm at home alone. Shortly after, he was seen by neighbors clearing debris from roads and flooded houses.\n\nIt was the aftermath of the hurricane that would prove fatal.\n\nNo one thought much of the lantern at first. Some neighbors noticed the oil-powered flame flickering in Vidal\'s living room. He\'d started using it after the storm hit -- a light he lit at dusk, as the coquí frogs began their chorus. Maria\'s winds had toppled power lines like toothpicks in Cayey; and power service in the town, like on much of the island, has been slow to return amid a government response widely described as inadequate. Only 10% of people here have power today, said Mayor Rolando Ortiz. Vidal needed a way to see in the dark.\n\nIt was October 20, one month after the storm, when the neighbors smelled smoke.\n\nDaisy Lamboy stood on her roof, straining to find cellular signal to call emergency responders. Margarita León busted through Vidal\'s window, releasing a mushroom of heat. It was too late. Vidal\'s charred remains were found in a blackened "hellscape," as one relative described it -- a scene so otherworldly, and so seemingly unnecessary, that one firefighter, Vidal\'s nephew, fainted.\n\nSeveral of Vidal\'s siblings, children and grandchildren, as well as Cayey\'s mayor, the police chief and the director of emergency management -- all say Vidal died as a result of the power outages caused by Hurricane Maria, and that have lingered for nearly two months.\n\nIf he\'d had power, he wouldn\'t have been using the lantern with the open flame.\n\nAnd if he hadn\'t used that lantern, he\'d still be alive, they said.\n\nOne family member described Quintín Vidal Rolón\'s home on October 20 as a "hellscape."\n\nIn general, "indirect" hurricane deaths -- in which a person likely would be alive if not for the storm and its aftermath -- should be part of the official death toll, according to Puerto Rico\'s Department of Public Safety, which oversees the count. The list of 55 deaths attributed to the hurricane includes ones from heart attacks and suicides that were precipitated by a storm that shook even the sturdiest of the 3.4 million American citizens who live on this Caribbean island.\n\nYet Vidal\'s death -- and potentially dozens if not hundreds of others -- is yet to be counted by Puerto Rico as it creates a list of mortalities related to the Category 4 storm.\n\nWe spent two weeks in Puerto Rico trying to understand why.\n\nThe trip included a survey of about half of all funeral homes on the island, which showed the potential for widespread undercounting; interviews with doctors and public officials; and, most importantly, conversations with the family members of Puerto Rico\'s uncounted dead.\n\nThe analysis of the death toll found problems that start at the time of death and continue beyond the grave.\n\n\'The official count is 55\'\n\nWhen President Donald Trump visited Puerto Rico on October 3, he praised Hurricane Maria\'s relatively low death toll -- then 16. Officials should be proud of the low number of deaths, and for avoiding a "real catastrophe" like 2005\'s Hurricane Katrina, Trump said. Later that day, however, Puerto Rico\'s death toll rose to 34.\n\nSince then, politicians, academics and news outlets, including CNN, have raised questions about the accuracy of the official Hurricane Maria death toll in Puerto Rico. A storm as powerful as Maria would be expected to kill hundreds of people, not dozens, said John Mutter, a professor at Columbia University who reviewed deaths after Hurricane Katrina. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz told CNN\'s Jake Tapper on November 3 she thought the toll could be 500.\n\nJUST WATCHED Puerto Rico\'s uncounted Hurricane Maria deaths Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Puerto Rico\'s uncounted Hurricane Maria deaths 05:44\n\nThe Puerto Rican government fired back at that estimate.\n\n"In order to support her statement, [Cruz] needs to present the evidence," Héctor M. Pesquera, secretary of the Department of Public Safety, said in a statement. "If she is not willing to do such, it is an irresponsible comment. The government of Puerto Rico certifies the death count based on factual information in concert with all components involved in the process. At the moment, the official death count is 55."\n\nTo check the accuracy of the Puerto Rican government\'s figures, we called nearly every funeral home in Puerto Rico. Funeral home directors are on the front lines of this crisis -- they count the dead and they speak with family members about the circumstances. It was through a funeral home director, for instance, that we learned of Vidal\'s death and others.\n\nSome funeral homes did not answer our calls, and several declined to provide data. CNN was able to collect responses from 112 of the island\'s funeral homes. That\'s about half the total number in Puerto Rico, according to Eduardo Cardona, director of the Puerto Rico Association of Funeral Home Directors. (The Puerto Rican Department of Health said it was unable to provide us with a comprehensive list of all funeral homes on the island, saying the computer systems that contain those documents remain down because of the storm).\n\nThose funeral homes identified 499 deaths in the month after the storm -- September 20 to October 19 -- which they say were related to Hurricane Maria and its aftermath. That\'s nine times the official death toll. And, again, it represents only about half of funeral homes.\n\nOne funeral home director, José A. Molina, in Vega Alta, was so overwhelmed by work after the storm that he died of a heart attack on October 10, according to his son, Luis Alberto Molina. The 31-year-old said his father was under tremendous stress as he tried to run a sanitary business without reliable power or water service. José Molina had to wait in hourslong lines for fuel, his son said. Before the storm, he had high blood pressure but otherwise was in good health, Luis Alberto Molina said. His color and temperament changed. He stopped eating and sleeping. Eventually he complained of chest pains and was taken to the hospital. His son, who now manages the business, the Vega Alta Memorial Funeral Home, handled his father\'s services.\n\n"Me and my siblings are going to continue his legacy," he said.\n\nWe asked the funeral home directors to consult their records before providing these estimates. Yes, they are subjective. All official hurricane deaths in Puerto Rico must be certified by a single office at the Bureau of Forensic Sciences in San Juan, the capital. Funeral home directors are not trained pathologists, and do not conduct autopsies and other tests. They do, however, speak with family members and review death certificates and bodies.\n\nSurveying funeral homes likely underestimates the number of hurricane deaths, said Eric Klinenberg, director of New York University\'s Institute for Public Knowledge, who wrote a book that dealt with problems with death tolls following a 1995 heat wave in Chicago.\n\n"The cases where you have the body and the body gets taken to the funeral home almost always understate the real mortality," he said. "There\'s always a significant number of bodies that don\'t get processed through funeral homes. What that tells me (is that) there are a lot more cases to be reported -- and that number is probably going to spike again."\n\nThe most objective way to estimate the number of hurricane deaths, he said, is to look at how many people died in a normal month in Puerto Rico -- and then compare that to the number of deaths during the month of the hurricane. By that measure, 472 more people died in September 2017 than September 2016 , according to Puerto Rico\'s Demographic Registry.\n\nSan Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz has criticized the official death count.\n\nThe Puerto Rican government stands by its count as accurate, based on the factual information it has received to date. Reports from funeral homes and families are simply "rumors," said Mónica Menéndez, deputy director of the Bureau of Forensic Sciences, which examines deaths to determine if they are hurricane-related.\n\n"There\'s no reason for us to be hiding numbers," she said.\n\n"We work with what we\'ve received and we\'ve analyzed it. And my personnel work hard to do this. ... It hurts us to hear people think we might be playing around with the numbers."\n\n\'Even the cats prayed for Pilar\'\n\nProblems with the Hurricane Maria tally begin as soon as deaths occur.\n\nHospitals and doctors often are the first line of defense. These medical professionals sign death certificates and, in many cases, decide whether the death is sent to the Bureau of Forensic Sciences in San Juan for investigation. A death must be reviewed by that office to be counted.\n\nOf the 1,968 total deaths reported to us by funeral homes -- 499 of which they claimed were hurricane-related -- 601 deaths, they said, were sent to the forensics lab for analysis. The Puerto Rican government received a total of 843 deaths for analysis in the first month after the storm, according to Menéndez, from the forensics bureau; of those, 377 were visually examined but not autopsied, she said, because the deaths resulted from natural causes.\n\nFive cases are pending final review, Menéndez said.\n\nPilar Guzmán Ríos died more than a week after the storm.\n\nIn Corozal, an interior municipality northwest of Vidal\'s house fire, Pilar Guzmán Ríos\' doctor declared her death natural -- and therefore not subject to forensic review -- without seeing her body. He did so, he told us in an interview, because it was nearly impossible to reach her house by road at the time. And he wanted her grieving family to be able to move on.\n\nIf her body had been sent to the forensics office, Dr. Francisco Berio said, then it could have been subjected to review for days or weeks. If her death was natural, the family could bury her now. He signed her death certificate on September 29. Cause of death: cardiac arrest.\n\nThe truth is sadder and more complex.\n\nGuzmán was a veritable force in her mountaintop community. Her booming voice echoed through the hills. She\'d scream "¡Hola, chica!" at complete strangers and run to greet them. Her kisses smacked so hard, according to relatives, they left ears ringing. She kept three parrots on her back patio -- Paulina, Cuqui and Blanqui -- and she taught them to sing "La Cucaracha" and chant the rosary, making them just as boisterous and devout as she was. She learned to drive late in life, but once she had a driver\'s license, neighbors started calling her the "town taxi" and the "town ambulance" because she gave so many free lifts.\n\nPaula Guzmán still lives in a shelter in an elementary school.\n\nThe morning of her death, Guzmán\'s sister-in-law, Madeline Berríos, walked into Pilar\'s home to find her three parrots "completely silent" for the first time she can recall. She knew then what she would find next: Pilar\'s lifeless body resting on a bed beneath an image of Jesus.\n\nHer family saw it coming because of the conditions of the storm. The vibrant, joyful woman suffered from a number of health issues, and she needed an electric-powered machine to help her breathe through the night as well as refrigeration to safely store the insulin she took to manage diabetes. Without either, said Yaitza Nieves, a nurse who also is Pilar\'s grandniece, and other family members, her lips started turning blue. She became weak and dizzy, unable to hold silverware. She couldn\'t feed or bathe herself. She started mumbling incoherently.\n\n"Even the cats prayed for Pilar," a cousin said.\n\nFamily members said they called 911 repeatedly and were told an ambulance would arrive to get the woman who normally would have driven a person in this situation to the hospital.\n\n"The death of my sister is related to the Hurricane María because we had no power or running water," said Paula Guzmán Ríos, Pilar\'s sister, who is still living in a shelter without water or power because her roof was torn off and she lives on a hillside vulnerable to landslides. "And, besides that, calls for an ambulance were made -- and the ambulance never arrived."\n\n\'We\'ve run out of tears\'\n\nHer family didn\'t know it, but if Pilar Guzmán\'s death had been counted as part of the official Hurricane Maria tally, they might have been eligible for federal aid. A program run by the US Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, helps families pay for funeral expenses if they can prove their relative died in the storm. The maximum is $6,000; but the deaths must be certified as hurricane-related in order to qualify, according to a FEMA spokesman.\n\nThis is just one way the accuracy of the death toll has tangible consequences.\n\nPilar Guzmán Ríos lived in Corozal, where the government says no one died because of the storm.\n\nIf the world has the impression that the death toll in Puerto Rico is low -- as Trump highlighted in his October 3 press conference -- then donations and public assistance are less likely to flow toward Puerto Rico, said Klinenberg, the sociologist at New York University.\n\n"One reason it matters is because there\'s a question of how bad the situation is -- and how many resources are required to help," he said by phone. "Is it still an emergency, or is the emergency over?" When the public hears that relatively few people died then they get the message: \'Everyone relax and the local government can handle this.\'\n\n"If people are dying every week, that sends a very different message," he said.\n\nThe US government\'s response to the hurricane in Puerto Rico has been widely panned as slow and inadequate. One month after the storm, about 1 million of the island\'s residents were without running water, and some 3 million didn\'t have electricity , according to Puerto Rican government estimates.\n\nThe island had a weak power grid and bad roads before the hurricane hit, and conditions are improving. Nearly two months after the hurricane\'s landfall, however, progress remains spotty.\n\nSeveral relatives of Pilar Guzmán, for example, are still living in an elementary school. They collect rainwater from the roof and power a small battery with a car engine. It runs a single light and charges a few cellular phones, which can\'t get a signal most of the time.\n\nJosé A. Ortiz Guzmán says his mom "would still be with us" if not for the hurricane. "She would still be enjoying life."\n\nThe mayor of their town, Sergio L. Torres Torres, says deaths will continue if conditions don\'t improve. He disputes the Puerto Rican government\'s claim no one died here.\n\n"I know for a fact there are deaths that resulted from the storm," he said.\n\nExperts tell us knowing how, where and why people died could help protect the public in future disasters.\n\nMeanwhile, families of the dead say their loved ones are being forgotten.\n\nWhen we met relatives of Quintín Vidal, for example, the man who died in the house fire, his granddaughter, Lisandra Llera Vidal, thanked us for coming to talk about a death she thinks the US and Puerto Rican governments want ignored. "You are going to be our eyes and ears to the world," she said.\n\n"We\'ve run out of tears."\n\nThe Puerto Rican forensics bureau says his case is pending toxicological review to help determine whether his death was caused by the hurricane.\n\n\'Potentially problematic\'\n\nAnecdotally, two threads ran through the uncounted deaths reported to us by funeral homes: People seem to have died primarily in the aftermath of the hurricane, rather than the storm itself; and many of the victims seem to be older people.\n\nWe were unable to document any so-called "direct" hurricane deaths -- such as those suffered from blunt trauma or injury -- that occurred the day of the storm and were missed by the government. People who may have suffered deaths indirectly related to the storm -- those who died awaiting medical treatment, who committed suicide in the aftermath of Maria, or who perished due to lack of power and clean water -- were easier to identify.\n\nSome of the undercounting appears to result from confusion about what should classify as a hurricane death. The Puerto Rican government says indirect deaths do count. On its official list, there are three suicides and a few heart attacks, for example. One official hurricane death occurred after a person fell off the roof while apparently trying to repair a storm-damaged home.\n\nNot everyone knows which types of deaths should be counted, however.\n\nIn Arecibo, a coastal municipality west of San Juan, CNN previously reported on the death of Isabel Rivera González, 80 . Her family believes she died awaiting a medical procedure in a hospital that didn\'t have power because of the storm. The Manatí Medical Center, where she was treated, confirmed the power outage but said it did not contribute to her death. Rivera had been a patient of the hospital before and had a pre-existing heart condition, they said.\n\nIsabel Rivera González died at the Manati Medical Center.\n\nJosé S. Rosado, executive director of the medical center, said in October that no deaths from that hospital had been sent to San Juan for forensic analysis. Only blunt trauma, drownings, falls, crime scene victims and bodies that are found dead on arrival, among others, should be sent to the capital for analysis, he said. That appears to conflict with the Puerto Rican government\'s definition, which includes indirect hurricane deaths such as heart attacks.\n\n"They were all natural causes of death," Rosado said.\n\nThe Puerto Rican government distributed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to hospitals on when deaths should be sent to the forensics lab. The Manatí Medical Center maintains it has followed those guidelines in deciding which deaths to send.\n\nThere are few legal requirements, however, on which deaths must be sent for analysis.\n\nTypes of deaths that must go to San Juan for review include crime victims, poisonings, suicides, accidental deaths, cremations, nursing home deaths and children\'s deaths, among others, according to a 2017 law that established new guidelines for forensics.\n\nSome states have medical examiners or coroners stationed locally to ensure deaths are counted and identified consistently, said Dr. Gregory J. Davis, a professor and director of the University of Kentucky\'s Forensic Pathology Consultation Service. In Puerto Rico, only one office classifies these deaths, frequently leaving doctors and hospitals to decide which bodies are analyzed. That is "potentially problematic," Davis said, because some hospitals might have an incentive not to report deaths that occurred during power outages or other dangerous situations.\n\n"On the other hand," he said by email, "not reporting could open them up to legal liability."\n\n\'The disaster is about our failure to act\'\n\nPolitics also could sway the process.\n\nPuerto Rico\'s Institute of Forensic Sciences was formed in 1985 in response to concerns of political corruption in the investigation process, according to the text of the 1985 law.\n\nThe institute was initially intended to be an independent research body, beyond the sway of politics. But a 2017 law changed the name of the office to the Bureau of Forensic Sciences and put it under the control of the newly created Public Safety Department.\n\nThe secretary of public safety is named by Puerto Rico\'s elected governor.\n\nPesquera, the secretary of public safety, told CNN in October that any insinuation of political meddling in the death toll is "horseshit." "You think I care what the government of the United States thinks about the body count? I don\'t care," he said. "I could care less what\'s less embarrassing." He\'d rather see more deaths included than excluded, he said.\n\n"There is no reason whatsoever for us not to include an accurate count."\n\nPower service has been slow to return to many parts of Puerto Rico.\n\nAs unsafe conditions continue weeks after the storm, however, said Klinenberg, the NYU professor, more of the blame will fall on the government and its response.\n\n"That\'s not natural" to have people dying without electricity weeks after the hurricane, he said. "That\'s not about the weather. That\'s a story of political negligence. Of course, it\'s related to Maria if you can\'t get to the hospital because the roads are closed down or you have a waterborne illness because the water is dirty. There are all kinds of mental illness problems that come up because of things like this. These are all directly or indirectly related to the disaster.\n\n"At this point, the disaster is about our failure to act as much as anything else."\n\n\'The water is coming!\'\n\nThe forensics office maintains many bodies were never sent to them for review.\n\nCNN, however, looked into two particular cases of possible hurricane deaths that were sent to the forensics office but have not, as yet, been included on the official death toll of 55.\n\nCarlos Robles told CNN his father killed himself because of the shock of Hurricane Maria.\n\nOne was Quintín Vidal, the fire victim who died October 20.\n\nThe forensics office told CNN its pathologists are still conducting a toxicological review and have not decided whether to declare the death as hurricane-related.\n\nThe other was Juan B. Robles Díaz, who hanged himself on September 27.\n\nThe forensics office maintains the suicide was unrelated to the hurricane. Robles had been diagnosed with skin cancer months before. Carlos Robles, his son, however, told us his 70-year-old father had been in relatively good spirits following a round of cancer treatment in the United States.\n\nThat changed after the hurricane, he said.\n\nFor several nights after Hurricane Maria wrecked his Canóvanas home here in the valley below the mountain rainforest in eastern Puerto Rico, a place where horses roam the streets and some homes still don\'t have roofs, the elder Robles woke up in the night frantic and screaming.\n\n"The water is coming! It\'s flooding!" he yelled, according to his son.\n\nOn September 20, the storm brought about 8 feet of water into the family\'s pink concrete house, which Juan Robles had lived in for decades, according to Carlos Robles. Water rushed through doors and windows and spewed out of the toilet. Panicked, the family smashed a window in a bedroom in the back of the house to escape. Thirteen of them waded through a rush of stomach-deep water and cut through a fence to seek higher ground.\n\n"I thought we were going to drown," said Carlos Robles, 47.\n\nCarlos Robles said the family had to break a window and wade through 8 feet of rushing water to escape their home.\n\nJuan Robles survived that day, but the man who used to sit on his porch teasing the runners who passed by, and who never shied away from a fight, never was the same.\n\nAfter Hurricane Maria, he awoke with night terrors, fearing another hurricane loomed, Carlos Robles said. He ran down the street yelling at the top of his lungs. The house was all but unlivable, but Juan Robles insisted on staying there to protect it. During the day, he positioned a couch by the window so that he could watch for the moment the water would return, his son said.\n\nSeven days after the storm, Juan Robles hanged himself in the bedroom closet.\n\nHis 18-year-old grandson found him there, Carlos Robles said.\n\nWorkers at the funeral home that identified Juan Robles\'s death to us as potentially hurricane-related find it astounding that Puerto Rico would not include his death in its tally.\n\n"How is it possible that this man is not on that list?" said Miriam Vélez de Nieves, who works at the Frankie Memorial Funeral Home in Río Grande. "I don\'t know how to explain it."\n\nCarlos Robles believes his father\'s death was a consequence of Hurricane Maria, too.\n\nThe Robles home is all but unlivable. Carlos Robles is staying with relatives.\n\nHe told CNN that investigators from the forensics office interviewed him after he identified the body. That interview lasted 30 minutes, he said, and included no questions about the hurricane. Some of the context came up, he said, but no one asked about it directly.\n\nA forensic investigator told us interviews typically last closer to 1 hour and 45 minutes.\n\nHalf-hour interviews are "highly unusual," the investigator said.\n\nThe forensics office said there is no mandated time frame for a forensic interview. The office did not respond to repeat requests for autopsy reports and related documentation.\n\nPesquera did say his office is open to adding to the official death count, however.\n\nIn response to CNN\'s questions about 71-year-old José Rafael Sánchez Román, whose family says he died of a heart attack or stroke during the storm\'s impact, Pesquera told us his office was unaware of the case but would investigate further. If the medical crisis was caused by the shock of the storm, and help wasn\'t available, such a death could be counted, he said.\n\nPesquera told CNN there\'s no deadline for a death to be reviewed as part of the Hurricane Maria death toll. Forensics examinations could be reopened even after a person had been buried, he said.\n\nThe Puerto Rican government helped set up a phone line to collect tips from funeral homes about hurricane-related deaths and went into the field to investigate reports, said Menéndez, the deputy director of the Bureau of Forensic Sciences. "We went to cemeteries, we went to funeral homes, and it was not as they said," she told CNN. "We did do that part and we did work together. The thing is, once again, it\'s rumors. So, how far do we keep on going? ... That\'s not my responsibility to go out and verify (reports of hurricane-related deaths), but we took it upon ourselves to verify these rumors."\n\nIn the future, Pesquera said, death certificates in Puerto Rico should be updated so that there is a clear place for doctors to mark whether or not a death may have been related to a storm or other natural disaster.\n\n\'More people are going to die\'\n\nA Bible is one of few artifacts left in Juan Robles\' home.\n\nOur last stop in Puerto Rico was to meet with Quintín Vidal\'s family in Cayey.\n\nThere, on November 15, a dozen family members sat in folding chairs in his granddaughter\'s living room, which is one of the few homes in the area with power service.\n\nTwo public officials in the municipality say Vidal\'s death is a sign of federal and Puerto Rican government incompetence. If power service had been restored more quickly, they said, he wouldn\'t have died in the October 20 fire. It\'s far too easy to dismiss the deaths of older people, assuming they would die soon anyway, said Jesús Martínez, Cayey\'s director of emergency management. Doing so ignores the urgency of the humanitarian crisis.\n\n"More people are going to die if we continue to be off the grid," he said.\n\nThe Puerto Rican and federal governments are creating the false impression that the emergency is over, said Cayey Mayor Rolando Ortiz. "They just want to have a good story," he said, "to make things look positive for them." The reality, he said, is deaths continue -- and they\'re largely unacknowledged or they\'re slow to be reported by Puerto Rico.\n\nNeighbors of Quintín Vidal Rolón read Bible verses in his memory on November 15.\n\nOn a table in the family\'s home were several framed photographs of Vidal. In one, taken in May this year, he\'s shown in his characteristic white hat, blue shirt and khakis -- always dapper -- helping to pave the sidewalk in front of the home where the family had gathered to remember him. The cowboy hat was on the table, too. As well as an image of that 1962 truck.\n\nThe neighbor who called firefighters to the scene of the house fire that killed Vidal led the group in the recitation of the rosary, a Catholic tradition meant, in this case, to help a person pass from their earthly life into the peace and tranquility of heaven. The Hail Mary prayer is repeated 50 times, along with two other prayers repeated five times each.\n\n"Santa María, Madre de Dios..."\n\nBefore the prayers, the family had spoken to us about Vidal\'s death. They were horrified such a gentle and hardworking man died in such a violent and painful way.\n\nAnd they fear that power outages continue to put their neighbors at risk.\n\n"... ruega por nosotros pecadores.\n\nAhora y en la hora de nuestra muerte."\n\nPray for us sinners.\n\nNow and at the hour of our death.\n\nSuddenly, during the recitations, darkness fell over the room.\n\nThe power had gone out, revealing three tiny candles on the table next to Vidal\'s signature hat.\n\nFlames filled the room with speckled light.', 'title': "Puerto Rico's uncounted Hurricane Maria deaths", 'url': 'https://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/20/health/hurricane-maria-uncounted-deaths-invs/index.html', 'keywords': ['rico', 'deaths', 'uncounted', 'died', 'robles', 'storm', 'maria', 'family', 'hurricane', 'death', 'ricos', 'puerto', 'funeral'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': "JUST WATCHED Puerto Rico's uncounted Hurricane Maria deaths Replay More Videos ...

The Category 4 storm was so massive – 300 miles wide – that it enveloped the island entirely, battering it with 155 mph winds and dropping almost two feet of rain.\n\nThe next day, Puerto Ricans awoke to a radically altered reality. Two months after the storm, the island still faces shortages of food, water, electricity, transportation, cell service and medical services – an American humanitarian crisis that even today shows few signs of improvement.\n\nHere, experts answer five key questions about Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.\n\n1. What has life been like since the storm?\n\nFor Puerto Ricans who stayed on the island, life has been extraordinarily hard. Just finding enough food and water to survive can be a daily struggle, especially for people in rural areas and places cut off from help by washed-out bridges or mudslides.\n\nEvelyn Milagros Rodriguez, a librarian at the University of Puerto Rico’s Humacao campus, offers an insider’s view of what life is like on the island’s eastern shore (in Spanish here).\n\nShe hasn’t been able to go to work since the storm, she says, because the library is “mold-infested and the roof is leaking. The mold has gotten into our collection…most of the furniture and computers will have to be replaced.”\n\nAfter three weeks of a near-total communication blackout, radio, television, telephones and internet are starting to recover. Still, Rodriguez says, electricity comes and goes, and “it took me more than two weeks just to write this article, between finding somewhere to charge my laptop and locating an internet connection strong enough to research the data and send a file by email.”\n\nHurricane Maria demolished an estimated 100,000 homes and buildings, and 90 percent of the island’s infrastructure is damaged or destroyed.\n\nIt’s also unsafe to venture outside at night. An island-wide curfew was lifted in October, but without streetlights, stoplights or police, driving and walking are dangerous after dark.\n\n“Nothing is easy,” Rodriguez reports.\n\n2. Why are things still so bad?\n\nAfter a decade of fiscal decline and a May 2017 bankruptcy, Puerto Rico was exceptionally vulnerable by the time Maria hit. Before the hurricane, people already struggled with food insecurity, poor health care and crumbling public infrastructure, the result of both damaging U.S. policy and deepening financial crisis.\n\nNow these problems are complicating Puerto Rico’s recovery, asserts Lauren Lluveras, a policy analyst at the University of Texas, Austin.\n\nLluveras, whose family is Puerto Rican, notes that in addition to preexisting financial hardship, a lackluster federal relief effort has made storm recovery much harder. The Trump administration delayed dispatching military personnel and material relief until after the hurricane made landfall and allowed a waiver to the Jones Act – a law dictating that only U.S.-made or U.S.-staffed vessels can do commerce in American waters – to lapse.\n\nThat “reduce[s] the number of ships that can bring aid to the island,” she says. Both of these federal actions “have slowed Puerto Rico’s recovery considerably.”\n\nOn Nov. 13, Puerto Rico’s governor asked the federal government for US$94.4 billion in aid. Previously, Congress had approved just $5 billion in disaster funding for Puerto Rico.\n\n3. Why is the power still out?\n\nTwo months after Hurricane Maria, something like 75 percent of Puerto Ricans still don’t have electricity. At times, hundreds of thousands of households – particularly in San Juan and other urban areas – have seen power restored, only to be plunged into darkness again by a system failure.\n\nThat’s because almost half of Puerto Rico’s power generation comes from “old, very expensive oil-fired plants,” writes Peter Fox-Penner, director of Boston University’s Institute for Sustainable Energy.\n\nBefore it went bankrupt in 2017, PREPA, the island’s sole energy provider, had been hoping to upgrade these aged facilities and incorporate renewable energy sources like solar and gas. Then Maria knocked out the entire grid, and all of PREPA’s resources have gone toward just getting Puerto Rico’s lights turned back on.\n\nThe island’s extended outage is “a humanitarian crisis that has yet to be resolved,” Fox-Penner writes. He believes that any hope of Puerto Rico emerging from this storm with a greener, more durable grid – one better able to withstand future hurricanes – have been dashed.\n\nOn Nov. 17, PREPA’s director resigned.\n\n4. How does living without power for so long affect people?\n\nShao Lin, Professor of Public Health at SUNY-Albany, has researched how prolonged blackouts impact health. She believes that Puerto Ricans can expect to see numerous lasting effects from this power outage, including mental health issues.\n\nAfter Hurricane Sandy, the power was out for about 12 to 14 days in some parts of New York City. For months afterwards, Lin found, residents reported more emergency department visits due to anxiety and mood disorder. They were also more prone to excess drinking and problematic drug use.\n\nThe power outage in Puerto Rico has already lasted eight weeks, much longer than the blackout in New York City.\n\nAs a result, “We should expect to see a corresponding increase in disease – not only mental health issues, but also diseases that depend on electricity for treatment, such as renal failure, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,” warns Lin.\n\n5. Will this crisis change how the US treats Puerto Rico?\n\nPedro Caban, a professor at SUNY-Albany, thinks that the appalling aftermath of Hurricane Maria could improve Puerto Rico’s political status, moving the needle on longstanding harmful American policies.\n\nPuerto Rico is an unincorporated territorial possession of the United States, meaning that the Puerto Rican government exercises only those powers that the Congress allows. “In other words,” says Caban, “it is still a colony.”\n\nThe humanitarian crisis there has prompted the Puerto Rican diaspora in the U.S. to fight for their island. They are actively lobbying against some of the most restrictive colonial policies, among them the Jones Act and the oversight board that has controlled Puerto Rico’s budget since it declared bankruptcy earlier this year.\n\nThis could be a “watershed moment that redefines U.S. treatment of Puerto Rico,” writes Caban.\n\nBeyond pressuring local officials and the federal government, Puerto Ricans across the U.S. have organized a nationwide campaign to raise funding and collect donations for Puerto Rico. An outraged and emboldened diaspora, it turns out, may finally get the federal government to resolve Puerto Rico’s damaging colonial status.', 'title': 'Puerto Rico two months after Maria: 5 essential reads', 'url': 'https://theconversation.com/puerto-rico-two-months-after-maria-5-essential-reads-87409', 'keywords': ['rico', 'ricans', 'island', 'health', 'hurricane', 'power', 'months', 'storm', 'maria', 'reads', 'puerto', 'essential', 'ricos'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'On Sept. 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria tore across Puerto Rico.\nHere, experts answer five key questions about Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.\nBoth of these federal actions “have slowed Puerto Rico’s recovery considerably.”On Nov. 13, Puerto Rico’s governor asked the federal government for US$94.4 billion in aid.\nPuerto Rico is an unincorporated territorial possession of the United States, meaning that the Puerto Rican government exercises only those powers that the Congress allows.\nBeyond pressuring local officials and the federal government, Puerto Ricans across the U.S. have organized a nationwide campaign to raise funding and collect donations for Puerto Rico.', 'date': 1511144623}, {'text': 'San Juan, Puerto Rico\n\nElectrical blackouts wiped every single item from the menu at Double Cake, a trendy bakery in San Juan. But instead of closing, Double Cake’s owners came up with ”pacos,” a cross between a pancake and a taco that they could make without electricity.\n\nThe Paco is a product of the disaster wrought by Hurricane Maria. The folded pancake is cooked over a gas grill instead of baked in Double Cake’s storm-disabled electric ovens. It can also be eaten with your hands, eliminating need for forks and washing. Yet the simple paco is as sweet a treat as a decorated cupcake, and is adaptable to whatever filling is at hand: peanut butter, cream cheese, even breakfast cereal.\n\nDouble Cake is a tiny business, but the lengths to which its owners have gone to keep it running are indicative of the entrepreneurial drive Hurricane Maria has unleashed in Puerto Rico. From a San Juan lawyer-turned-diesel dealer to the mountain resident who rigged a DIY mobile laundromat, ”people are having to adapt to the new reality,” says Orlando Santiago, one of Double Cake’s owners.\n\nTheir ingenuity post-Maria could be the beginning of a long-overdue economic revitalization for the US territory. Decades-old structural problems have kept the broke island from holding its own economically. But the hurricane’s devastation offers Puerto Rico a rare chance to reinvent its economy using a gush of fresh cash in federal disaster aid.\n\nThere’s also the risk, however, that the billions of dollars expected to flow from Washington D.C. will only deepen its dependency on the mainland. Like many other things in the island, which direction Puerto Rico takes will largely depend on the faraway lawmakers who hold the purse strings.\n\nQuartz/Ana Campoy Yarizta Lozano, on of Double Cake’s owners, stands next to her post-Maria means of production. She got the griddle in the first days after Maria, when K-Mart was taking orders at the door and deploying a headlamp-clad employee into darkened aisles to fill requests.\n\nA colonial economy, today\n\nPuerto Rico’s precarious economic state before the hurricane was decades, if not centuries, in the making. Once a colony of Spain, the island became a US territory in 1898, and was officially taken out of the United Nations list of non-self governing territories, or colonies, in 1953. Still, in many ways it remains just that, experts argue—a colony.\n\nThroughout the island’s history, external investors have operated as self-contained units within the island, with few contributions to the local economy other than the jobs they create. Back in the first few decades of 1900s, when sugar was Puerto Rico’s top industry, outside plantation owners exported their production, as well as their earnings.\n\nDecades-old structural problems have kept the island from holding its own.\n\nIn 1947, local officials launched an ambitious industrialization crusade in hopes of making the island more self-sufficient: Operation Bootstrap. Officials attracted outside capital through generous tax breaks, both at the local and federal levels. The idea was that mainland manufacturers would move operations to Puerto Rico, generating business for local suppliers and passing on their know-how, spawning more local companies, says Deepak Lamba-Nieves, an economic development expert at the Center for a New Economy, a San Juan-based think tank.\n\nWhat happened was the opposite. Instead of buying raw materials in Puerto Rico, many companies imported what they needed. Just like the sugar plantation owners before them, they sent both the finished product and profits back home.\n\nThe island’s fatal co-dependency\n\nWhich leads us to another crippling consequence of the Puerto Rican model: its import dependency. Because a big chunk of the island’s farmable land was historically devoted to growing sugar for export, food for locals had to be imported. Today, it still is.\n\nOperation Bootstrap’s industrialization drive further dented the agriculture sector by luring Puerto Rican workers from the countryside into cities. It also increased Puerto Rico’s reliance on other kinds of imported products, since so much of what was manufactured locally was destined to leave the island.\n\nIn one case, merchandise produced by in Puerto Rico was even shipped to the mainland before making the return trip to be sold locally—at a steep mark-up, said San Juan mayor Carmén Yulin Cruz in a 2014 interview.\n\nThis mismatch between supply and demand, both dependent on the outside, resulted in a wobbly local economy which is unable to sustain itself. It has trouble creating jobs even in the best of times, says José Caraballo Cueto, a University of Puerto Rico professor who has studied the origin of the island’s financial troubles.\n\nPuerto Rico’s escape valves: Welfare and emigration\n\nElsewhere, this might have toppled the government, or bred the kind of destitute misery that you find in other places in Latin America. But because Puerto Rico is part of the US, its unemployed citizens can easily move to the mainland to get a job, as hundreds of thousands have done in past decades.\n\nThose who stay can survive on food stamps. Nearly 40% of the island’s 3.4 million residents currently get that help, according to the US Department of Agriculture.\n\nThese two escape valves kept the Puerto Rican economy churning—until the federal government pulled out the piece that held it all together. In 2006, it ended the tax incentives that had lured mainland manufacturers to the island. Many left, laying off tens of thousands of employees and setting off a debilitating chain of events that sunk the island in a decade-long recession. The loss of jobs spurred the largest exodus of Puerto Ricans to the mainland yet. That, in turn, hurt the businesses that catered to them and reduced tax collections. The government had to borrow just to keep running, until it couldn’t pay back what it owed.\n\nThat led to Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy filing in May. Four months later, Maria clobbered what was left of the Puerto Rican economy.\n\nThe vicious cycle\n\nThe familiar vicious cycle— lost jobs leading to emigration leading to an even weaker economy —is already materializing. Without power, many businesses, including 5,000 small ones (link in Spanish,) remain closed. The number of jobs dipped by 29,000 (Spanish) to 940,000 in October compared with August—there is no solid data for September, due to the hurricane. Another 175,000 employees who haven’t been laid off did not work last month due to hurricane-related complications, according to the Labor and Human Resources Department.\n\nMore than 100,000 people have left the island, taking with them purchasing power and taxable income.\n\nAn opening for local companies\n\nYet Puerto Rico is still sputtering along—and may now have a better shot at gaining economic independence than ever before.\n\n“Companies that produce locally can respond more quickly.”\n\nThe storm has reconfigured the island’s economy around products and services whose demand has suddenly shot up: generators, diesel, purified water, hot food, cold beer. Because of the logistical debacle caused by Maria, it’s been cumbersome to ship in these and other items from the mainland. This is finally giving local firms an advantage—and offering a glimpse of how they could play a bigger role in the island’s economy.\n\n“Companies that produce locally can respond more quickly. Their products can be in the hands of the clients tomorrow vs. the companies that import,” says Jorge Bracero, chief marketing officer of Cervecera de Puerto Rico. The brewer is making the most of the opportunity, donating generators to its clients and sponsoring happy hours so it can sell more beer under a program it’s calling “Restart.”\n\nRaquel Pérez Puig for Quartz Post-Maria blackouts have idled Puerto Ricans electric stoves and refrigerators, so many are going out to eat and drink.\n\nIn the mountain municipality of Utuado, Speedy González Tire Center is an example of how the federal government could boost the island’s debilitated small-business sector by simply buying local. The National Guard, which sits next to the small shop, is using it to service all of its vehicles. Daniel González, its owner, says he’s been making more money after Maria than before.\n\nRaquel Pérez Puig for Quartz Daniel González says his tire repair shop is getting more business after Maria.\n\nFederal and state officials could work with locals firms so that the one-time disaster aid funds empower them permanently. But signals from San Juan and Washington D.C. are so far not encouraging.\n\nThe local government is taking its usual centralized and bureaucratic route. Last month, governor Ricardo Roselló created a new state agency (Spanish) charged with coming up with a reconstruction plan and managing all the federal, state, and private funds available to carry it out. On top of that, his administration’s management of the power outage, marred by a controversial contract with the tiny, inexperienced firm Whitefish, is undermining its own argument for autonomy.\n\nThe Financial Oversight and Management Board, a US president-appointed body that is supervising Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy process, has asked Congress members to make federal aid contingent on the Puerto Rican government adopting board-proposed measures. It’s a worrying prospect for the recovery process, given that the board’s mission has been to slash government spending, not to build up an economy.\n\nGrassroots reconstruction\n\nOn the ground, though, there are efforts to fight back the top-down approach. The Center for a New Economy has put together a citizen-led advisory commission (Spanish) to come up with reconstruction strategies to catapult Puerto Rico past its sorry pre-Maria state. The group, which is backed by the Rockefeller, Ford, and Open Society Foundations, is promising a plan by early spring.\n\n“There are American citizens here that need help. The destruction has been massive,” said Lamba-Nieves, the researcher at the think tank. “At the same time, the fact that the federal government is sending us funds shouldn’t mean that they are going to impose a single vision of how they should be used.”\n\nOther local non-profits are moving ahead with programs to buoy Puerto Rico’s small firms, which employ more than 80% of the Puerto Ricans in the private sector, according to the the US Small Business Administration. Their improved fortunes would arguably reverberate throughout the rest of the economy.\n\nYou can see the proof of concept back at Double Cake. Its owners are making the most of a $1,600 donation and financial advice from Inprende, a group that promotes entrepreneurs. A few weeks later, they were able to start baking thanks to a subsidized generator lease they got through another local booster, Foundation for Puerto Rico.\n\nThey’ve kept on nearly a dozen employees. As they ramp up, they’ll start placing egg and milk orders from their local suppliers, which in turn will do the same, in theory.\n\nDouble Cake finally got grid power a few days ago. The blackout’s crushing conditions are fading, but Double Cake is still deploying the business savvy it acquired during that time, says Santiago. ”It prepared us to operate under any kind of circumstances,” he adds.\n\nPacos, which proved popular, are also staying.', 'title': 'Hurricane Maria is Puerto Rico’s chance to finally stand on its own two feet', 'url': 'https://qz.com/1135384/hurricane-maria-is-puerto-ricos-chance-to-finally-stand-on-its-own-two-feet/', 'keywords': ['rico', 'chance', 'double', 'islands', 'economy', 'local', 'maria', 'stand', 'federal', 'finally', 'hurricane', 'island', 'feet', 'mainland', 'ricos', 'puerto'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'But the hurricane’s devastation offers Puerto Rico a rare chance to reinvent its economy using a gush of fresh cash in federal disaster aid.\nLike many other things in the island, which direction Puerto Rico takes will largely depend on the faraway lawmakers who hold the purse strings.\nBack in the first few decades of 1900s, when sugar was Puerto Rico’s top industry, outside plantation owners exported their production, as well as their earnings.\nInstead of buying raw materials in Puerto Rico, many companies imported what they needed.\nThat led to Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy filing in May.', 'date': None}, {'text': '\'A lot of panic attacks\': Mental health top concern in Maria-ravaged Puerto Rico\n\nJAYUYA, Puerto Rico — People who visit a local community center here for bottled water or hot coffee often break down crying or shaking uncontrollably.\n\nMargie Vazquez, a community organizer who lost her home to Hurricane Maria seven weeks ago, often cries at home before heading to the center to help others. When members of the Federal Emergency Management Agency first showed up a few weeks ago with pallets of water, many people started crying, she said.\n\n“A lot of panic attacks, a lot of crying,” Vazquez said. “There’s a lot of suffering right now.”\n\nPeople in this storm-ravaged mountain town still need water, electricity, hot meals and new roofs.

The storm killed at least 55 people, destroyed thousands of homes and left remote mountain towns like Jayuya even more cut off from the rest of the world. More than half of the island still doesn\'t have power and around 10% don\'t have clean running water.\n\nStress often sets in as storm survivors transition from securing basic needs, like food and water, to longer-term thoughts of where to live and how to rebuild their homes, said Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health\n\n"People are extremely vulnerable right now" in Puerto Rico, he said. "Virtually everyone needs some assistance to get through this."\n\nTo help people in harder-to-reach communities, such as Jayuya, officials at Ponce Health Sciences University in nearby Ponce began deploying teams of doctors, psychologists and public health specialists into the mountains days after the storm. The private medical university has taken a leading role in recovery in the area and the teams have seen more than 6,000 patients since the storm.\n\nOn a recent trip, a convoy of doctors, administrators and university students drove more than an hour through winding mountain roads still being cleared of storm debris and mudslides to reach the community center in the Mameyes neighborhood of Jayuya. The area has been without power or water since Maria.\n\nInside the center, stacks of bottled water and untouched military Meals Ready to Eat sat at one end of the darkened building. At the other, a team of public health students urged locals to wear long pants and close-toed shoes if wading into a river to wash clothes, or add a few drops of unscented Clorox to water before drinking.\n\nAt an intake table, university workers checked locals\' blood pressure and noted medical histories, then added a few extra questions: Are you sad? Trouble sleeping? Hand tremors? Anxiety?

People need to have the mental health in order to regain some semblance of normalcy," she said. "If you don’t get a grip on acute stress, that could spiral into other things that could become potentially incapacitating.

A strong mudslide could wipe the home off its mountaintop perch and send it crashing to the valley below. They desperately need help fixing the more permanent homes battered by Maria.

Although all travel came screeching to a halt in the immediate wake of the storm, the island\'s population has since been steadily trickling away, with more people leaving Puerto Rico than arriving (or returning).\n\nWhat\'s more, people in Puerto Rico have been about half as mobile as usual since the storm, and have been moving around 30 percent of their normal distances. The team suggests that this activity is consistent with school and business closures as well as the reports of infrastructural damage to roadways, etc.\n\nTheir findings represent some of the first quantitative analyses of the hurricane\'s impact on human behavior.

That’s why they only form over warm ocean waters near the equator.\n\nThe warm, moist air above these waters rises upward from near the surface, causing an area of lower air pressure below. Air from surrounding areas with higher air pressure then swirls into the low pressure area, where it becomes warm and moist, before rising too.\n\n“As the warmed, moist air rises and cools off, the water in the air forms clouds. The whole system of clouds and wind spins and grows, fed by the ocean’s heat and water evaporating from the surface.”\n\nStatistics from the US Environmental Protection Agency show that, between 1901 and 2015, ocean surface temperatures rose at an average rate of 0.07°C per decade - meaning more warm water is available to fuel the intensity of hurricanes worldwide. Harvey broke the record for the highest level of rainfall recorded from a single hurricane in the US mainland, further highlighting the increasing levels of evaporation.\n\nThus the rainfall levels and wind speeds during tropical storms are increasing, says CNN’s Wayne Drash, and a seven-inch rise in sea levels over the past century adds to the resulting flooding threat.\n\nWhat's in a name?\n\n“Tropical storms are given names when they display a rotating circulation pattern and wind speeds of 39mph,” says Earth Sky. “A tropical storm develops into a hurricane when wind speeds reach 74mph.”\n\nAccording to a report on BBC Newsnight, between 1981 and 2010 the average Atlantic hurricane season produced six named storms, 2.6 of which then became hurricanes. By contrast, 13 named storms have already been recorded this year, seven of which have been classified as hurricanes.\n\nHowever, experts at Germany’s Max Planck institute say that the number of overall depressions and storms, named or unnamed, has remained fairly constant, and that “the model calculations do not exhibit any significant trend in the frequency of intense tropical storms” - indicating it is the intensity of storms that is rising, and not the overall number.\n\nThere are also issues with exactly how named storms have been measured over past years.\n\nIn a 2010 research paper titled Impact of duration thresholds on Atlantic tropical cyclone counts, Christopher W. Landsea, of the National Hurricane Centre in Florida, concludes that “the rising trend in severe Atlantic tropical storm counts is almost entirely due to increases in short-duration (less than two days) storms alone” and that “such short-lived storms were particularly likely to have been overlooked in the earlier parts of the record, as they would have had less opportunity for chance encounters with ship traffic”.\n\nIs there a counterargument?\n\nScientists are generally cautious about commenting on the impact climate change may have on hurricanes.\n\n“The data on how our warming planet specifically impacted Harvey and Irma won’t be known for quite some time,” says CNN’s Drash. “It can take months and even years to collect and analyse that information.”\n\nSome scientists argue that other factors unconnected to climate change may be behind changes in the severity of storms, with some going so far as to suggest that climate change may, in fact, decrease the power of hurricanes.\n\nProfessor Joanna Haigh, from the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment, in London, told BBC Newsnight that global warming could be viewed in a different light.\n\n“There is a competing effect, which is that if we also see higher temperatures higher up in the atmosphere, that could actually weaken a hurricane.”\n\nHowever, she added, no theory has yet been proven.\n\nFrom observations alone, “we will never be able to say, ‘This event could only have happened due to climate change’”, she said, but “we can say that the likelihood of certain events occurring has changed due to climate change, and that would be extreme rainfall”.\n\nPredicting the future\n\nMost scientists are wary of jumping to conclusions about climate change and hurricane trends, but there does appear to be consensus about the future outlook.\n\nThe Atlantic reports that researchers using climate models “have high confidence that future storms will drop more rain, and medium confidence that they will have higher wind speeds”. CNN reporter Drash adds that “most scientists say there won’t necessarily be more hurricanes - just the potential for more hurricane-related flooding and destruction”.\n\nExperts at the US Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory issue a further warning. They estimate that “the effect of increasing category 4 to 5 storms” will lead to “a 30% increase in potential damage in the Atlantic basin by 2100”. And that figure does not take into account the futher sea level rises predicted by Nasa.", 'title': 'Hurricane Maria: is climate change to blame?', 'url': 'http://www.theweek.co.uk/climate-change/88448/hurricane-maria-is-climate-change-to-blame', 'keywords': ['scientists', 'climate', 'storms', 'change', 'warm', 'hurricanes', 'maria', 'air', 'blame', 'hurricane', 'atlantic', 'wind'], 'tags': {'Climate change'}, 'summary': 'The record-smashing 2017 Atlantic hurricane season has witnessed some of the most powerful storms ever formed in the Atlantic basin, raising questions about the impact of climate change on our planet.\nThe surge in the intensity and frequency of deadly cyclones has sparked debate about whether climate change caused by humans is to blame, or whether it is merely coincidence.\nProfessor Joanna Haigh, from the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment, in London, told BBC Newsnight that global warming could be viewed in a different light.\nFrom observations alone, “we will never be able to say, ‘This event could only have happened due to climate change’”, she said, but “we can say that the likelihood of certain events occurring has changed due to climate change, and that would be extreme rainfall”.\nPredicting the futureMost scientists are wary of jumping to conclusions about climate change and hurricane trends, but there does appear to be consensus about the future outlook.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'After months of heat, humidity and power outages, long, blown-straight hair is hard to come by – inspiring new looks crafted at improvised barber shops\n\nNot long after Hurricane Maria tore through Puerto Rico, unleashing floodwaters, flattening homes and knocking out the power supply, Consuelo Quezada noticed another, more subtle, change to life on the island.\n\nAttending her first mass after the storm, Quezada saw that her fellow churchgoers did not have their usual Sunday morning hairstyles.\n\n“I think I just saw everyone’s real hair for the first time in my life,” she told her family after the service.\n\nFour months after the hurricane made landfall, ordinary life in the US territory is still far from normal: about 60,000 homes are still without roofs, 2.3 million people live in areas at risk of water contamination, and 15.5% of the population still lacks electricity.\n\nThe island, already billions of dollars in debt before the storm, faces a repair bill of some $94bn.

We charged them every day in our cars or the Walmart across the parking lot.”\n\n\n\nEven now, power has been restored to less than 64% of homes and businesses, according to the latest data from the US Department of Energy.\n\nAcross the island, barbers and stylists have shifted their business out of unventilated shops and on to the cooler sidewalks.\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People cut hair in an improvised outdoor barber shop after a business was damaged by the passing of Hurricane Maria in Toa Baja, Puerto Rico.

Miguel Camilo, from Guaynabo, described how a neighbour gave haircuts to his friends in exchange for a power generator.\n\n“As soon as he got a generator, he set up a tent on his driveway, put out a chair, and gave haircuts to anyone who wanted it,” said Camilo.\n\nTowns and villages in the poorer interior of the island have had to wait much longer to have electricity, phone coverage and other normal services restored.\n\nAlexander Carrasquillo, a pharmaceutical industry supervisor from Yabucoa, took action by creating De Corazón a Corazón (From Heart to Heart), a family and friends’ movement with more than 30 volunteers aimed at bringing aid to hard-struck municipalities such as Utuado, Arroyo, Lares and Las Piedras.\n\nAlong with providing basic necessities, the group also brought medical and legal services – and hairstyling.\n\n“It was special because you could see their faces after they got their haircuts,” said Carrasquillo. “You could see how their self-esteem increased and gave them a more resilient attitude towards their current status. It lifted their spirit.”\n\n\n\nBefore the aid brigade visited a town, community leaders took the names of every person who wanted a haircut; in some towns the waiting list had as many as 80 or 90 people.\n\n“We offered basic haircut services to people who really needed it because we wanted to help the community. We didn’t do any hair dying or extra services because we didn’t want to take any business away from local salons. Besides, we were working in basketball courts and using one portable power generator that could barely power our trimmers,” said David Rivera Manzano, who volunteered with the aid brigade.\n\nAfter the group received a donation from a church in Florida, Carrasquillo also gave (of $10 or $20) to each person who received a haircut. But not everyone took the payment.\n\n“Some of them were too humble,” Carrasquillo said. “They didn’t want to accept the money. They were happy with just a haircut.”', 'title': 'How Hurricane Maria forced Puerto Ricans to change their hair', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/24/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-hairstyles', 'keywords': ['ricans', 'gave', 'services', 'power', 'change', 'forced', 'months', 'maria', 'hair', 'hurricane', 'haircut', 'men', 'puerto', 'long'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Amid this devastation, the disaster has also forced smaller changes to day-to-day life – including the way Puerto Ricans style their hair.\nWomen with long hair pull it into a ponytail or a bun, or even hide it under a cap.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People cut hair in an improvised outdoor barber shop after a business was damaged by the passing of Hurricane Maria in Toa Baja, Puerto Rico.\n“We offered basic haircut services to people who really needed it because we wanted to help the community.\nWe didn’t do any hair dying or extra services because we didn’t want to take any business away from local salons.', 'date': 1516752000}, {'text': 'Richard Davila, the owner of Martinizing Dry Cleaning in Humacao, next to the ironing press machine at his still-shuttered shop.

She’s been there for 20 years, but the post-hurricane realities of life are forcing her to abandon everything she’s known and worked for over the last two decades.\n\nAs Hurricane Maria pounded the island with sustained winds of 155 mph, it destroyed homes and uprooted trees. Pastrana hunkered down in her home, hoping for the best.\n\n“It is very difficult to be able to withstand that emotionally, and also just thinking about your families and your loved ones,” she recalled.\n\nThe storm knocked out power to the entire island. In her community and at the university, Pastrana said, everybody was as prepared as they could be with lots of extra water and power generators.\n\n“Waking up that following day — and you’re used to using cell phones, you’re used to using electricity, you’re used to using water from your faucet — and, all of a sudden, all of that is gone.”\n\nPastrana said most of the buildings in her region on the east coast of the island were left intact. However, access to resources was limited as lines for food, water and gas to power generators started to form everywhere.\n\nPastrana, who researches proteins that are used in medications for Parkinson’s, cancer and other illnesses, owns a startup company that’s working to develop a microscopelike device to study these proteins and how they might react when used in humans.\n\nWhen she was finally able to check on her labs, she found devastation. The substances she uses in her experiments were ruined.\n\n“We lost all reagents that had to be refrigerated or frozen, $250,000 worth of reagents that were very unique because they were designed and built and made in our lab,” she said.\n\nAll of the backup systems to preserve power had failed.\n\nPastrana said she is now forced to start over in many ways and she is relocating her lab to the mainland because she needs a reliable power supply to do her work.
