[{'text': 'In New Orleans, most of the levees held, but one was damaged. Floodwaters rose to rooftops in one neighborhood, and in many areas emergency workers pulled residents from roofs. The hurricane\'s howling winds stripped 15-foot sections off the roof of the Superdome, where as many as 10,000 evacuees took shelter.\n\nSome of the worst damage reports came from east of New Orleans with an estimated 40,000 homes reported flooded in St. Bernard Parish. In Gulfport, the storm left three of five hospitals without working emergency rooms, beachfront homes wrecked and major stretches of the coastal highway flooded and unpassable.\n\n"It came on Mississippi like a ton of bricks," Gov. Haley Barbour said at a midday news conference "It\'s a terrible storm."\n\nPresident Bush promised extensive assistance for hurricane victims, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency was expected to be working in the area for months, assessing damage to properties and allocating what is likely to be billions of dollars in aid to homeowners and businesses.\n\nIn Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi, the governors declared search and rescue their top priority, but they said high waters and strong winds were keeping them from that task, particularly in the hardest-hit areas.\n\nThe governors sent out the police and the National Guard after reports of looting, and officials in some parts of Louisiana said they would impose a curfew.\n\nHurricane Katrina was downgraded from Category 5 -- the most dangerous storm -- to Category 4 as it hit land in eastern Louisiana just after 6 a.m., and in New Orleans officials said the storm\'s slight shift to the east had spared them somewhat. The city is below sea level, and there had been predictions that the historic French Quarter would be under 18 or 20 feet of water.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, no one was finding much comfort here, with 100 m.p.h. winds and water surges of up to 15 feet. Officials said early in the day that more than 20 buildings had been toppled.\n\n"I can\'t say that we\'ve escaped the worst," Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco said. "I think there is still damage that can be inflicted on the city. We don\'t even know what the worst is."\n\nPreliminary damage estimates from the hurricane -- which raked across southern Florida last week as a Category 1 storm before reaching the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and making its run at the Gulf Coast -- ranged from $9 billion to $16 billion. Only Hurricane Andrew, which ripped through parts of Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi in August 1992, was costlier -- with nearly $21 billion in insured losses.\n\nBeyond the property damage caused by flooding and the high winds, Hurricane Katrina also dealt a blow to the oil industry and the lucrative casinos that have been the economic engine for the region. Both oil production on offshore platforms and gambling in the string of casinos that dot the Mississippi Gulf Coast shut down on Sunday as the storm approached.\n\nSince Friday, oil output in the Gulf of Mexico has been cut by 3.1 million barrels. Closing the casinos cost Mississippi $400,000 to $500,000 a day in lost tax revenue alone, and Mr. Barbour said officials had not yet been able to determine the extent of damage to the casinos.\n\nThe storm pounded New Orleans for eight hours straight. Flooding overwhelmed levees built to protect the city from the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain, sending muddy water swirling into the narrow streets downtown. On the southern shore of the lake, entire neighborhoods of one-story homes were flooded to the rooflines, with nearby off-ramps for Interstate 10 looking like boat ramps amid the waves.\n\nAlong the lake were snapped telephone poles, trees blocking roads and live wires scattered over the roads. In one cabin, a family was cooking a chicken dinner over charcoal briquettes on a hibachi. They had lost power like everyone else in the area.\n\nWindows were blown off condominiums, hotels, office buildings and Charity Hospital, sending chards of glass into the winds. Fires broke out despite torrential rain, some ignited, the authorities said, by residents who lighted candles after the electricity went out.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe storm knocked out telephone and cellular service across swaths of the gulf region, and officials in New Orleans said parts of the city could remain without power for weeks.\n\nTwo nuclear plants near the path of Hurricane Katrina appear to have weathered the storm without major damage, and a third shut down on Saturday, in anticipation of the hurricane, according to Entergy Nuclear, which owns all three. The extent of damage to the plant that shut down, Waterford, 20 miles west of New Orleans, was still unknown late Monday afternoon because the wind was blowing too hard to go out and look, said Diane Park, a spokeswoman.\n\nThe more sparsely populated parishes east of New Orleans, meanwhile, got hit much harder than anyone had expected.\n\nMs. Blanco said Plaquemines, Orleans, St. Bernard, Jefferson and St. Tammany Parishes had been "devastated by high winds and floodwaters." In St. Bernard, the emergency center was submerged, and officials estimated that 40,000 homes, too, were flooded.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you\'re not a robot by clicking the box.

But in areas that had been expecting less damage, officials were worried -- and annoyed -- that large numbers of people tried to ride out the storm.\n\nIn Plaquemines and Terrebonne Parishes, south and west of the city, officials said they were particularly concerned about commercial fisherman who had decided to remain on their boats.\n\n"My biggest concern is the loss of life," said State Senator Walter J. Boasso. "We have a lot of people down there hiding in their attics, and I don\'t know if we will get to them fast enough."\n\nIn Mississippi, Mr. Barbour said many people suffered from what he called "hurricane fatigue," deciding not to evacuate this time after having done so in the past only to be spared.\n\n"We pray that those people are O.K.," he said. "But we don\'t know."\n\nIn Diamondhead, Miss., Don Haller and his 17-year-old son, Don Jr., were left clinging to the remains of their house when a 23-foot surge of water hit it, flexing the roof like a deck of cards.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThey had decided against evacuating, Mr. Haller said, judging the storm "just a lot of rain."\n\n"We rode the house," Mr. Haller said, emerging from the waters here, his son carrying their dachshund, Kuddles.\n\nMr. Barbour said casinos along the coast near Biloxi and Gulfport had been hit by surges of more than 20 feet. But casino workers could not reach them to survey the damage, he said, because U.S. 90 had "essentially been destroyed."\n\nAlong the coast in Mobile, Ala., 150 miles east of New Orleans, thousands of evacuees from Mississippi and Louisiana were filling shelters and the hotels that had remained open.\n\nThe lowest-lying areas of Mobile and Baldwin Counties in Alabama were evacuated on Sunday night. By noon, areas south of Interstate 10 were already flooding, and the storm surge was pushing the water toward the city of Mobile and Mobile Bay as the hurricane progressed.\n\nDowntown Mobile, which is right on the bay, was severely flooded by Monday afternoon, the water pushing down the main streets around the county courthouse and lapping at the sandbagged doors and windows at the Mobile Museum. Water all but covered a number of street signs and parking meters, and large, heavy planters and some newspaper boxes floated down the streets.\n\nThe main hotels in the city were just a block or two from the worst flooding, causing concerns that they, too, would be flooded, at least in the main floors. And as power and phone lines went down, evacuees were getting restless.\n\nPaul Weir said he had not left his home in Meraux, La., just outside New Orleans, during a storm since Hurricane Betsy in 1965, and left on Sunday morning only after hearing that Hurricane Katrina was a Category 5. He drove with his wife, daughter and four friends to Mobile; with roads clogged with other residents fleeing, what is normally a three-hour drive took 12.\n\nBy Monday afternoon the family was obsessing about what they would find when they got home.\n\n"If I was home, I would\'ve went on a roof for two days just like everybody else," said Susan Weir, Mr. Weir\'s wife, said. "I\'d rather be in that situation than here, honestly. This is expensive and I\'ve only got a credit card with a $2,000 limit."\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the Ramada Hotel in downtown Mobile, Edith Frieson sat anxiously in a soggy room wondering why her husband had not returned. "He left maybe three hours ago to go down and see if he could check the house," said Mrs. Frieson, who lives on Dauphin Island, a narrow barrier island south of Mobile. The island was already flooding on Sunday afternoon.\n\nLike most storms, Hurricane Katrina weakened as it came onshore, and by Monday evening the National Hurricane Center had downgraded it to a tropical storm. The center of the storm had moved its heavy rains toward Jackson, Miss.\n\nBut state officials said the hurricane had been an unusually large one, causing a wide swath of damage, and they expected to be dealing with damage for days if not weeks.\n\nIn Louisiana, Ms. Blanco pleaded with residents who had evacuated not to rush back.\n\n"The roads are flooded, the power is out, the phones are down and there is no food or water, and many trees are down," she said.\n\n"Wherever you live, it is still too dangerous for people to return home," she continued. "If you evacuated and you\'re in a shelter, if you\'re with friends and family, please, please stay there. Stay safe."\n\nMichael D. Brown, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, reminded people that most injuries from hurricanes occurred after the storm had passed.\n\n"Be careful," Mr. Brown said, standing next to the governor at a news conference. "Don\'t get in that water. Watch for downed power lines. If you\'re going to use a chainsaw, know how to use a chainsaw. If you\'re going to have a generator, know how to exercise and operate the generator. Be very, very careful. The storm is not over."\n\nMr. Brown also discouraged fire and emergency agencies outside the storm area from sending in crews unless they had been asked.\n\nEven before the hurricane hit the New Orleans area, FEMA had positioned 23 of its disaster medical assistance teams and 7 search and rescue teams around the region. It also delivered generators, and stockpiles of water, ice and ready-to-eat meals. It even sent in two teams of veterinarians to provide care to any injured pets or other animals.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs of early Monday, about 52,000 people were in 240 shelters in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Florida and Texas, with the majority in the Superdome in New Orleans.', 'title': 'Hurricane Katrina Slams Into Gulf Coast; Dozens Are Dead', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/30/us/hurricane-katrina-slams-into-gulf-coast-dozens-are-dead.html', 'keywords': ['water', 'katrina', 'slams', 'orleans', 'main', 'louisiana', 'mobile', 'storm', 'coast', 'gulf', 'dozens', 'hurricane', 'dead', 'mississippi', 'officials', 'damage'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Only Hurricane Andrew, which ripped through parts of Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi in August 1992, was costlier -- with nearly $21 billion in insured losses.\nBoth oil production on offshore platforms and gambling in the string of casinos that dot the Mississippi Gulf Coast shut down on Sunday as the storm approached.\nBut in areas that had been expecting less damage, officials were worried -- and annoyed -- that large numbers of people tried to ride out the storm.\nMr. Barbour said casinos along the coast near Biloxi and Gulfport had been hit by surges of more than 20 feet.\nLike most storms, Hurricane Katrina weakened as it came onshore, and by Monday evening the National Hurricane Center had downgraded it to a tropical storm.', 'date': 1125360000}, {'text': "Animated guide: How Hurricanes form\n\nAfter crossing southern Florida - where it left some 100,000 homes without power - it strengthened further before veering inland towards Louisiana, eventually making landfall at Grand Isle, approximately 90km south of New Orleans, at 10am local time on 29 August.\n\nAt this point, Katrina's sustained wind speed was approximately 200 km/h.

The report documents the experiences of thousands of men, women and children who were abandoned at Orleans Parish Prison (OPP) in the days after the storm.\n\n\n\n"The prisoners inside the Orleans Parish Prison suffered some of the worst horrors of Hurricane Katrina," said Eric Balaban, a staff attorney for the National Prison Project. "Because society views prisoners as second-class citizens, their stories have largely gone unnoticed and therefore untold."\n\n\n\nIn conjunction with the report\'s release, the National Prison Project urged the president to direct the Department of Justice to evaluate OPP\'s current evacuation plans in an effort to determine whether any meaningful improvements have been made over the past year. The ACLU also asked Congress to audit the jail\'s emergency preparedness plans. The ACLU is calling for a full and immediate investigation into abuses at Louisiana correctional facilities during and after the storm and is also urging the DOJ to make the findings from such an investigation public and accessible to state and federal prosecutors.\n\n\n\nThe ACLU report describes a history of neglect at Orleans Parish Prison, one of the most dangerous and mismanaged jails in the country. This culture of neglect was evident in the days before Katrina, when the sheriff declared that the prisoners would remain "where they belong," despite the mayor\'s decision to declare the city\'s first-ever mandatory evacuation. OPP even accepted prisoners, including juveniles as young as 10, from other facilities to ride out the storm.\n\n\n\nAs floodwaters rose in the OPP buildings, power was lost, and entire buildings were plunged into darkness. Deputies left their posts wholesale, leaving behind prisoners in locked cells, some standing in sewage-tainted water up to their chests.\n\n\n\n"The sheriff\'s office was completely unprepared for the storm," said Tom Jawetz, Litigation Fellow for the National Prison Project. "The Louisiana Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals did more for its 263 stray pets than the sheriff did for the more than 6,500 men, women and children left in his care."\n\n\n\nPrisoners went days without food, water and ventilation, and deputies admit that they received no emergency training and were entirely unaware of any evacuation plan. Even some prison guards were left locked in at their posts to fend for themselves, unable to provide assistance to prisoners in need.\n\n\n\nThe prisoners were finally evacuated by order of the state after days of fear and chaos. The report follows the prisoners as they were transferred to jails and prisons around Louisiana. Thousands of the men were first transported to the Elayn Hunt Correctional Center, where they were placed outdoors in a yard with inadequate food, medical care, and protection from other prisoners, many of whom were armed with makeshift weapons. According to the report, at several other facilities, prisoners were subjected to systematic abuse and racially motivated assaults by prison guards.\n\n\n\n"Some prisoners at Hunt attacked other prisoners, and guards did nothing to prevent this from happening," said Katie Schwartzmann, a staff attorney for the ACLU of Louisiana. "Guards threatened prisoners with guns when they were approached for help, and shot at one prisoner who had been stabbed by a group of other prisoners."\n\n\n\nAmong the people profiled in the ACLU report are:\n\n\n\nIvy Gisclair, who was being held at OPP for $700 in traffic violations (mostly parking tickets) and had never been in any serious trouble with the law. After days in OPP following the storm, Ivy was transferred to Hunt, where he witnessed stabbings, rapes and countless fights. Ivy was finally transferred to Bossier Parish Maximum Security Prison. His release date came and went. When he asked a guard about it, he was pepper sprayed, repeatedly shocked with a Taser, beaten by multiple guards, and put in solitary confinement with no clothes. Ivy was released in an orange prison jumpsuit at a gas station by the side of the road, three weeks after his scheduled release date. It was the day of Hurricane Rita.\n\nRenard Reed, a guard at OPP\'s psychiatric ward who reported to work before the hurricane out of a sense of camaraderie and shared responsibility. Like many other guards, Renard was locked in during his shift to prevent desertion, and was then ordered to go to the roof with a shotgun and shoot anyone trying to leave one of the flooded buildings. He was still stranded at the prison long after the prisoners were evacuated.\n\nAshley George, a 13-year-old girl housed in OPP\'s Youth Center, who was moved to an area adjacent to an adult male holding area where the men watched her use the toilet. As the building began to flood, Ashley spent days in water up to her neck. Adult prisoners rescued Ashley and the other children from the waters. After being taken to the bridge for evacuation, Ashley was lucky enough to be given a bag of potato chips and water. She reports again being forced to relieve herself publicly and that pregnant girls received no assistance or treatment.\n\n"These are the untold horrors of Hurricane Katrina," Balaban said. "We must preserve these stories to create a record of the tragedy and to ensure that the mistakes detailed in this report are never repeated."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'title': 'ACLU Report Details Horrors Suffered by Orleans Parish Prisoners in Wake of Hurricane Katrina', 'url': 'https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-report-details-horrors-suffered-orleans-parish-prisoners-wake-hurricane-katrina', 'keywords': ['parish', 'orleans', 'katrina', 'horrors', 'prison', 'project', 'days', 'opp', 'suffered', 'prisoners', 'hurricane', 'wake', 'details', 'report'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASECONTACT: media@aclu.orgNational Prison Project Calls for Immediate Action by President, Congress and Justice DepartmentNEW ORLEANS -- As the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina approaches, the American Civil Liberties Union\'s National Prison Project today released Abandoned & Abused: Orleans Parish Prisoners in the Wake of Hurricane Katrina.\nThe report documents the experiences of thousands of men, women and children who were abandoned at Orleans Parish Prison (OPP) in the days after the storm.\n"The prisoners inside the Orleans Parish Prison suffered some of the worst horrors of Hurricane Katrina," said Eric Balaban, a staff attorney for the National Prison Project.\nThe ACLU report describes a history of neglect at Orleans Parish Prison, one of the most dangerous and mismanaged jails in the country.\n"These are the untold horrors of Hurricane Katrina," Balaban said.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'Hurricane Katrina was the most destructive natural disaster in U.S. history. Check out these facts on the monster storm:\n\n• The overall destruction wrought by Hurricane Katrina, which was both a large and powerful hurricane as well as a catastrophic flood, vastly exceeded that of any other major disaster, such as the Chicago Fire of 1871, the San Francisco Earthquake and Fire of 1906, and Hurricane Andrew in 1992.\n\n• In the Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Katrina battered the offshore energy infrastructure and forced the evacuation of more than 75 percent of the Gulf’s 819 manned oil platforms.\n\n• Two days before landfall, U.S. energy companies estimated that the approaching storm had already reduced Gulf of Mexico oil production by more than a third.\n\n• In all, Hurricane Katrina affected nearly 93,000 square miles across 138 parishes and counties.\n\n• Hurricane Katrina’s winds and a storm surge that crested up to 27 feet high dealt a ferocious blow to homes, businesses, and property on the coast and for many miles inland.\n\n• This storm surge overwhelmed levees all along the lowest reaches of the Mississippi River and the edges of Lake Pontchartrain.\n\n• The consequences for New Orleans, which sits mostly below sea level, were dire. Significant levee failures occurred on the 17th Street Canal, the Industrial Canal, and the London Avenue Canal. Approximately 80 percent of the city was flooded. The flooding destroyed New Orleans, the Nation’s thirty-fifth largest city.\n\n• From Morgan City, Louisiana, to Biloxi, Mississippi, to Mobile, Alabama, Hurricane Katrina’s wind, rain, and storm surge demolished homes and businesses. Large parts of the coastal areas of these States were devastated.\n\n• Katrina caused an estimated $96 billion dollars in damage.\n\n• The American Insurance Services Group (AISG) estimates that Katrina is responsible for $40.6 billion of insured losses in the United States\n\n• Estimated damage from Hurricane Katrina and the New Orleans Flood: Housing — $67 billion; Consumer durable goods — $7 billion; Business property — $20 billion; Government property — $3 billion\n\n• Hurricane Katrina devastated far more residential property than had any other recent hurricane, completely destroying or making uninhabitable an estimated 300,000 homes.\n\n• Katrina far surpasses the residential damage of Hurricane Andrew, which destroyed or damaged approximately 80,000 homes in 1992. It even exceeds the combined damage of the four major 2004 hurricanes, Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne, which together destroyed or damaged approximately 85,000 homes.\n\n• The storm destroyed so many homes, buildings, forests, and green spaces that an extraordinary amount of debris was left behind — 118 million cubic yards all told. In comparison, Hurricane Andrew created 20 million cubic yards of debris.\n\n• The debris from Katrina, if stacked onto the space of a football field, would reach over ten and a half miles high.\n\nHurricane Katrina: The Human Toll\n\n• When the winds and floods of Hurricane Katrina subsided, an estimated 1,833 people died directly or indirectly died from Katrina: (National Hurricane Center – Aug 10, 2006)\n\n• The vast majority of the fatalities — an estimated 80 percent — came from the New Orleans metropolitan area\n\n• 1,464 deaths in Louisiana from Katrina (LA Dept of Health)\n\n• Mississippi suffered greatly as well, with 238 fatalities (MS Dept of Health)\n\n• 14 deaths in Florida (CDC, March 2006)\n\n• 2 deaths in Alabama\n\n• 2 deaths in Georgia from Katrina\n\n• In Louisiana, approximately 71 percent of the victims were older than sixty, and 47 percent of those were over seventy-five. At least sixty-eight were found in nursing homes, some of whom were allegedly abandoned by their caretakers.\n\n• Of the total known fatalities, there are almost two hundred unclaimed bodies remaining at the Victim Identification Center in Carville, Louisiana.\n\n• As of August 8, 2006, there were 135 people from Louisiana still reported as missing.\n\n• Around 770,000 people were displaced — the largest since the Dust Bowl migration from the southern Great Plains region in the 1930s.\n\n• Many victims found it difficult to reconstruct their shattered lives. In many cases, they had either lost or forgotten basic documents, such as insurance information, birth certificates, and marriage licenses, which would later prove essential to rebuilding their lives. Most of the evacuees did not have access to their medical records, which increased the risk of complications when receiving medical treatment.52 For those who returned to their homes in the Gulf region, basic services were still wanting.\n\n• By January 2006, 85 percent of public schools in Orleans parish had still not reopened; in the metropolitan area, approximately two-thirds of the retail food establishments, half of the bus routes, and half of the major hospitals remained closed.\n\n• Of the 1.1 million people over the age of sixteen who evacuated in August 2005, approximately 500,000 of those evacuees had not returned home by late December.\n\n(Sources: The White House, THE FEDERAL RESPONSE TO HURRICANE KATRINA, FEBRUARY 2006, http://www.whitehouse.gov/reports/katrina-lessons-learned.pdf; National Hurricane Center – August 10, 2006, http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/ms-word/TCR-AL122005_Katrina.doc; Louisiana Department of Health, Aug 2, 2006, http://www.dhh.louisiana.gov/offices/page.asp?ID=192&Detail=5248; CDC, Mar 2006, Mortality Associated with Hurricane Katrina —- Florida and Alabama, August—October 2005, http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5509a5.htm; Louisiana Family Assistance Center - Missing People, http://www.familyassist.us/index.php?p=N3p2ZmZ2YXRzNDguY3Vj&t=Missing%20People; National Hurricane Center, August 10, 2006, Tropical Cyclone Report Hurricane Katrina)', 'title': 'FOX Facts: Hurricane Katrina Damage', 'url': 'http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/08/29/fox-facts-hurricane-katrina-damage.html', 'keywords': ['katrina', 'orleans', 'fox', '2006', 'approximately', 'louisiana', 'storm', 'billion', 'facts', 'homes', 'hurricane', 'estimated', 'damage'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Hurricane Katrina was the most destructive natural disaster in U.S. history.\n• In the Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Katrina battered the offshore energy infrastructure and forced the evacuation of more than 75 percent of the Gulf’s 819 manned oil platforms.\n• In all, Hurricane Katrina affected nearly 93,000 square miles across 138 parishes and counties.\n• Katrina far surpasses the residential damage of Hurricane Andrew, which destroyed or damaged approximately 80,000 homes in 1992.\n(Sources: The White House, THE FEDERAL RESPONSE TO HURRICANE KATRINA, FEBRUARY 2006, http://www.whitehouse.gov/reports/katrina-lessons-learned.pdf; National Hurricane Center – August 10, 2006, http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/ms-word/TCR-AL122005_Katrina.doc; Louisiana Department of Health, Aug 2, 2006, http://www.dhh.louisiana.gov/offices/page.asp?ID=192&Detail=5248; CDC, Mar 2006, Mortality Associated with Hurricane Katrina —- Florida and Alabama, August—October 2005, http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5509a5.htm; Louisiana Family Assistance Center - Missing People, http://www.familyassist.us/index.php?p=N3p2ZmZ2YXRzNDguY3Vj&t=Missing%20People; National Hurricane Center, August 10, 2006, Tropical Cyclone Report Hurricane Katrina)', 'date': 1156809600}, {'text': 'The human suffering from Hurricane Katrina and the images of mostly black hurricane victims and looters have provoked new debates about tough public policy decisions, the nation\'s troubled racial history and the racial and economic barriers that still separate Americans.\n\nCBS Radio News reports that New Orleans City Councilman Oliver Thomas said people are too afraid of black people to go in and save them.

The animals were killed when the facility lost power and the staff had to evacuate. A small staff is tending to the surviving animals and preparing to move them out of the facility, which is at the foot of Canal Street along the Mississippi River. The Aquarium of the Americas was considered one of the foremost aquariums in the world, the conservation Web site Mongabay.com said. "It had 10,000 fish representing more than 530 species and featured four enormous exhibits -- Mississippi River gallery featuring catfish, paddlefish and alligators; the Caribbean Reef exhibit featuring a clear, 30-foot-long tunnel surrounded by aquatic creatures; the Amazon Rainforest display featuring piranhas and tropical birds; and the Gulf of Mexico exhibit featuring sharks, sea turtles and stingrays -- in addition to a number of smaller displays." Some animals survived the loss of power, the American Zoo and Aquarium Association Web site reported. "The sea otters, penguins, leafy and weedy sea dragons, birds (macaws and raptors), and the white alligator are fine," the association said on its Web site "Midas, the infamous 250-pound sea turtle, survived and has been coaxed into the holding area in the Gulf of Mexico Exhibit," the association said. Air pumps are key for an aquarium, according to Mongabay.com. "Aquatic plants, animals, and waste-converting bacteria all depend on oxygen dissolved in water for respiration." Zoos weather storm better Meanwhile, New Orleans\' other animal centers fared better, with only a pair of river otters reported dead at the Audubon Zoo and a whooping crane lost at the Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species. "From what I understand, we didn\'t take any water," zoo spokeswoman Sarah Burnette told CNN on Sunday. Most of the damage to the zoo -- which houses about 1,200 animals in natural habitats -- appeared to be limited to uprooted trees and plants, she said. A crocodile from the research center was missing, said Rhett A. Butler, a conservationist and founder of the Web site mongabay.com. The Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species is several miles from the zoo on New Orleans\' West Bank. The American Association of Zoo Keepers said Sunday that other zoos in the Gulf Coast area fared well too, though the threat was not over. "We are thankful that most of the reports we have received about the zoos and aquariums in the area are hopeful," the association said on its Web site. "It is still too early to assess the full impact and the danger is not over yet for some areas. Flooding continues to be a problem and is actually increasing in the worst-hit areas." Burnette said the zoo took pointers from the Miami zoo after deadly Hurricane Andrew struck in 1992, then the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history. "We have worked closely with Miami MetroZoo ever since Hurricane Andrew, and we totally revised our hurricane plan after talking to them. We have a protocol we go through whenever we know something\'s brewing," she said. In anticipation of Hurricane Katrina, the New Orleans zoo stockpiled fuel, food and other supplies, Burnette said. When it hit last Monday, the staff fled to the sturdy reptile building and raided the cafeteria for food. Some staff remained at the zoo, she said. "We did plan well, but I think we also were really fortunate to be on the natural bank of the Mississippi River," Burnette said. The land is on higher ground than other parts of New Orleans, which is several feet below sea level. In the center of the zoo is a 28-foot, man-made "mountain" that was built decades ago when lagoons were dug, she said. Meanwhile, the 211-member American Zoo and Aquarium Association began a fund-raising initiative, headed by the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago, to provide relief. The association posted on its Web site what it knew about the status of zoos in the hurricane\'s path: New Orleans (Audubon Zoo), Louisiana: Audubon Nature Institute executive staff continue to assess the impact of Hurricane Katrina on all Audubon facilities. Audubon staff are working round the clock on recovery efforts. Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Zoo: Power is back on at the zoo. There are lots of trees down, but no animal losses. Cleanup efforts are under way. Alexandria, Louisiana, Zoo: No animal loss. Jackson, Mississippi, Zoo: The zoo suffered slight building damage and has about 35 trees down. No injuries to staff or animals. Birmingham, Alabama, Zoo: The zoo was without power for a day, but power is restored. Trees down, but no animal losses. Montgomery, Alabama, Zoo: The zoo has resumed operations. There are trees down, but no animal losses.

"A lot of the hurricane damage along the Mississippi coastline came from storm surges -- not from high winds or levee flooding that occurred in the New Orleans area," said Yin Lu "Julie" Young, an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at Princeton University. "Storm surges result in very different mechanisms. When it comes to forces on a structure, what happens in a storm surge is very similar to what happens in a tsunami."\n\nDuring a storm surge, structures that were built to withstand the downward force of gravity now must cope with a totally different force: the upward and lateral push of water. In addition, buildings have to withstand assaults from debris caught up in the surge.\n\n"Eighteen-wheeler containers, freed floating barges, and boats can all become projectiles that will strike objects in their path," said Young. "Large debris may also become lodged between structural elements like columns and lead to complete collapse of the structures."\n\nYoung\'s collaborators are Ronald Riggs and Ian Robertson, professors at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and Solomon Yim, a professor at Oregon State University. The team members will publish their work in an upcoming special edition of the Journal of Waterway, Port, Coastal and Ocean Engineering.\n\nDuring their two field visits, the team took more than 2,000 photographs of the destruction to the Mississippi coast. One of Young\'s favorites is a photograph of a stack of delicate unchipped china that survived the storm completely unharmed. All that remains of the church where the china was used is a bent steel frame. "You have to appreciate the irony of nature," Young said. "Most of the time, the scenery is tragic, ironic, and beautiful all at the same time."\n\nOne of the group\'s interesting research findings from the Mississippi work has to do with a phenomenon better known for occurring in neither hurricanes nor tsunamis but, rather, earthquakes. That is something known as "liquefaction." As the storm surge recedes, the sudden decrease in downward pressure on the saturated soil causes the sand to liquefy and flow out like a heavy slurry. This can lead to the eventual collapse of buildings, highways, or bridge abutments, as well as gigantic potholes along coastal roads.\n\nThe team was awarded a NSF NEES-SG grant to study the effect of tsunamis on engineered structures. The final goal of the project is to develop design recommendations to enhance the safety of coastal infrastructures subject to tsunamis.\n\n"If you consider the gravitation, wind, seismic and wave forces, as well as the surrounding soil composition, a building can be designed such that it should be available for immediate occupancy after a minor event, and be able to remain structurally intact to allow for safe evacuation during a Category 3 hurricane like Katrina," said Young.\n\nUnderstanding how to build hurricane-resistant buildings is one thing; getting society to implement that knowledge is quite another, Young said. "Politics and human values come into play," she said. "People are resilient and have short memories and think that if another hurricane comes along they can just rebuild. I admire their strength but at the same time there is a certain stubbornness about not learning from past mistakes. People like to do what they did before because it\'s easier than fixing the root of the problem."\n\nLast week, Young gave a presentation on her research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will also be giving presentations at the Oregon State University, California Institute of Technology, the University of Southern California, and the University of California at Berkeley. "We hope to present our findings widely so that engineers can learn from this and modify future design codes to minimize damage," she said.\n\nFurther Information\n\n\n\nTitle: Lessons from Hurricane Katrina Storm Surge on Bridges and Buildings, By Ian N. Robertson, H. Ronald Riggs, Solomon Yim and Yin Lu Young.\n\nAbstract : The storm surge associated with Hurricane Katrina caused tremendous damage along the Gulf Coast in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. Similar damage was observed subsequent to the Indian Ocean Tsunami of December 26, 2004. In order to gain a better understanding of the performance of engineered structures subjected to coastal inundation due to tsunami or hurricane storm surge, the authors surveyed damage to bridges, buildings and other coastal infrastructure subsequent to Hurricane Katrina. Numerous lessons were learned from analysis of the observed damage, and these are reported herein. A number of structures experienced significant structural damage due to storm surge and wave action. Structural members submerged during the inundation were subjected to significant hydrostatic uplift forces due to buoyancy, enhanced by trapped air pockets, and hydrodynamic uplift forces due to wave action. Any floating or mobile object in the nearshore/on-shore areas can become floating debris, affecting structures in two ways: impact and water-damming. Foundation soils and foundation systems are at risk from shear- and liquefaction-induced scour, unless designed appropriately.', 'title': 'Hurricane Katrina And 2004 Tsunami Caused Surprisingly Similar Destruction', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/04/070411110017.htm', 'keywords': ['surge', 'katrina', 'forces', 'university', 'structures', 'caused', 'destruction', '2004', 'tsunami', 'storm', 'damage', 'similar', 'hurricane', 'young', 'coastal', 'surprisingly'], 'tags': {'Hurricanes and Cyclones', 'Engineering', 'Natural Disasters', 'Construction', 'Engineering and Construction', 'Severe Weather', 'Floods', 'Civil Engineering'}, 'summary': 'When it comes to forces on a structure, what happens in a storm surge is very similar to what happens in a tsunami."\nDuring a storm surge, structures that were built to withstand the downward force of gravity now must cope with a totally different force: the upward and lateral push of water.\nAs the storm surge recedes, the sudden decrease in downward pressure on the saturated soil causes the sand to liquefy and flow out like a heavy slurry.\nFurther InformationTitle: Lessons from Hurricane Katrina Storm Surge on Bridges and Buildings, By Ian N.

It is inspiring to see how these professionals are giving of their time and expertise to help families through the difficult process of finding the loved ones that Katrina so cruelly took away,” said NHGRI Scientific Director Eric D. Green, M.D., Ph.D.\n\nWhen Katrina struck on August 29 and unleashed devastating floods, it claimed more than 1,200 lives in Louisiana and Mississippi. Many of the victims already have been identified and their remains claimed by their families. However, more than 70 bodies remain unidentified, including bodies recovered shortly after the floods receded and bodies recently recovered as debris from the hurricane has been removed from the hardest hit areas of New Orleans.\n\nUsing experience gained in DNA analysis of human remains after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, epidemiologists, clinical geneticists and genetic counselors are supporting Louisiana state officials in the task of collecting data on family relationships, which is a key step in the complex process of DNA testing being used to match recovered remains to the list of more than 1,100 people still missing in Katrina’s wake.\n\nJoan Bailey-Wilson, Ph.D., co-chief of the NHGRI’s Inherited Disease Research Branch, has been coordinating efforts of more than 70 genetics professionals who have offered to help the Louisiana State Police Crime Laboratory in its management of the identification process and collection of DNA (cheek swab) samples from family members of the missing. These professionals come from more than 30 U.S. medical institutions and private practices across the United States.\n\nAlong with Elizabeth Pugh, Ph.D., M.P.H., head of statistical genetics at the Center for Inherited Disease Research, an NIH-funded initiative based at the Johns Hopkins’ Bayview campus in Baltimore, Dr. Bailey-Wilson serves on a panel to advise crime lab staff and the coroners’ offices in both states responsible for identifying the dead and missing. It is a repeat role for the two statistical geneticists, who also served on a panel for the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in New York City after the World Trade Center attacks five years ago. Other NIH personnel serving on both advisory committees include: Leslie Biesecker, M.D., of NHGRI’s Genetic Disease Research Branch, and Stephen Sherry, Ph.D., and Lisa Forman, Ph.D., both of the National Library of Medicine’s National Center for Biotechnology Information.\n\n“Pulling together the infrastructure — from experts in various disciplines and from medical centers across the country — is a skill that forensics experts learned from 9/11. Most of us hoped it was a once-in-a-lifetime event, but sadly it was not,” said Dr. Bailey-Wilson, who is also an adjunct professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.\n\nMany medical and dental records normally used to match bodies with names of the missing were destroyed, leaving few clues behind as to whose remains were found. Even DNA-facilitated identification has proved to be a challenge. Personal items, such as toothbrushes and hairbrushes that could contain saliva and hair samples useful in DNA testing, were often contaminated or destroyed by flooding. Making matters worse, family members whose DNA is required to make a match were displaced by the hurricane, making contact difficult and adding delays to interviews and appointments for genetic testing.\n\n“One of the lessons learned from 9/11 was that talking to the families about the missing is skilled detective work, which is best done by qualified genetics clinicians and genetic counselors who know the right questions to ask based on the information needed to fill in the family pedigree,” said Dr. Pugh, who is also an assistant professor at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, observing that, in today’s world of blended families and multiple marriages, not all siblings are biologically related to one another.\n\nMost of the genetics professionals are being sent to the Louisiana Family Assistance Center in Baton Rouge, La., where investigative operations are based. Once there, they interview relatives by phone to help construct complex family trees of individuals who are presumed lost, a crucial first step in the identification of the dead using DNA testing.\n\nIn DNA identification testing, a person’s unique genetic makeup is matched against other previously known DNA samples, such as stored blood or material taken from toothbrushes or hair combs. If no known samples of DNA exist, DNA is obtained from family members in order to look for unique patterns of genetic traits, or markers, specific to the individual based on the patterns found in the family. In the case of the 2005 hurricane victims, ultimately, the state coroner makes an official identification using results from the DNA analysis alone or in combination with other information, such as distinguishing physical features or the location where the body was found.\n\nCompiling a genetic picture of the family requires an accurate construction of the family tree, which can be built using biological information obtained from siblings, parents, grandparents or cousins.\n\n“This is not an easy task. Taking down the correct information, correctly assessing the nature of relationships, and establishing which relatives are willing to donate DNA is a very sensitive and time-consuming process, especially for large, extended families. But it is a task that needs to be done so that families can finally get some answers about their missing loved ones,” said Barbara Biesecker, M.S., director of the Johns Hopkins/NHGRI Genetic Counseling Training Program, who has traveled to Louisiana with two groups of genetic counseling graduate students.\n\nTracking this process for each missing person and each recovered body involves tremendous attention to detail, added Dr. Pugh, who helped the Louisiana State Police Crime Laboratory’s DNA unit set up one of the computer systems and protocols that will guide the identification process.

It is inspiring to see how these professionals are giving of their time and expertise to help families through the difficult process of finding the loved ones that Katrina so cruelly took away,” said NHGRI Scientific Director Eric D. Green, M.D., Ph.D.\n\nWhen Katrina struck on August 29 and unleashed devastating floods, it claimed more than 1,200 lives in Louisiana and Mississippi. Many of the victims already have been identified and their remains claimed by their families. However, more than 70 bodies remain unidentified, including bodies recovered shortly after the floods receded and bodies recently recovered as debris from the hurricane has been removed from the hardest hit areas of New Orleans.\n\nUsing experience gained in DNA analysis of human remains after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, epidemiologists, clinical geneticists and genetic counselors are supporting Louisiana state officials in the task of collecting data on family relationships, which is a key step in the complex process of DNA testing being used to match recovered remains to the list of more than 1,100 people still missing in Katrina’s wake.\n\nJoan Bailey-Wilson, Ph.D., co-chief of the NHGRI’s Inherited Disease Research Branch, has been coordinating efforts of more than 70 genetics professionals who have offered to help the Louisiana State Police Crime Laboratory in its management of the identification process and collection of DNA (cheek swab) samples from family members of the missing. These professionals come from more than 30 U.S. medical institutions and private practices across the United States.\n\nAlong with Elizabeth Pugh, Ph.D., M.P.H., head of statistical genetics at the Center for Inherited Disease Research, an NIH-funded initiative based at the Johns Hopkins’ Bayview campus in Baltimore, Dr. Bailey-Wilson serves on a panel to advise crime lab staff and the coroners’ offices in both states responsible for identifying the dead and missing. It is a repeat role for the two statistical geneticists, who also served on a panel for the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in New York City after the World Trade Center attacks five years ago. Other NIH personnel serving on both advisory committees include: Leslie Biesecker, M.D., of NHGRI’s Genetic Disease Research Branch, and Stephen Sherry, Ph.D., and Lisa Forman, Ph.D., both of the National Library of Medicine’s National Center for Biotechnology Information.\n\n“Pulling together the infrastructure — from experts in various disciplines and from medical centers across the country — is a skill that forensics experts learned from 9/11. Most of us hoped it was a once-in-a-lifetime event, but sadly it was not,” said Dr. Bailey-Wilson, who is also an adjunct professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.\n\nMany medical and dental records normally used to match bodies with names of the missing were destroyed, leaving few clues behind as to whose remains were found. Even DNA-facilitated identification has proved to be a challenge. Personal items, such as toothbrushes and hairbrushes that could contain saliva and hair samples useful in DNA testing, were often contaminated or destroyed by flooding. Making matters worse, family members whose DNA is required to make a match were displaced by the hurricane, making contact difficult and adding delays to interviews and appointments for genetic testing.\n\n“One of the lessons learned from 9/11 was that talking to the families about the missing is skilled detective work, which is best done by qualified genetics clinicians and genetic counselors who know the right questions to ask based on the information needed to fill in the family pedigree,” said Dr. Pugh, who is also an assistant professor at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, observing that, in today’s world of blended families and multiple marriages, not all siblings are biologically related to one another.\n\nMost of the genetics professionals are being sent to the Louisiana Family Assistance Center in Baton Rouge, La., where investigative operations are based. Once there, they interview relatives by phone to help construct complex family trees of individuals who are presumed lost, a crucial first step in the identification of the dead using DNA testing.\n\nIn DNA identification testing, a person’s unique genetic makeup is matched against other previously known DNA samples, such as stored blood or material taken from toothbrushes or hair combs. If no known samples of DNA exist, DNA is obtained from family members in order to look for unique patterns of genetic traits, or markers, specific to the individual based on the patterns found in the family. In the case of the 2005 hurricane victims, ultimately, the state coroner makes an official identification using results from the DNA analysis alone or in combination with other information, such as distinguishing physical features or the location where the body was found.\n\nCompiling a genetic picture of the family requires an accurate construction of the family tree, which can be built using biological information obtained from siblings, parents, grandparents or cousins.\n\n“This is not an easy task. Taking down the correct information, correctly assessing the nature of relationships, and establishing which relatives are willing to donate DNA is a very sensitive and time-consuming process, especially for large, extended families. But it is a task that needs to be done so that families can finally get some answers about their missing loved ones,” said Barbara Biesecker, M.S., director of the Johns Hopkins/NHGRI Genetic Counseling Training Program, who has traveled to Louisiana with two groups of genetic counseling graduate students.\n\nTracking this process for each missing person and each recovered body involves tremendous attention to detail, added Dr. Pugh, who helped the Louisiana State Police Crime Laboratory’s DNA unit set up one of the computer systems and protocols that will guide the identification process. She notes that the whole identification effort follows strict confidentially rules to protect people’s privacy.\n\nA person’s DNA contains all the genetic information passed down from their parents, but slightly different — though mostly similar — combinations are passed along to siblings.

RELATED YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS White House George W. Bush Hurricane Katrina or or Create Your Own WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush has tapped homeland security adviser Frances Townsend to lead an internal inquiry into the administration\'s response to Hurricane Katrina, but leading Democrats renewed calls for an independent probe. Townsend, who leads the president\'s homeland security council, will follow up on Bush\'s promise two weeks ago to figure out what went wrong in sending federal help to the regions devastated by the August 29 hurricane, the White House said. She does not yet have a deadline or time frame for the inquiry, but she will be sitting down with Cabinet secretaries "in the next few days" to talk about how to move forward on completing it, White House spokesman Scott McClellan told CNN. He said White House Chief of Staff Andy Card told all Cabinet secretaries last week that Townsend would lead the internal investigation, and had asked them to "give participation in the inquiry the highest priority." Victims and public officials in the hurricane-stricken region accused federal agencies of botching the response to Katrina, which struck near the Mississippi-Louisiana state line. Nearly 1,000 deaths have been blamed on the Category 4 hurricane, which left much of New Orleans flooded and demolished beach towns along the Mississippi coast. While Bush administration allies tried to deflect blame toward state and local officials, the outcry prompted the reassignment and subsequent resignation of Michael Brown, Bush\'s Federal Emergency Management Agency director. Democrats have called for an independent inquiry into the response to the disaster, a step favored by 81 percent of those surveyed in a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll released Monday. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, said Townsend "may be a very competent individual. But how in the world can we get to the truth of the question as to what went wrong with Hurricane Katrina -- how can we really hope to discover the incompetence that led to all this human suffering and devastation -- if the administration is going to investigate itself?" But White House spokesman Trent Duffy promised the White House investigation will be "robust," and said there will also be a congressional probe -- although congressional leaders appeared unable to move forward with plans for an inquiry by House and Senate members Tuesday. Duffy called Townsend one of those "hardened and experienced government officials." "Her credentials are impeccable. She worked across party lines in the past and she is the perfect and natural point person for this exercise," he added. Durbin, the Senate minority whip, also questioned why deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove, Bush\'s top political adviser, is playing a significant role in reconstruction efforts. "Putting Karl Rove in charge makes no sense whatsoever," Durbin said. "He has no resume and no skills other than running political campaigns -- and if he is being put in place to protect the president politically, that decision does not serve the best interests of the American people, nor of the victims of Hurricane Katrina." But Duffy said Rove -- a controversial figure Bush has dubbed the architect of his presidential campaigns -- is "part of the policy apparatus of the White House." He said the president, not Rove, would be leading the administration\'s effort. "This is not about Karl Rove, it\'s about helping the victims of Katrina. That is what the administration is focused on," he said. "If others want to engage in the worst kind of politics, that\'s their business. We don\'t believe that contributes to the recovery effort." Townsend was tapped because she heads the president\'s homeland security council. Townsend was appointed to her position by President Bush in 2004 after serving as the deputy national security adviser for combating terrorism. Before arriving at the White House, she served in various intelligence positions at the Coast Guard and the Justice Department. She began her career as a federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, New York, in 1985.

Ahlers\n\nCNN Washington Bureau\n\nAn internal report says it was almost three days before FEMA realized the scope of the hurricane\'s destruction. RELATED YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Department of Homeland Security Disaster Relief Louisiana or or Create Your Own WASHINGTON (CNN) -- After being roundly criticized in a slew of media, congressional and government reports, the Federal Emergency Management Agency\'s internal watchdog Friday returned its own verdict on the handling of Hurricane Katrina: The criticism against FEMA is largely deserved. In a hefty 218-page report , the Department of Homeland Security\'s inspector general writes that the federal government and FEMA received "widespread criticism for a slow and ineffective response to Hurricane Katrina." "Much of the criticism is warranted," Inspector General Richard L. Skinner writes. The report gives an account of FEMA\'s recent history and response to Katrina, covering ground that has been well-plowed in recent months, although adding some details. It describes manpower problems, a decline in planning for natural disasters as attention focused on possible terrorist scenarios, and confusion over the roles and responsibilities of officials in responding to disasters. It culminates with 38 recommendations to FEMA\'s director and to the agency\'s parent organization, the Department of Homeland Security. Among the findings: Comprehending the disaster: With the communications infrastructure destroyed, it took FEMA officials about three days after landfall to grasp the magnitude of the hurricane\'s destruction. Meeting expectations: FEMA has long held that state and local governments should be prepared to survive 72 hours before federal intervention. But the report says, "It is unclear whether this is responsive to the needs of a state and the needs of disaster victims." The report continues: "What is clear is that a 72-hour response time does not meet public expectations, as was vividly demonstrated by media accounts within 24 hours after landfall." New response plans: The federal government was phasing in two "watershed planning documents" when Katrina struck -- the National Response Plan and National Incident Management System. Katrina exposed "severe deficiencies" in the response plan, such as the role of the principal federal officer, the person designated to coordinate the federal government\'s response. Then-FEMA Director Michael Brown was designated as such a person for Katrina. The role of emergency managers: The report questions the need for "emergency managers," one of 14 functions carried out by FEMA staff members during an emergency. Agency staffers who created the "emergency manager" function said it was "hastily designed, is incomplete and has not been fully implemented," the report says. Integrating federal and state command structures: The report says the federal government and the state of Louisiana, in particular, had "great difficulty" in meshing their command structures and "never fully achieved a unified command with FEMA." Emergency housing: The report cites numerous shortcomings with delivering housing. It notes that cruise ships contracted to provide shelter for emergency relief workers were 35 percent occupied during the first 30 days after the disaster. "At that occupancy rate, the cost to FEMA was approximately $3,363 per week per evacuee, which was about three times higher than the existing per diem rate for federal government workers in the area," the report says. Search and rescue: FEMA was ill-prepared to conduct the massive search-and-rescue function. Its federally coordinated teams conducting secondary building searches found spray-painted symbols indicating that state teams already had looked through the buildings. Ice, water and supplies: FEMA needs to improve the tracking of supplies. Some FEMA and state workers said they had to order twice as many supplies to get half of what they needed, primarily because they had no confidence in the system. Disaster drills: FEMA conducted large-scale natural disaster exercises between 1995 and 1998 but then opted for smaller ones with fewer participants. FEMA officials also said it became more difficult to maintain relationships with local officials when the job of awarding grants was transferred to another unit within the Department of Homeland Security.

But the hurricane picked a soft target – New Orleans has long been considered the US city at most risk from hurricanes.\n\nKatrina formed in the Atlantic and reached hurricane strength just a few hours before hitting the Florida coast on Thursday night between Hallandale and North Miami Beach. Heavy rains flooded the low-lying area, and the hurricane briefly weakened on Friday morning before regaining strength over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThere Katrina grew into a powerful giant – almost 500 miles wide – and turned north toward Louisiana. On Sunday, sustained winds peaked at 175 miles per hour (280 km/h), making it a Category 5 storm – the highest on the scale. Its central pressure dropped to 902 millibars, making it the fourth lowest pressure ever recorded in the Atlantic Basin.\n\nOnly three Category 5 hurricanes have been recorded hitting the US. One of them, Camille in 1969, made landfall only about 120 miles (200 km) east of New Orleans. But this time the Gulf Coast was lucky, and Katrina weakened after mid-afternoon on Sunday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe hurricane made landfall in Louisiana at 0610 local time (0710 EDT) as a Category 4 storm with sustained winds of about 140 mph (224 km/h). It swept north across New Orleans to hit the southern coast of the state of Mississippi. Katrina is the third Category 4 hurricane to hit land in 2005, in what is predicted to be one of the busiest hurricane seasons on record.\n\nCatalogue of concerns\n\nPreliminary reports cite flooding and collapsed buildings, but a full assessment of damage is impossible with the storm raging. A long catalogue of concerns must be addressed once Katrina passes over.\n\nAt the top of the list are the people who rode out the storm. Most of the 1.3 million residents of the New Orleans metropolitan area are thought to have obeyed evacuation orders. But nearly 100,000 people remained behind in the city – most of whom lacked any transportation. Some 9000 were packed into the Superdome, the most solid of the city’s 10 hurricane emergency shelters, which lost pieces of its roof.\n\nFlooding by a massive storm surge and heavy rains pose the biggest threat to the low-lying area. Levees line the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain north of the city, but behind these subsidence of delta sediments has left some parts of New Orleans up to 20 feet (6 metres) below sea level.\n\nEarly reports say the storm surge was not as large as expected – one model predicted 26 feet (8 m). Officials were concerned that it could top the levees and overwhelm the pumps that normally keep the city dry.\n\nWidespread flooding would be bad enough, but officials also worry it could be mixed with toxic materials from local oil refineries, urban sewage, and other detritus – even including bodies from local cemeteries.\n\nVulnerable marsh\n\nDepending on the extent of flooding and damage to pumps and levees, it could be weeks or months before people could return to their homes. Several months could be required if decontamination was needed, and if affected structures were damaged beyond repair.\n\nNew Orleans is a petroleum industry hub, and many offshore wells operate in the region. Katrina halted work on many rigs and refineries, but the fear of extensive damage remains. Oil prices surged above $70 per barrel in early Monday trading.\n\nThe southern Louisiana coast is marshy and not heavily populated, but has been suffering heavy erosion for many years as underlying muds subside, and tens of square kilometres of marsh are replaced by open ocean annually.\n\nKatrina’s wind-driven waves are also likely to carve away large chunks of the vulnerable marsh, and may obliterate some coastal towns.', 'title': 'Hurricane Katrina roars into Louisiana', 'url': 'https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7919-hurricane-katrina-roars-into-louisiana/', 'keywords': ['miles', 'katrina', 'orleans', 'louisiana', 'roars', 'storm', 'coast', 'north', 'hurricane', 'city', 'category'], 'tags': {'Earth', 'News'}, 'summary': 'Hurricane Katrina eased up just a little before hitting the Louisiana coast of the US on Monday morning.\nKatrina formed in the Atlantic and reached hurricane strength just a few hours before hitting the Florida coast on Thursday night between Hallandale and North Miami Beach.\nThere Katrina grew into a powerful giant – almost 500 miles wide – and turned north toward Louisiana.\nAdvertisementThe hurricane made landfall in Louisiana at 0610 local time (0710 EDT) as a Category 4 storm with sustained winds of about 140 mph (224 km/h).\nKatrina is the third Category 4 hurricane to hit land in 2005, in what is predicted to be one of the busiest hurricane seasons on record.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'Please enable cookies on your web browser in order to continue.\n\nThe new European data protection law requires us to inform you of the following before you use our website:\n\nWe use cookies and other technologies to customize your experience, perform analytics and deliver personalized advertising on our sites, apps and newsletters and across the Internet based on your interests.

Last year\'s storm caused an estimated $75 billion of damage to the Gulf Coast. And more than $4 billion was raised in charitable donations to help in the relief effort.\n\nThe question, of course, where did all that cash go? With us now is Trent Stamp, executive director of Charity Navigator. Four billion people donated [money to Katrina victims] in this country, is that unbelievable? Where did the bulk of it go?\n\nTRENT STAMP, CHARITY NAVIGATOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR: The bulk of it went to the Red Cross. And that\'s why they\'ve received so much scrutiny. You know, to whom much is given, much is expected. But the Red Cross, combined with the Salvation Army accounted for about two-thirds of all of the money.\n\nKASICH: And how did the Red Cross do?\n\nSTAMP: We\'re giving the Red Cross a "B." You know, they had some relatively well known failures, but you know, if you want to grade them...\n\nKASICH: So what\'d they do wrong?\n\nSTAMP: The debit cards too often ended up in the hands of people who didn\'t deserve the debit cards. I think the Red Cross didn\'t do a nice enough job in advance of Hurricane Katrina of having entre into the low income neighborhoods, the minority neighborhoods.\n\nSo when those neighborhoods got ravaged like they were they were unable to get in there and didn\'t know who to deal with. They were too isolationist. So, too often the cards got in the wrong hands and too often they didn\'t partner and play well with others.\n\nKASICH: Well, what does that mean? They didn\'t partner well?\n\nSTAMP: The Red Cross is historically relatively arrogant. They are the congressionally chartered first responder. And they like to believe they are the best and they are the brightest. And they are going to get it done. And in many cases a little humility would have done them a lot of good.\n\nKASICH: With the Bush-Clinton fundraising they raised a ton of money, didn\'t they? How much?\n\nSTAMP: They raised close to $200 million.\n\nKASICH: And what happened with that money?\n\nSTAMP: That was the problem. Is that they went around the country raising the money and they didn\'t really tell people what they were going to do with it. I had a problem then that you should never give to a charity that\'s vague or deceptive in what they\'re raising money for. It\'s like investing in a for-profit company without knowing what they are going to do with it.\n\nToday, just three weeks later — just three weeks ago, I\'m sorry, William Gray and Pastor T.D. Jakes from Texas and the Religious Advisory Committee has resigned from the Clinton-Bush Katrina relief fund because they are not even sure that the charities and churches they are giving to exist.\n\nKASICH: How can that be?\n\nSTAMP: I don\'t have any idea. I don\'t know why this isn\'t a bigger story. These people have phenomenal reputations. They are ex-presidents, obviously but I think they are making their charitable decisions based on politics as opposed to effective philanthropy.\n\nKASICH: What about a couple of the scams, the outright scams that we saw down there?\n\nSTAMP: It was amazing. The FBI predicts there are around 4,000 fraudulent Web sites that came about.\n\nKASICH: How can anybody have a — listen — the Lords of Leather Mardi Gras Krewe, it helped victims who were into S&M — it\'s unbelievable. Who were into S&M.\n\nI mean, this really existed?\n\nSTAMP: It didn\'t exist, John, and that\'s a key point.\n\nKASICH: It didn\'t?\n\nSTAMP: It did exist after the fact but it didn\'t exist the day before Katrina. And what happens is that anybody who applied to run a non-profit in the days after Katrina was fast tracked by the IRS. They were not vetted and they were sent straight to the front of the line bumping other good charities to the back of the line. And then who knows what\'s happened. Most of them have disappeared and you can only hope that some of the money got to who they said it was going to get to.\n\nKASICH: OK. So we know there was some rip off. You gave it a B, which means a lot of money got to where people wanted it to get to. But when you look at the surveys an overwhelming majority of people think the money just did not get anywhere. What does that mean for future giving? When you look at tsunami giving and on the back of that, Katrina giving, wow, I mean, people opened up their hearts and their wallets. Does this bode poorly for the future? What\'s your view?\n\nSTAMP: It does scare me. What is important to remember about the tsunami giving followed by the Katrina giving was that there was no fall off in 2006. Or 2005. But I worry moving forward with all the media attention, with all of the distrust, with all of the cynicism, people may start backing off.\n\nKASICH: Will we locked up the people that ripped off the system, are we going to go after them or let them get away with a little slap on the wrist? Because if you are stealing from people whose homes were washed away we have to go after you.\n\nSTAMP: There is a special place in Hell, John, for people who steal from charity, but I\'m not sure they\'re going to prison any time soon.\n\nKASICH: Are we going to go after some of them?\n\nSTAMP: I\'d like to but I don\'t make the laws.\n\nKASICH: Do you make the recommendation that we do?\n\nSTAMP: Absolutely.\n\nKASICH: Listen, if we don\'t go after people that have ripped this thing off and stolen from these kids and these defenseless people down there, we are making a huge mistake. — It will hurt charitable giving in the future. We have got to have some follow up on that.

We have two reports. First, Kim Lawton in Washington.\n\nPresident GEORGE BUSH: This recovery is going to be a long process. It’s going to take a lot of hard work and patience and resolve.\n\nKIM LAWTON: As the magnitude of the disaster began to emerge, faith-based groups across the spectrum sprang into action. The Salvation Army partnered with the Red Cross and federal emergency officials to coordinate initial efforts on the ground.\n\nCommissioner TODD BASSETT (National Commander, Salvation Army U.S.): We try to be the first in and the last out.\n\nLAWTON: Commissioner Todd Bassett headed to the Gulf Coast to assess the damage and encourage Salvation Army workers already there. Meanwhile, the Army has suffered its own damage.\n\nCommissioner BASSETT: Right this minute, we are not sure of some of our centers, but we do know that we have lost two of our program facilities completely, one in Biloxi, and that we have lost three of our officers’ quarters, and there has been damage to several other of our facilities.\n\nLAWTON: Hundreds of faith-based volunteers rushed into the devastated areas to help with rescue operations, while others mobilized to provide desperately needed food, medicine, and shelter. Southern Baptists initially committed to provide 300,000 meals a day for the next 90 days, but a spokesman expected that number to rise to more than one million. Congregations from almost every denomination opened their facilities and became emergency shelters.\n\nNational Protestant, Orthodox, Catholic, Jewish, and Muslim groups all set up emergency relief funds and issued special appeals to aid the victims. Many religious leaders also urged prayers for the victims.\n\nArchbishop THEODORE MCCARRICK (during service): What our brothers and sisters in Louisiana and Alabama and Mississippi are suffering today is our suffering, too.\n\nLAWTON: Local congregations far from the scene are organizing aid. The Archdiocese of Washington, D.C., for example, has asked its pastors and school principals to take in Catholic students evacuated from the hurricane areas.\n\nArchbishop MCCARRICK: We’re children of God, and God calls us to have this sense of family, that when someone in your family is sick or doesn’t have any water or has too much water or doesn’t have clothing, you have to reach out to help, and that’s really what moves and motivates our people.\n\nLAWTON: Despite all the efforts, relief officials acknowledge the situation is becoming more desperate.\n\nCommissioner BASSETT: This disaster that we’re facing right now has to be the most incredible disaster that has ever been faced in the United States. For us in the Salvation Army, we have never seen devastation this great, and the demand that is being placed on us in turn is one that is taxing us absolutely to our limit.\n\nLAWTON: They’re scrambling to meet the immediate needs before they can even begin to look at the monumental task of long-term recovery.\n\nI’m Kim Lawton reporting. Now, Fred de Sam Lazaro in Biloxi, Mississippi.\n\nFRED DE SAM LAZARO: It’s hard to find people anywhere in what was Biloxi’s main strip. Today, the carcasses of giant casinos that floated in the Gulf lie tilted on dry ground, lifted clear across the street.\n\nPeople instead spend their waking hours in very, very long lines — for gasoline, for water and ice, and, for those at the First Baptist Church, a hot meal.\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention, the nation’s third largest relief agency, was among the earliest to reach here, tapping its core of volunteers from across the Southeast.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED SOUTHERN BAPTIST CONVENTION VOLUNTEER (Praying): We pray, Father, that somehow through a warm meal, a listening ear, a thoughtful word we would give them the courage to go another day.\n\nDE SAM LAZARO: Each day here begins with a 6 a.m. devotional prayer. It ends 12 to 14 hours and 3,000 meals later.\n\nVERNON BOTELOR (Mississippi Baptist Conference): You know, this is a way we can minister to the people, by giving them a hot meal. I wish we could give them a cold drink of water, but we can’t get it. Now I understand that our president has said that we are going to send 400 trucks into this area. That’d be great, but we haven’t seen it. All we’ve seen is people in need.\n\nDE SAM LAZARO: Few local churches, many themselves victims of Katrina, could meet much of the overwhelming need. Still, there are small miracles. At the Main Street Missionary Baptist Church, people came in to give food as well as get it.\n\nDeacon ALPHONSE GRAVES (Main Street Missionary Baptist Church): Whatever they’ve got in their house, the canned goods — they’re bringing everything. And when they bring it to us we open it up, and we cook it for the rest of the people that’s walking in. Whoever comes in is welcome to whatever we’ve got.\n\nDE SAM LAZARO: The church’s sanctuary was demolished by the storm. But on the day Katrina hit, as the water rose, the upstairs community room became a different kind of sanctuary.\n\nDeacon GRAVES: We had a whole lot of elderly people in the church that we had to bring from the bottom stairs up to the top floor. So, you know, me and the rest of the pastors here, we hung in here throughout the water, watched it rise, and prayed with them and kept a lot of them calm. And we just become as a family in one unit.\n\nDE SAM LAZARO: With so many of the churches wiped out, Biloxi’s high school has become the main shelter in town, if not the only shelter. There’s a limited amount of food. There is water for everyone. But there is no electricity and all that that brings. And, most critical for a lot of people here, there’s no information.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: I’m looking for my daughter and grandchildren.\n\nDE SAM LAZARO: With phone service almost nonexistent, many survivors sought desperately to reach family members.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: They don’t know, so …\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: So I could see that my family and my girls — I have one in Virginia — and the rest of my family is in California, my mom and everybody.\n\nDE SAM LAZARO: Joseph Brooks was among the lucky ones. In the school parking lot, he managed to borrow a cell phone and, small miracle, get through to a sister in Missouri.\n\nJOSEPH BROOKS: She told me I ought to get down on my hands and knees wherever I’m at or was at and thank God that I’m still sitting here, talking and alive.\n\nDE SAM LAZARO: It’s a sentiment heard over and over again as survivors recount their narrow escapes — rescues from rooftops and attics.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: I’d be insane without the Holy Ghost. It’s the joy of God that keeps me going.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: That’s what’s gotten us through. You know, I mean, we literally, we’re hanging off that gutter for two and a half hours; we were all five of us praying, you know, saying, you know, “Please God, just give us our lives.”\n\nDeacon JAMES PRICE (Main Street Missionary Baptist Church): I believe it brought a whole lot of people closer to God. Some of them, you don’t see them at the church until a tragedy happens.\n\nDE SAM LAZARO: The scope of this tragedy will take some time to sink in and a lot more time to repair.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED SOUTHERN BAPTIST CONVENTION VOLUNTEER: Remember, we’re doing this for God. And a lot of people are pretty angry, perhaps, with God today. But they’re going to have a different view of God, because God cares.\n\nDE SAM LAZARO: The Southern Baptist Convention says it will remain here for as long as needed. Many more agencies will follow as relief work, at least in the months and years ahead, will replace casinos as the economic mainstay here.\n\nFor RELIGION & ETHICS NEWSWEEKLY, this is Fred de Sam Lazaro in Biloxi, Mississippi.', 'title': 'Hurricane Katrina Faith-Based Relief Efforts', 'url': 'http://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/2005/09/02/september-2-2005-hurricane-katrina-faith-based-relief-efforts/12722/', 'keywords': ['efforts', 'relief', 'katrina', 'god', 'know', 'lot', 'faithbased', 'baptist', 'family', 'hurricane', 'water', 'lazaro', 'sam'], 'tags': {'Baptist', 'Faith-based', 'Hurricane Katrina', 'Humanitarian', 'disaster relief', 'New Orleans', 'Mississippi', 'Louisiana'}, 'summary': 'In This Episode << SLIDE LEFT TO SEE ADDITIONAL SEGMENTS Hurricane Katrina Faith-Based Relief EffortsHurricane Katrina CommentaryHurricane Katrina Faith-Based Relief EffortsBOB ABERNETHY, anchor: As the Gulf Coast reels from the devastation of Hurricane Katrina and the federal government tries to speed up its much-criticized response to the crisis, especially in New Orleans, religious groups are playing a key role in emergency relief efforts.\nFRED DE SAM LAZARO: It’s hard to find people anywhere in what was Biloxi’s main strip.\nDE SAM LAZARO: Few local churches, many themselves victims of Katrina, could meet much of the overwhelming need.\nDE SAM LAZARO: It’s a sentiment heard over and over again as survivors recount their narrow escapes — rescues from rooftops and attics.\nFor RELIGION & ETHICS NEWSWEEKLY, this is Fred de Sam Lazaro in Biloxi, Mississippi.', 'date': 1125619200}, {'text': 'Tampa, FL (Sept. 7, 2005) -- Using two types of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) - one fixed wing and one helicopter - scientists from the Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue (CRASAR) at the University of South Florida worked with other Florida rescuers in hard-hit Mississippi immediately in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The first known use of small UAVs for an actual disaster, the UAVs demonstrated their usefulness as well as providing a wealth of scientific and engineering data.\n\nThe small fixed wing vehicle, looking much like a four-foot-long model airplane, provided video and thermal imagery from 100 to 1,000 feet, giving rescuers an overview of the disaster area. The vehicle is launched by manually throwing it into the air. It requires only a small clearing, about the length of five cars, to take off or land.\n\nCarrying a camera, the miniature, electric powered T-Rex helicopter from Like90 (http://www.like90.com) gave a hummingbird\'s eye view while hovering up to 250 feet high. It was also able to zoom its camera in to explore roof tops and look in windows.\n\n"The platforms, which require less than 10 minutes to set up and fly, were designed to be easily carried by responders as they hike into the debris," said Robin Murphy, CRASAR director. "The UAVs were provided in partnership with a National Science Foundation industry/university consortium that focuses on new safety, security and rescue technology."\n\nCRASAR has been focusing on developing and testing small UAVs since being called up by Florida Task Force 3 during Hurricane Charley in 2004.\n\n"We learned that seeing whether people were trapped on their roofs just beyond sight along a flooded road was critical," said Murphy. "It takes too long for manned helicopters to get there - if the radios are working."\n\nAt the request of the Louisiana State University Fire Emergency Training Institute (FETI), CRASAR was deployed Aug. 30 from Tampa to assist with rescue efforts just east of the French Quarter in New Orleans. However, because of destroyed or flooded freeways, and lack of secure surface roads, the team had to turn around just short of the city limits, said Murphy.\n\nIn response to reports of survivors stranded by flood waters, the team was then deployed by Florida responders working out of Stennis Space Center to survey nearby Pearlington, Miss. With progress into Pearlington blocked by complete houses that had been pushed by the storm surge into the middle of the main street, the team launched from an open patch of road surrounded by downed trees and power lines. Within two hours, the responders had the data form the UAVs showing that no survivors were trapped and that the flood waters from the cresting Pearl River were not posing an additional threat.\n\n"Katrina was so much worse than Charley," added Murphy.

But the video and transcripts show federal and local officials discussed threats clearly, reviewed long-made plans and understood Katrina would wreak devastation of historic proportions. "I\'m sure it will be the top 10 or 15 when all is said and done," National Hurricane Center\'s Max Mayfield warned the day Katrina lashed the Gulf Coast.\n\n"I don\'t buy the `fog of war\' defense," Brown told the AP in an interview Wednesday. "It was a fog of bureaucracy."\n\n-- Bush declared four days after the storm, "I don\'t think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees" that gushed deadly flood waters into New Orleans. He later clarified, saying officials believed, wrongly, after the storm passed that the levees had survived. But the transcripts and video show there was plenty of talk about that possibility even before the storm -- and Bush was worried too.\n\nWhite House deputy chief of staff Joe Hagin, Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco and Brown discussed fears of a levee breach the day the storm hit.\n\n"I talked to the president twice today, once in Crawford and then again on Air Force One," Brown said. "He\'s obviously watching the television a lot, and he had some questions about the Dome, he\'s asking questions about reports of breaches."\n\n-- Louisiana officials angrily blamed the federal government for not being prepared but the transcripts shows they were still praising FEMA as the storm roared toward the Gulf Coast and even two days afterward. "I think a lot of the planning FEMA has done with us the past year has really paid off," Col. Jeff Smith, Louisiana\'s emergency preparedness deputy director, said during the Aug. 28 briefing.\n\nIt wasn\'t long before Smith and other state officials sounded overwhelmed.\n\n"We appreciate everything that you all are doing for us, and all I would ask is that you realize that what\'s going on and the sense of urgency needs to be ratcheted up," Smith said Aug. 30.\n\nMississippi begged for more attention in that same briefing.\n\n"We know that there are tens or hundreds of thousands of people in Louisiana that need to be rescued, but we would just ask you, we desperately need to get our share of assets because we\'ll have people dying -- not because of water coming up, but because we can\'t get them medical treatment in our affected counties," said a Mississippi state official whose name was not mentioned on the tape.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nVideo footage of the Aug. 28 briefing, the final one before Katrina struck, showed an intense Brown voicing concerns from the government\'s disaster operation center and imploring colleagues to do whatever was necessary to help victims.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you\'re not a robot by clicking the box.

The Cochrane-Africatown Bridge on U.S. Highway 98 was closed for a damage assessment after a drilling platform drifted into the structure and wedged itself under the west end of the bridge, the state Transportation Department announced. The incident happened "sometime shortly after 11 a.m." the agency said. The bridge is used to bypass a tunnel under the river on Interstate 10 -- a road that was largely out of sight under the murky water that flowed into downtown Monday afternoon. Video of downtown showed floodwater had risen above the doors of the Gulf Coast Exploreum building. In an effort to discourage curious residents from checking out the hurricane damage, authorities Monday afternoon implemented a mandatory curfew for all of Mobile County. Mobile, which sits slightly inland on the Mobile River, was on the eastern side of the storm\'s eye wall, where the strongest wind and highest storm surge was forecast. (Full story) About a half block away from the Exploreum, the bottom floors of the CSX terminal -- which normally sits on the waterfront -- were inundated. Katrina also pounded Mobile with hurricane-strength gusts, shaking building walls and knocking down trees and power lines. According to the National Weather Service, a wind gust of 80 mph was reported at the Mobile Airport Monday morning. CNN affiliate WKRG recorded wind gusts of 72 mph, just under hurricane strength (74 mph). The powerful wind downed a massive billboard sign about a mile west of Interstate 65 along Mobile\'s Airport Boulevard, damaging a nearby business. A 20-foot storm surge was forecast as Katrina pushed inland. Rain driven by heavy wind pelted the 17-story Lafayette Plaza Hotel, forcing people inside to be moved to the west side of the building. "Water was pouring through the closed windows on the east side of the hotel because of the strong winds," CNN\'s Kathleen Koch said. Wind tore up an American flag on the front of hotel, and tossed around a metal vent cover on a two-story rooftop. Two hotel workers braved the weather in an attempt to secure the 6-foot by 4-foot piece of debris. A canvas-covered National Guard truck drove through the passable streets of Mobile, which were otherwise empty. Mobile County opened 11 shelters where some 2,700 people sought shelter. The shelters were at half capacity and officials said they were not sure if people heeded evacuation warnings or if they decided to ride out the storm. Authorities ordered a mandatory evacuation for 56,000 people living in low-lying and coastal areas of Mobile and Baldwin counties. Another 128,000 were urged to seek shelter elsewhere. Around 12:30 p.m. (1:30 p.m. ET), the Mobile County Emergency Management Agency ordered all county residents to stay indoors until Tuesday morning as a safety precaution. Most hurricane deaths occur in the aftermath of the storm, as a result of fallen trees and downed power lines. After Tuesday morning, a dusk-to-dawn curfew will be in effect for Mobile County until further notice. Only those who have an emergency or are required to go to work will be exempt from the curfew, which includes the cities of Mobile, Prichard, Chickasaw, Saraland, Satsuma, Mount Vernon, Creola, Citronelle, Bayou La Batre and Dauphin Island, as well as all unincorporated areas of Mobile County. The Alabama National Guard has activated a security force of about 450 personnel to Mobile and Baldwin Counties to help with traffic control as well as help secure the area, according to Gen. Mark Bowen. The state\'s National Guard has also activated two battalions -- a military police battalion of 285 and an engineer battalion of 500 -- to help neighboring Mississippi with its recovery. "During (Hurricane) Ivan we relied on them to come help us so it\'s our time for payback," Bowen said. "We\'re on standby and ready to go."

The scale is monumental. It\'s as if the entire Dust Bowl migration occurred in 14 days, or the dislocations caused by the Civil War took place on fast-forward.\n\nMany evacuees are putting down roots in new areas and say they\'ll never return. Others face months of a temporary existence before they can go home. Whatever they do, the nation may never be the same, as a smaller New Orleans rises up from its ruins, and bits of Creole culture are seeded from East coast to West.\n\n"This is the biggest resettlement in American history. A whole city has been uprooted," says Stephen Kleinberg, a sociology professor at Rice University in Houston.\n\nIf nothing else, the resettlement is already a story in state-to-state generosity. As of Sunday, there were an estimated 374,000 hurricane Katrina refugees in shelters, hotels, homes and other housing in 34 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Red Cross and state relief officials.\n\nThe total number of refugees may surpass 1 million, but a large percentage have been absorbed into their own relative\'s homes, say experts.\n\nIn many cases evacuees have ended up in places far from their native Gulf coast. A surprisingly large percentage of them say they like what they see.\n\nTake Arizona. Whether it\'s the clear weather in the Valley of the Sun, the helpful support, or being far from the reach of hurricanes, many of the hundreds of evacuees brought to Arizona intend to stay.\n\nVanessa Willis-Nelson beams as she strides out into the noonday sun from the State Fair Exhibit building. Inside, the Arizona Job Services department is holding a two-day job fair for Katrina refugees, many of whom are temporarily living in the adjacent Veterans Memorial Coliseum.\n\nMs. Willis-Nelson says a lot has happened in the past eight days to contribute to her sunny disposition. She has been offered a job at a local nursing home, and her husband has found work at a local warehouse. This week her family is scheduled to move into a subsidized apartment.\n\n"I ain\'t ever going back," she says. "Here we have three good meals a day, new clothes, and good medical treatment. You can\'t get that kind of help in New Orleans."\n\nBesides, the hurricane was the most frightening experience of her life, and she has no desire to ever repeat it. She says her New Orleans home flooded so fast that she was in water up to her neck on the second floor of her home before she knew it. A military helicopter plucked her, her husband, eight children, and two grandchildren from their rooftop. Then they were put on a plane - for the first time in their lives - and landed in Phoenix on Sept. 3.\n\n"We\'re going to start all over again here," she says. "Thank God for the change."\n\nTimothy Ambrose couldn\'t agree more. Dressed in a brown Speedo T-shirt, blue jeans, and new white Adidas sneakers, he seems overwhelmed by the help he\'s received in Arizona.\n\nTwo firms at the job fair offered Mr. Ambrose positions. In addition, Red Cross volunteers helped him locate his wife who ended up in Shreveport, La., while he landed in Phoenix.\n\n"I\'m here to stay," he says of Arizona. "I like the atmosphere, the beautiful, lovely people here."\n\nFrom the state of Arizona\'s point of view, its job fair has been highly successful. Of the approximately 120 evacuees who participated during the fair\'s first two days, 56 found immediate employment, says Santos Rodriguez, a spokesman for Arizona Job Services.\n\nMany evacuees will return to New Orleans, of course. But the city was already shrinking: from a peak of 630,000 in 1960, its population had declined to 445,000 this year.\n\n"For New Orleans, the big questions hinge around when it is rebuilt: How many people will it be rebuilt for, and who will they be?" says Alan Berube, a fellow in metropolitan policy at the Brookings Institution in Washington.\n\nTexas has long received the largest share of New Orleans\' outmigration, notes Mr. Berube. It\'s true for Katrina evacuees as well. The Lone Star State now has more than half of the shelter-based displaced population.\n\nAt Houston\'s Toyota Center this week, thousands of evacuees came to inquire about jobs, apartments, legal aid, and medical care. At a job fair people were getting help with their résumés, browsing bulletin boards, and slurping free ice cream.\n\nGaston Duronslet is standing in front of the bulletin board, scanning it for information technology postings. A single dad with three kids, he worked for DuPont in New Orleans before the storm.\n\nHis children are already enrolled in Texas schools. He\'s received an apartment rent-free for a month while he looks for a job. So far, he\'s been overwhelmed by Texan generosity; noticing his Louisiana license plates, one couple followed him until he stopped at a deli for dinner and paid for his meal. "I\'ve already written New Orleans off," says Mr. Duronslet, whose family has lived there since the mid-1800s.\n\nA big city like Houston is unlikely to be changed very much by an influx of Louisianans. Urban areas in the US are already largely populated by people transplanted from elsewhere. But the smaller the community that receives new residents, the larger the corresponding effect.\n\n"The impact in cities like Houston and Miami won\'t be very big," says Chris Girard, a professor in the department of sociology and anthropology at Florida International University. "But in rural communities and states that are more homogenous, there will be a much bigger impact and there will be some culture shock."\n\nBaton Rouge, for instance, has always been more staid than its neighbor New Orleans, 80 miles away. It\'s a "big small town," as one local resident puts it.\n\nBut it has suddenly become a big, big town, as thousands of evacuees have moved in.\n\nMany residents have embraced those in need, donating clothes, and volunteering at relief centers. But an undercurrent of suspicion may be arising in the wake of hurricane Katrina. One waiter told a visitor about a "hostage situation" in the city.

"Where there were tree lines protecting the levees, they were in much better shape.\n\n"It is fair to say that the Gulf Outlet played some role in making the situation worse."\n\nHigh cost\n\nAnother area where the loss of wetlands is being identified as a factor in making Katrina more destructive is Plaquemines Parish, the thin finger of land which protrudes into the Gulf of Mexico as the Mississippi completes its journey to the sea.\n\nIn some communities there is scarcely a building still standing, ravaged by the storm surge as Katrina passed across.\n\nWe lost in excess of 30 sq miles of our coast just during the 36 hours of Hurricane Katrina, and it will be very very difficult to restore that coastline\n\nCarlton Dufrechou\n\nLake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation\n\nIn addition, the silt dredged out from the river has been dumped in deep water on the edge of the continental shelf, instead of being allowed to replenish the wetlands.\n\n"We\'ve always said that the cost of not restoring this system was far greater than the cost of restoring it. These two hurricanes [Katrina and Rita] proved that we were absolutely correct," said Mr St Pe.\n\n\'More vulnerable\'\n\nWell before Hurricane Katrina, an ambitious $14bn programme was put forward to restore the Louisiana wetlands through a series of river diversions and other projects.\n\nOne of its chief proponents was Len Bahr, adviser to the Louisiana state governor.\n\nThe hurricanes dealt a severe blow to remaining wetlands\n\n"Now a lot of money will no doubt be spent. It is my great hope that it is spent not just to rebuild the city I love, but to invest significantly in the natural system which creates an apron of marshes, barrier islands and coastal forests, that provide tremendously efficient energy absorption from marine forces."\n\nNavigating an effective coastal restoration programme through the notoriously rocky waters of Louisiana politics and special interest groups will not be easy. And there is another problem.\n\nKatrina and Rita themselves dealt a severe blow to the remaining wetlands as the marsh grasses were smashed up and overwhelmed by the storm surges.\n\nCarlton Dufrechou of the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation said, "We lost in excess of 30 sq miles (78 sq km) of our coast just during the 36 hours of Hurricane Katrina, and it will be very very difficult to restore that coastline.\n\n"Each time we lose more coastline that makes New Orleans and the metropolitan area much more vulnerable to storm surges.

But many in the hurricane\'s path weren\'t so lucky.\n\n"The U.S. economy rebounded from Katrina, although the region hit by the storm has not, demonstrating once again how amazingly resilient our economy can be," said Dan Laufenberg, chief economist at Ameriprise Financial.\n\nThousands of people lost their jobs and were forced to move to other cities. Oil production and refining operations shut down for weeks. Gasoline prices soared, along with other energy prices. Close to 2.3 million people were left without power. The port of New Orleans was damaged, disrupting the nation\'s shipping industry.\n\nTo gauge how the economy responded to the most devastating U.S. natural disaster on record, the ABC News business unit contacted more than a dozen economists at various organizations, such as investment banks and trade groups, by e-mail and asked them to evaluate how the U.S. economy fared in the year after Hurricane Katrina made landfall.\n\nKatrina\'s Wrath\n\nThe 2005 hurricane season set new records as the busiest, with 28 named hurricanes and tropical storms, and most destructive, with more than $61 billion in insured losses. Hurricane Katrina caused the greatest amount of the misery.\n\nInsured losses from Katrina alone totaled more than $40 billion, according to the Insurance Information Institute. That was nearly double the amount of damage caused by the previous record holder, Hurricane Andrew, in 1992. Andrew left a wake of destruction in South Florida that totaled more than $21 billion in insured losses in today\'s dollars.\n\nHomes Destroyed, Abandoned\n\nMore than 200,000 homes, mostly in New Orleans and the surrounding area, were destroyed by the hurricane, far surpassing any previous disaster.\n\n"Hurricane Andrew and the San Francisco earthquake and fire, the worst previously, destroyed 25,000-30,000 homes each," said Michael Carliner, economist at the National Association of Home Builders.\n\nRebuilding the homes lost to Katrina has been a slow process.\n\n"Little new construction to replace destroyed homes has occurred over the past year in the areas directly affected," said Carliner. "It will be a decade or more before replacement building is completed, and the numbers of people and homes are unlikely to return to prehurricane levels."\n\nA study conducted by James Richardson, an economics professor at Louisiana State University, found that after Hurricane Katrina 11 percent of homes were destroyed or deemed uninhabitable in the New Orleans area alone. Throughout the state of Louisiana, nearly 18 percent of businesses were in a similar state.\n\nThousands of Jobs Lost\n\nWithout homes, thousands of people who left for other cities have not returned to places like New Orleans, and that means thousands of jobs have disappeared.\n\nIn his study, Richardson concluded that New Orleans lost 190,000 jobs and employment fell by more than 30 percent from August 2005 to December 2005. Statewide, Louisiana lost 214,000 jobs, or 12 percent of the state\'s total.\n\nIn the Biloxi-Gulfport area of Mississippi, employment dropped by 26,900 jobs -- a loss of more than 23 percent of jobs in the region.\n\nWithout jobs and with uninhabitable homes, many homeowners stopped paying their mortgages, and their loans quickly became delinquent.\n\n"The impacts of Hurricane Katrina on Louisiana and Mississippi caused the U.S. mortgage delinquency rate to rise significantly in the third quarter of last year," wrote Doug Duncan, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association. "The two states already had the highest delinquency rates in the nation prior to the storm."\n\nWhile many mortgage providers delayed collecting overdue payments, Duncan expected that many of the homes have been abandoned, and banks and mortgage providers will start to foreclose on homes this year.\n\nEnergy Crunch\n\nHurricane Katrina was particularly damaging to the nation\'s oil and natural gas industry, which is based mainly in the Gulf of Mexico. At the time the storm hit, the Gulf of Mexico represented approximately 29 percent of all domestic oil production and 47 percent of the nation\'s 17 million barrels a day refining capacity.\n\nOn Aug. 30 of last year, the day after the storm made landfall, 95 percent of oil production in the Gulf ceased. Oil companies hurried to restaff the platforms they had evacuated before the storm and make any needed repairs. But 10 months later, yearly oil production was still 30 percent less than pre-Katrina levels.\n\n"The hurricane had a short-term effect on the general U.S. economy only because of a temporary reduction of the supply of oil, natural gas and gasoline," explained William Niskanen, chairman of the CATO Institute.\n\nThe storm also shut down refineries throughout the region. Seven of the nine facilities that can refine up to 1.5 million barrels of crude oil a day were up and running by November 2005. Two refineries, however, took longer to restart.\n\nConocoPhillips\' refinery in Belle Chasse, La., which produces 247,000 barrels a day, returned to normal operations only in April of this year. Murphy Oil\'s Meraux, La., refinery started up with 80 percent of its refining capacity in May.\n\nThe short-term shutdown in refining capacity led to shortages of gasoline throughout the nation and spikes in gas prices at the pump. On Sept. 5, 2005, the average U.S. price for a gallon of gasoline set a new record at $3.07, according to the Energy Department.\n\n"The spike in energy prices due to the loss of refining capacity pulled money out of consumers pockets and slowed the economy slightly in the fourth quarter," said Dean Baker, economist and co-director at the Center for Economic and Policy Research. "These immediate effects had largely dissipated by the end of the year. If anything, the rebuilding from the storm (financed by insurance and government assistance) was giving a modest boost to the economy by the beginning of 2006."\n\nEconomy Suffers, Then Rebounds\n\nThe combination of higher prices at the pump, along with the loss of thousands of jobs, hurt the overall economy at the end of last year. Gross domestic product, or GDP, the measure of all goods and services produced in the country, dropped to 1.8 percent for the last three months of 2005 compared with a growth rate of 4.2 percent from the previous three months.\n\nMesirow Financial chief economist Diane Swonk wrote: "Katrina had real distortionary effects on the economy, shaving growth from the fourth quarter as both disruptions to business and the drag of higher energy costs played out, and then boosting growth in the first quarter as reconstruction got underway."\n\nAs gas prices dipped below $3 a gallon and the federal government began spending millions of dollars in reconstruction aid, along with spending by private enterprise, GDP rocketed upward at the start of the year to a very strong 5.6 percent growth for the first three months of 2006.\n\nPeter Kretzmer, senior economist at Bank of America, said, "Household spending recovered strongly in early 2006 as the oil and gas industries recovered rather quickly and energy costs receded."\n\nLingering Effects\n\nDespite the return of offshore oil production and refining operations in the Gulf region, the most significant legacy of Hurricane Katrina remains the volatile energy markets.\n\nReports of supply disruptions can send the price of oil and natural gas soaring. For example, when BP announced on Aug. 7 that it would shut down oil production in Alaska\'s Prudhoe Bay because of leaks and corrosion found in the pipelines, oil prices skyrocketed $2.22 to end the day at $76.98 a barrel, only 5 cents from the previous record.\n\nHigher prices for a barrel of oil translate into higher prices at the gas pump. Recently, gasoline prices have averaged close to 30 percent higher compared with last year.\n\nThe impact of Hurricane Katrina on oil production and refineries has made oil traders more skittish when it comes to hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n"The first Gulf hurricane [of this year] could create an excessive reaction in the energy markets," said economist Joel Naroff.\n\nBill Cheney, chief economist for John Hancock Financial Services, agreed: "The only really big long-term impact is on the psychology of the energy market. Katrina put the hurricane season front and center in every oil trader\'s consciousness, and I imagine that every named storm is going to cause increased ripples in oil futures compared with previous years."\n\nMark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\'s Economy.com, said, "The principal concern is if a hurricane affects the energy production in the Gulf. Another Katrina-like hurricane will send energy prices surging, which the national economy will have a difficult time digesting this go around."\n\nFor Many, Financial Pain Continues\n\nStandard & Poor\'s chief economist, David Wyss, pointed out that while energy continues to be a major issue for the economy as a whole, the region is susceptible to even more damage.\n\n"New Orleans itself remains very vulnerable, with the levees still unrepaired in large part, and the status questionable in view of the fundamental construction and engineering problems that were exposed," he said.\n\nIn addition, several economists noted that while the U.S. economy rebounded quickly from Hurricane Katrina, regional economies and many individuals continue to suffer.\n\nZandi summarized the storm this way: "A short-term event for the U.S. economy; a very painful long-term event for New Orleans and Gulfport, Miss., where the economies are still struggling."\n\n"The major long-term effects are the [continuing] displacement of close to 600,000 people and higher homeowner insurance rates for people living in areas vulnerable to hurricanes," said Dean Baker. "Of 1.5 million people displaced by the storm, more than 900,000 have moved back to the area. These people are employed in almost the same percentages as the population as a whole. However, 600,000 people still have not returned to the area.\n\nWhere the Economy Stands, One Year Later\n\nDespite the destruction, and the personal and financial impact to people in the path of the storm, the majority of economists surveyed by the ABC News Business Unit said the storm had a only short-term impact on the nation\'s economy.\n\n"It\'s amazing how large and resilient the economy is," said Bill Dunkelberg, economist for the National Federation of Independent Business.\n\nOne year later, the majority of economists contacted by ABC gave the U.S. economy a \'B+\' to \'A\' for its response to Hurricane Katrina.\n\n"New Orleans\' impact on the U.S. economy was limited to energy and port activities, and the rest was easily replaced," said Naroff. "And that may be the lesson. You can lose a city and not have any major impact on the economy over time. Many activities will be replaced in other parts of the country."\n\nBob Hartwig, chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute, gave the economy at \'B+\' saying, "I would have given it a higher grade were it not for persistently high energy prices."\n\nThat\'s one price everyone continues to pay since Katrina made landfall a year ago.', 'title': "Katrina's Economic Impact: One Year Later", 'url': 'https://abcnews.go.com/Business/HurricaneKatrina/story?id=2348619&page=1', 'keywords': ['katrina', 'orleans', 'prices', 'economy', 'storm', 'energy', 'economic', 'katrinas', 'impact', 'hurricane', 'later', 'oil', 'economist', 'homes'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': "But one year later, the nation's economy has absorbed the shock from the storm and returned to growth mode.\nGasoline prices soared, along with other energy prices.\nHurricane Katrina caused the greatest amount of the misery.\nThe impact of Hurricane Katrina on oil production and refineries has made oil traders more skittish when it comes to hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.\nOne year later, the majority of economists contacted by ABC gave the U.S. economy a 'B+' to 'A' for its response to Hurricane Katrina.", 'date': None}, {'text': 'Please enable cookies on your web browser in order to continue.\n\nThe new European data protection law requires us to inform you of the following before you use our website:\n\nWe use cookies and other technologies to customize your experience, perform analytics and deliver personalized advertising on our sites, apps and newsletters and across the Internet based on your interests.

He said deputies were not immediately able to check out the building because their vehicles were unable to reach the scene.\n\nPolice were already tracking down looters.\n\nNew Orleans\' historic French Quarter appeared to have escaped the catastrophic flooding that forecasters had predicted although some parishes were reportedly under six feet of water.\n\nOn Jackson Square, two massive oak trees outside the 278-year-old St. Louis Cathedral came out by the roots At the hotel Le Richelieu, 73-year-old Josephine Elow of New Orleans pressed her weight against the broken French doors of her room as a hotel employee tried to secure them.\n\n"It\'s not life-threatening," Elow said as rain water dripped from her face. "God\'s got our back."\n\nFor years, forecasters have warned of the nightmare scenario a big storm could bring to New Orleans, a bowl of a city that is up to 10 feet below sea level in spots and relies on a network of levees, canals and pumps to keep dry from the Mississippi River on one side, Lake Pontchartrain on the other.\n\nThe fear was that flooding could overrun the levees and turn New Orleans into a toxic lake filled with chemicals and petroleum from refineries, as well as waste from ruined septic systems.\n\nOfficials said a levee broke on one canal, but did not appear to cause major problems.\n\nBlanco took little comfort in the fact that the hurricane may have spared New Orleans much worse flooding, given the still uncertain toll in surrounding parishes.\n\n"I can\'t say that I feel that sense that we\'ve escaped the worst," she said. "I think we don\'t know what the worst is right now."\n\n"The pumps are still working up there but can\'t keep up with the water coming in," Rep. Charlie Melancon, D-La., told FOX News, noting that there has been extensive wind and water damage to the city.\n\n"It\'s going to be difficult … some people are already trying to get back onto the city and the hurricane-force winds have not subsided yet. We\'re trying to get the message out to them: \'Just stay away,\'" he said.\n\nNew Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin had ordered a mandatory evacuation over the weekend for the 480,000 residents of the vulnerable city; he estimated about 80 percent heeded the call.\n\nAbout 3,600 members of the Louisiana National Guard were assisting state police with the evacuation of New Orleans and helped establish 122 shelters across the state.\n\n"We\'re doing it all," said Louisiana Guard spokesman Lt. Col. Pete Snyder.\n\nSnyder predicted that the shelters in Louisiana will have enough water, cots and Meals Ready to Eat for those forced from their homes by the storm. Guard troops are providing security and screening for New Orleans residents seeking shelter at the Superdome. The Louisiana Guard was also standing by with helicopter support, if necessary.\n\nThe Army Corps of Engineers is anticipating requests to pump water out of New Orleans and has teams ready to move into impacted areas with necessary support like ice, water, temporary power, housing and roofing, and debris removal.\n\nDan Packer, CEO of Entergy New Orleans, Inc., which provides power for southeast Louisiana, said Katrina has inflicted the most extensive damage to that region\'s power grid in its history. Packer says 750,000 southeast Louisiana customers are without power and full restoration will take at least a month.\n\nNew Orleans has not taken a direct hit from a hurricane since Betsy in 1965, when an 8- to 10-foot storm surge submerged parts of the city in seven feet of water. Betsy, a Category 3 storm, was blamed for 74 deaths in Louisiana, Mississippi and Florida.\n\nKatrina hit the southern tip of Florida as a much weaker storm Thursday and was blamed for 11 deaths. The storm, the sixth hurricane to hit Florida in the past year, knocked out power to 1.45 million customers.\n\nA \'Devastating Hit\' in Mississippi, Alabama\n\nIn Alabama\'s Mobile Bay, Fred Wright\'s whole yard was flooded and muddy waves were hitting the back of his home. Wright, shirtless and wearing shorts, spoke of the high-dollar real estate on the waterfront: "There are lots of homes through here worth a million dollars. At least they were yesterday."\n\nBy midday, the brunt of the storm had moved beyond New Orleans to Mississippi\'s coast, home to the state\'s floating casinos, where Katrina washed sailboats onto a coastal four-lane highway. The Beau Rivage Hotel and Casino, one of the premier gambling spots in Biloxi, had water on the first floor, and the governor said other casinos were flooded as well.\n\nKatrina recorded a storm surge of at least 20 feet in some parts, where windows of a major hospital were blown out, utility poles dangled in the wind, and casinos were flooded. In some areas, authorities pulled stranded homeowners from roofs or rescued them from attics. In Alabama, exploding transformers lit up the early morning sky as power outages spread.\n\nKatrina was the most powerful storm to affect Mississippi since Hurricane Camille (search) came in as a Category 5 in 1969, killing 143 people along the Gulf Coast.\n\n"Let me tell you something folks. I\'ve been out there. It\'s complete devastation," said Gulfport, Miss., Fire Chief Pat Sullivan, who ventured into the hurricane to check threatened areas. "What you\'re looking at is Camille II."\n\nMississippi activated 853 National Guard troops to help with debris removal, security and logisitical support.\n\nGov. Haley Barbour said the most immediate concern now was search and rescue. He said unprecedented storm surges were hitting his state and many places along the coast were underwater. Some people were trapped in their homes and other buildings but rescue crews are unable to work until the winds die down. He also urged people not to return to their homes, as downed power lines and other perils still abound.\n\nBarbour also warned that looters who may take advantage of the situation will be treated "ruthlessly."\n\n"Looting will not be tolerated, period, and rules of engeagement will be as aggressive as the law allows," Barbour said during a press conference. "Security goes hand-in-hand with search and rescue."\n\nIn Alabama, Police Chief Arthur Bourne said the water was as high as it was during Hurricane Ivan (search) a year ago, meaning it could be days before homeowners get in to assess damage and begin cleaning up.\n\n"They need to just stay put. We\'ll let them know when they can get back in," Bourne said.\n\nCrude oil futures spiked to more than $70 a barrel in Singapore for the first time Monday as Katrina targeted an area crucial to the country\'s energy infrastructure, but the price had slipped back to $68.95 by midday in Europe. The storm already forced the shutdown of an estimated 1 million barrels of refining capacity.\n\nAdministration officials said Bush seemed likely to authorize a loan of some oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (search). But details remained in flux and no decision was imminent, they said.\n\nEnergy Secretary Samuel Bodman said in a statement that the SPR can be used in case of a natural disaster and that officials have been in contact with SPR site managers and oil refineries to prepare for any disruption in oil production.\n\n"Over the next few days, we will continue to gain more information on the specific needs and then be able to make a better determination on how we can help," Bodman said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'title': 'Katrina Hammers Gulf Coast', 'url': 'http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/08/29/katrina-hammers-gulf-coast.html', 'keywords': ['hammers', 'power', 'alabama', 'katrina', 'orleans', 'winds', 'louisiana', 'storm', 'coast', 'gulf', 'mississippi', 'hurricane', 'water'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Hurricane Katrina (search) pounded the Gulf Coast Monday with heavy winds and sheets of rain, slamming Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle.\nAs entire neighborhoods in New Orleans were submerged in water, Katrina sent boats hurling onto land in Mississippi and sent water pouring into the state\'s beachfront casinos.\nBush, urging prayer for Gulf Coast communities "hit hard" by Katrina, weighed whether to release oil from petroleum reserves to help refiners, administration officials said.\nMore than 5,000 National Guard troops were activated in four states to assist with recovery operations along the Gulf Coast.\nKatrina was the most powerful storm to affect Mississippi since Hurricane Camille (search) came in as a Category 5 in 1969, killing 143 people along the Gulf Coast.', 'date': 1125273600}, {'text': 'An Illinois woman mourns her two young daughters, swept to their deaths in Hurricane Katrina\'s floodwaters.

It\'s all a sham.\n\nTwo California men help stage Internet auctions designed to help Katrina relief organizations. Those, too, are bogus.\n\nMore than 18 months after Hurricane Katrina decimated the Gulf Coast, authorities are chipping away at a mountain of fraud cases that, by some estimates, involve thousands of people who bilked the federal government and charities out of hundreds of millions of dollars intended to aid storm victims.\n\nClick here for FOXNews.com\'s Natural Disaster center.\n\nThe full scope of Katrina fraud may never be known, but this much is clear: It stretches far beyond the Gulf Coast, like the hurricane evacuees themselves. So far, more than 600 people have been charged in federal cases in 22 states — from Florida to Oregon — and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe frauds range in value from a few thousand dollars to more than $700,000. Complaints are still pouring in and several thousand possible cases are in the pipeline — enough work to keep authorities busy for five to eight years, maybe more.\n\n"The reason we\'re seeing such widespread fraud is individuals were evacuated to all 50 states. Katrina was a national phenomenon," says David Dugas, U.S. attorney in Baton Rouge, La., and director of a command center that\'s part of a special Hurricane Katrina Fraud Task Force. "Everybody knew what was going on. Therefore, criminals knew what was going on."\n\nMajor disasters and fraud frequently go hand in hand. It happened after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Andrew\'s devastating sweep through Florida in 1992. People tried to cash in, falsely claiming to be victims.\n\nAfter Katrina, the same thing happened: Disaster aid was sent to inmates who applied from prison and to people who claimed property damage and provided addresses of vacant lots or cemeteries, among many abuses documented in Government Accountability Office reports.\n\n"We found several dozen schemes. There are probably a lot more out there," says Gregory Kutz, a GAO investigator who has testified about Katrina fraud six times on Capitol Hill. "The real clever ones cover their trail and disappear and they\'ll never be caught."\n\nGAO undercover investigators demonstrated how easy it was to cheat the system: Using phony names, Social Security numbers and addresses of damaged residences — such as the 13th floor of a two-story building — they still received several checks.\n\nWhile many people filed bogus claims, the growing roster of the accused goes beyond the usual con artists. It includes employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers, other public officials, business owners, even temporary workers for the Red Cross.\n\n"You can find criminals in every walk of life and that\'s what we\'re seeing here," Dugas says.\n\nThe GAO has referred more than 22,000 potential cases of fraud to the Katrina task force, though Dugas says the majority probably will not pan out. In a recent audit, the GAO also concluded FEMA had recovered less than 1 percent of some $1 billion investigators claim was fraudulent aid.\n\nFEMA believes the fraud total may be inflated but says it won\'t have an estimate until later this year. Kutz\'s response: "I don\'t think they know the magnitude of the problem."\n\nFEMA also says the relative scope of Katrina fraud isn\'t that unusual.\n\n"I don\'t think the numbers are proportionally too far away from what we normally experience in a disaster," says David Garratt, FEMA\'s acting recovery director. "It\'s extraordinary only in terms of the size of the population that was affected."\n\nA recent Associated Press analysis of government data obtained under the federal Freedom of Information Act suggested the government might not have been cautious enough as it doled out nearly $5.3 billion in aid to storm victims. The analysis found the government made more home grants than the number of homes in one of every five neighborhoods after Katrina.\n\nThe nature of Katrina fraud already has shifted as the Gulf Coast has begun reconstruction. Dugas says there now are more elaborate schemes with bigger losses.\n\nIn Mississippi, for instance, three people, including a Florida contractor, recently pleaded guilty to falsifying records of Katrina debris cleanup and billing the federal government $716,677 for the work.\n\nCharges also have been filed against organized rings in Florida, Texas and Oregon.\n\nThe Oregon case offers a textbook example: Ten people have pleaded guilty to applying for disaster checks. In their scheme, a few ringleaders recruited friends, neighbors and relatives, then split the proceeds. They collected about $324,000.\n\nNone had any connection to Katrina.\n\n"The folks who originally thought this up [discovered] ... this is kind of easy and said, \'Let\'s use some others to make applications,\' " says Lance Caldwell, an Oregon prosecutor who won punishments ranging from probation to several years in prison.\n\nDisasters create opportunities for people who are inclined to exploit others, says Dr. Lynne Tan, a psychiatrist at Montefiore Medical Center in New York who has counseled Sept. 11 survivors.\n\nAfter traumatic events "there\'s chaos and no one is accounting for the money that well [and] they see it as a time to come in for the kill," Tan says. "It\'s almost like leaving a house wide open. People come in and burglarize it."\n\nThe federal government isn\'t confronting this problem alone. The Louisiana attorney general\'s office has received more than 2,000 complaints related to contractor fraud and made dozens of arrests. Louisiana State police have made nearly 50 arrests for suspected insurance fraud. And the Red Cross has investigators ferreting out scams.\n\nThe Red Cross says 104 people have been charged with cheating the charity in hurricane-related fraud; 86 have been convicted so far, according to Devorah Goldburg, an agency spokeswoman.\n\nAbout three-quarters of those accused were temporary contract workers at a Red Cross call center in Bakersfield, Calif., she says. Hired to authorize cash payments to storm victims, they allegedly helped family and friends file phony claims.\n\nSome 2,500 other fraud cases representing about $5 million in losses have been referred to law enforcement as potential cases to prosecute, while nearly 21,000 allegations totaling another $34 million are being checked out, Goldburg says.\n\nSo far, the Red Cross has recovered $2.6 million in overpayments or fraudulently obtained funds, some of it returned in anonymous envelopes, Goldburg says. "People realize we\'re serious about investigating allegations," she adds. "They\'re seeing it. They\'re hearing it."\n\nBesides false claims, types of fraud include extortion, bank larceny, overbilling, public corruption, identity theft and using fictitious Social Security numbers or those of the deceased.\n\n"We expected all these things. We just know that criminals follow the money," says Alice Fisher, assistant U.S. attorney general and head of the fraud task force, which also is investigating scams connected to Hurricanes Rita and Wilma.\n\nAmong task force cases in the last several months:\n\n— In Illinois, Tina Marie Winston claimed she watched as her daughters, 5 and 6, drowned in the raging waters. She also said her New Orleans home had been swamped. Winston has no children and was living hundreds of miles away when Katrina struck. A judge acknowledged Winston\'s mental troubles but sentenced her to four years in prison for defrauding FEMA and others scams.\n\n— In California, two Romanian nationals were charged with helping stage bogus Internet auctions that duped victims into thinking their contributions — bids for items such as a motorcycle that was never awarded — would help Katrina relief groups. Losses exceeded $150,000. Leontin Salageanu pleaded guilty; Teodor Manolache is a fugitive.\n\n— In Louisiana, Jesse Pingno, former police chief of Independence, and Brian Lamarca, a former captain, await sentencing after pleading guilty to overbilling FEMA for overtime and vehicle use after Katrina.\n\n— In Alabama, Lawanda Williams was sentenced to 75 months in prison for using false Social Security numbers and different names to claim losses in Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana and Florida. Her Alabama home was not damaged. Authorities say she collected $277,377 and will have to pay restitution and forfeit items she bought including real estate, a mobile home, three cars and a 50-inch TV.\n\n—In Washington, D.C., Jeffrey Alan Rothschild was sentenced to 8 1/2 years in prison after pleading guilty to trying to acquire more than $100,000 in disaster aid, and admitting other financial crimes. Rothschild created false identities, obtaining some from a legal directory. He was able to get 38 FEMA checks, using mailboxes in Florida, Tennessee, New York and Virginia.\n\nAlthough some recent cases involve six-figure scams, many involved a few thousand dollars in emergency relief, prompting a watchdog group to question the focus of investigators.\n\nIn a report last fall, the Project on Government Oversight said most indictments, arrests and convictions involved people involved in "petty crimes" and claimed "so far the government has picked the low-hanging fruit from the tree."\n\n"It seems like they\'re picking on the small guy," says Scott Amey, the group\'s general counsel. "No doubt it\'s adding up. ... But I don\'t know if the system is going after contractors in a way to hold them accountable for the larger fraud."\n\nDugas says those kinds of cases — contracting and procurement fraud and public corruption — will surface in the years ahead, noting that much relief money has yet to be spent.\n\nAbout 150 to 250 complaints still come in each week, Dugas adds, and more than 9,600 possible fraud cases have been referred to investigators.\n\nRestitution is almost always ordered for those convicted, but "most of the money is gone for good," says Kutz, the GAO investigator. "It really is down the drain. I\'m not suggesting they shouldn\'t try to recoup it ... but the most important thing is to look forward and make sure they have a system in place they\'ve tested in advance."\n\nGarratt, the FEMA official, says changes already have been made. An instant verification system that was available online during Katrina has been expanded to include phone calls. FEMA says about 60 percent of Katrina disaster aid requests came by phone — and were a major source of bogus claims.\n\nHow effective will these improvements be?\n\n"I think they\'ll do better," GAO\'s Kutz says. "Whether it\'s enough to stem the full tide of fraud and abuse — I don\'t know yet. ... The proof will be when the next disaster hits."\n\nClick here for FOXNews.com\'s Natural Disaster center.', 'title': 'More Than 600 Accused of Hurricane Katrina Fraud', 'url': 'http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/04/02/more-than-600-accused-hurricane-katrina-fraud.html', 'keywords': ['disaster', 'katrina', 'cases', 'fema', 'fraud', 'far', 'aid', 'florida', 'accused', 'federal', 'hurricane', '600'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'The full scope of Katrina fraud may never be known, but this much is clear: It stretches far beyond the Gulf Coast, like the hurricane evacuees themselves.\nKatrina was a national phenomenon," says David Dugas, U.S. attorney in Baton Rouge, La., and director of a command center that\'s part of a special Hurricane Katrina Fraud Task Force.\nThere are probably a lot more out there," says Gregory Kutz, a GAO investigator who has testified about Katrina fraud six times on Capitol Hill.\nThe nature of Katrina fraud already has shifted as the Gulf Coast has begun reconstruction.\nFEMA says about 60 percent of Katrina disaster aid requests came by phone — and were a major source of bogus claims.', 'date': 1175472000}, {'text': '"The blatant fraud, the audacity of the schemes, the scale of the waste — it is just breathtaking," said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and chairwoman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\nSuch an outcome was feared soon after Congress passed the initial hurricane relief package, as officials at the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the American Red Cross acknowledged that their systems were overwhelmed and tried to create new ones on the fly.\n\n"We did, in fact, put into place never-before-used and untested processes," Donna M. Dannels, acting deputy director of recovery at FEMA, told a House panel this month. "Clearly, because they were untested, they were more subject to error and fraud."\n\nOfficials in Washington say they recognized that a certain amount of fraud or improper payments is inevitable in any major disaster, as the government\'s mission is to rapidly distribute emergency aid. They typically send out excessive payments that represent 1 percent to 3 percent of the relief distributed, money they then ask people to give back.\n\nWhat was not understood until now was just how large these numbers could become.\n\nThe estimate of up to $2 billion in fraud and waste represents nearly 11 percent of the $19 billion spent by FEMA on Hurricanes Katrina and Rita as of mid-June, or about 6 percent of total money that has been obligated.\n\n"This started off as a disaster-relief program, but it turned into a cash cow," said Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas, a former federal prosecutor and now chairman of a House panel investigating storm waste and fraud.\n\nThe waste ranged from excessive loads of ice to higher-than-necessary costs on the multibillion-dollar debris removal effort. Some examples are particularly stark.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe $7.9 million spent to renovate the former Fort McClellan Army base in Anniston, Ala., included fixing up a welcome center, clinic and gymnasium, scrubbing away mold and installing a protective fence between the site and a nearby firing range. But when the doors finally opened, only about 10 people showed up each night, leading FEMA to shut down the shelter within one month.\n\nThe mobile homes, costing $34,500 each, were supposed to provide temporary housing to hurricane victims. But after Louisiana officials balked at installing them inland, FEMA had no use for them. Nearly half, or about 10,000, of the $860 million worth of units now sit at an airfield in Arkansas, where FEMA is paying $250,000 a month to store them.\n\nThe most recent audit came from the Government Accountability Office, which this month estimated that perhaps as much as 21 percent of the $6.3 billion given directly to victims might have been improperly distributed.\n\n"There are tools that are available to get money quickly to individuals and to get disaster relief programs running quickly without seeing so much fraud and waste," said Gregory D. Kutz, managing director of the forensic audits unit at the G.A.O. "But it wasn\'t really something that FEMA put a high priority on. So it was easy to commit fraud without being detected."\n\nThe most disturbing cases, said David R. Dugas, the United States attorney in Louisiana, who is leading a storm antifraud task force for the Justice Department, are those involving government officials accused of orchestrating elaborate scams.\n\nPhoto\n\nOne Louisiana Department of Labor clerk, Wayne P. Lawless, has been charged with issuing about 80 fraudulent disaster unemployment benefit cards in exchange for bribes of up to $300 per application. Mr. Lawless, a state contract worker, announced to one man he helped apply for hurricane benefits that he wanted to "get something out of it," the affidavit said. His lawyer did not respond to several messages left at his office and home for comment.\n\n"The American people are the most generous in the world in responding to a disaster," Mr. Dugas said. "We won\'t tolerate people in a position of public trust taking advantage of the situation."\n\nTwo other men, Mitchell Kendrix of Memphis and Paul Nelson of Lisbon, Me., have pleaded guilty in connection with a scheme in Mississippi in which Mr. Kendrix, a representative for the Army Corps of Engineers, took $100 bribes in exchange for approving phantom loads of hurricane debris from Mr. Nelson.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn New Orleans, two FEMA officials, Andrew Rose and Loyd Holliman, both of Colorado, have pleaded guilty to taking $20,000 in bribes in exchange for inflating the count on the number of meals a contractor was serving disaster workers. And a councilman in St. Tammany Parish, La., Joseph Impastato, has also been charged with trying to extort $100,000 from a debris removal contractor. Mr. Impastato\'s lawyer, Karl J. Koch, said he was confident his client would be cleared.\n\nA program set up by the American Red Cross and financed by FEMA that provided free hotel rooms to Hurricane Katrina victims also resulted in extraordinary abuse and waste, investigators have found.\n\nFirst, because the Red Cross did not keep track of the hundreds of thousands of recipients — they were only required to provide a ZIP code from the hurricane zone to check in — FEMA frequently sent rental assistance checks to people getting free hotel rooms, the G.A.O. found.\n\nIn turn, some hotel managers or owners, like Daniel Yeh, of Sugar Land, exploited the lack of oversight, investigators have charged, and submitted bills for empty rooms or those occupied by paying guests or employees. Mr. Yeh submitted $232,000 in false claims, his arrest affidavit said. His lawyer, Robert Bennett, said that Mr. Yeh was mentally incompetent and that the charges should be dismissed.\n\nAnd Tina M. Winston of Belleville, Ill., was charged this month with claiming that her two daughters had died in the flooding in New Orleans. But prosecutors said that the children never existed and that Ms. Winston was living in Illinois at the time of the storm. The public defender representing Ms. Winston did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nCharities also were vulnerable to profiteers. In Burbank, Calif., a couple has been charged with collecting donations outside a store by posing as Red Cross workers. In Bakersfield, Calif., 75 workers at a Red Cross call center, their friends and relatives have been charged in a scheme to steal hundreds of thousands of dollars in relief.\n\nTo date, Mr. Dugas said, federal prosecutors have filed hurricane-related criminal charges against 335 individuals. That represents a record number of indictments from a single hurricane season, Justice Department officials said. Separately, Red Cross officials say they are investigating 7,100 cases of possible fraud.\n\nCongressional investigators, meanwhile, have referred another 7,000 cases of possible fraud to prosecutors, including more than 1,000 prison inmates who collected more than $12 million in federal aid, much of it in the form of rental assistance.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInvestigators also turned up one individual who had received 26 federal disaster relief payments totaling $139,000, using 13 Social Security numbers, all based on claims of damages for bogus addresses.\n\nThousands more people may be charged before the five-year statute of limitations on most of these crimes expires, investigators said.\n\nThere are bigger cases of government waste or fraud in United States history. The Treasury Department, for example, estimated in 2005 that Americans in a single year had improperly been granted perhaps $9 billion in unjustified claims under the Earned-Income Tax Credit. The Department of Health and Human Services in 2001 estimated that nearly $12 billion in Medicare benefit payments in the previous year had been based on improper or fraudulent complaints.\n\nAuditors examining spending in Iraq also have documented hundreds of millions in questionable spending or abuse. But Mr. Kutz of the accountability office said that in all of his investigative work, he had never encountered the range of abuses he has seen with Hurricane Katrina.\n\nR. David Paulison, the new FEMA director, said in an interview on Friday that much work had already been done to prevent such widespread fraud, including automated checks to confirm applicants\' identities.\n\n"We will be able to tell who you are, if you live where you said you do," Mr. Paulison said.\n\nBut Senator Collins said she had heard such promises before, including after Hurricane Frances in 2004 in which FEMA gave out millions of dollars in aid to Miami-Dade County residents, even though there was little damage.\n\nMr. Kutz said he too was not convinced that the agency was ready.\n\n"I still don\'t think they fully understand the depth of the problem," he said.', 'title': "'Breathtaking' Waste and Fraud in Hurricane Aid", 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/27/washington/27katrina.html', 'keywords': ['disaster', 'mr', 'fema', 'fraud', 'aid', 'breathtaking', 'cross', 'hurricane', 'red', 'officials', 'waste', 'charged'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': '"The American people are the most generous in the world in responding to a disaster," Mr. Dugas said.\nA program set up by the American Red Cross and financed by FEMA that provided free hotel rooms to Hurricane Katrina victims also resulted in extraordinary abuse and waste, investigators have found.\nIn Burbank, Calif., a couple has been charged with collecting donations outside a store by posing as Red Cross workers.\nSeparately, Red Cross officials say they are investigating 7,100 cases of possible fraud.\nThere are bigger cases of government waste or fraud in United States history.', 'date': 1151366400}, {'text': "The national trend surprised Cleveland K.

Charlie Melancon, whose district south of New Orleans was devastated by the hurricane, posted a sampling of e-mails written by Federal Emergency Management chief Michael Brown on his Web site on Wednesday.\n\nThe Democratic lawmaker cited several e-mails that he said show Brown\'s failures. In one, as employees looked for direction and support on the ravaged Gulf Coast, Brown offered to "tweak" the federal response.\n\nTwo days after Katrina hit, Marty Bahamonde, one of the only FEMA employees in New Orleans, wrote to Brown that "the situation is past critical" and listed problems including many people near death and food and water running out at the Superdome.\n\nBrown\'s entire response was: "Thanks for the update. Anything specific I need to do or tweak?" (Copies of e-mails posted by critic -- PDF)\n\nOn September 12 Brown resigned, 10 days after President Bush told him, "Brownie, you\'re doing a heck of a job."\n\nBrown is still on the federal payroll at his $148,000 annual salary. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, saying Brown\'s expertise was needed as he investigated what went wrong, agreed to a 30-day extension when Brown resigned. Chertoff renewed that extension in mid-October.\n\nBrown took over FEMA in 2003 with little experience in emergency management. He joined the agency in 2001 as legal counsel to his friend, then-FEMA director Joe Allbaugh, who was Bush\'s 2000 campaign manager. When Allbaugh left FEMA in 2003 Brown assumed the top job.\n\nBefore joining the Bush administration, Brown spent a decade as the stewards and judges commissioner of the International Arabian Horse Association.\n\nThe e-mails Melancon posted, a sampling of more than 1,000 provided to the House committee now assessing responses to Katrina by all levels of government, also show Brown making flippant remarks about his responsibilities. (Read how office e-mails can come back to haunt)\n\n"Can I quit now? Can I come home?" Brown wrote to Cindy Taylor, FEMA\'s deputy director of public affairs, the morning of the hurricane.\n\nA few days later, Brown wrote to an acquaintance, "I\'m trapped now, please rescue me."\n\n"In the midst of the overwhelming damage caused by the hurricane and enormous problems faced by FEMA, Mr. Brown found time to exchange e-mails about superfluous topics," including "problems finding a dog-sitter," Melancon said.\n\nMelancon said that on August 26, just days before Katrina made landfall, Brown e-mailed his press secretary, Sharon Worthy, about his attire, asking: "Tie or not for tonight? Button-down blue shirt?"\n\nA few days later, Worthy advised Brown: "Please roll up the sleeves of your shirt, all shirts. Even the president rolled his sleeves to just below the elbow. In this [crisis] and on TV you just need to look more hard-working."\n\nOn August 29, the day of the storm, Brown exchanged e-mails about his attire with Taylor, Melancon said. She told him, "You look fabulous," and Brown replied, "I got it at Nordstroms. ... Are you proud of me?"\n\nAn hour later, Brown added: "If you\'ll look at my lovely FEMA attire, you\'ll really vomit. I am a fashion god," according to the congressman.\n\nThe e-mails came from Chertoff, who oversees FEMA, following a request by Melancon and Rep. Tom Davis, R-Virginia, chairman of a House committee appointed to investigate what went wrong during Katrina, Melancon said.\n\nBrown resigned amid accusations that FEMA acted too slowly after Katrina hammered Louisiana and Mississippi, killing more than 1,200 people. He defended the government\'s response and blamed leaders in Louisiana for failing to act quickly as the hurricane approached.\n\nHe acknowledged he made some mistakes as FEMA\'s director, but he stressed that the agency "is not a first responder," insisting that role belonged to state and local officials.\n\nBrown could not be reached for comment Wednesday night on the e-mails and Melancon\'s charges.\n\nAlthough Chertoff has not turned over all the documents requested by the committee, Melancon charged that the material received so far contradicts testimony by Brown before the committee in which he described himself as an effective leader. (Melancon\'s analysis of e-mails -- PDF)\n\nMelancon used an e-mail sent September 2, four days after the hurricane hit, to illustrate his point. On that day, Brown received a message with the subject "medical help." At the time, thousands of patients were being transported to the New Orleans airport, which had been converted to a makeshift hospital. Because of a lack of ventilators, medical personnel had to ventilate patients by hand for as long as 35 hours, according to Melancon.\n\nThe text of the e-mail reads: "Mike, Mickey and other medical equipment people have a 42-foot trailer full of beds, wheelchairs, oxygen concentrators, etc. They are wanting to take them where they can be used but need direction.\n\n"Mickey specializes in ventilator patients so can be very helpful with acute care patients. If you could have someone contact him and let him know if he can be of service, he would appreciate it. Know you are busy but they really want to help."\n\nMelancon said Brown didn\'t respond for four days, when he forwarded the original e-mail to FEMA Deputy Chief of Staff Brooks Altshuler and Deputy Director of Response Michael Lowder.\n\nThe text of Brown\'s e-mail to them read: "Can we use these people?"\n\nMelancon also charged that few of the e-mails from Brown show him assigning specific tasks to employees or responding to pressing problems.\n\nOn September 1, FEMA officials exchanged e-mails reporting severe shortages of ice and water in Mississippi. They were to receive 60 trucks of ice and 26 trucks of water the next day, even though they needed 450 trucks of each.\n\nRobert Fenton, a FEMA regional response official, predicted "serious riots" if insufficient supplies arrive.\n\nBrown was forwarded the series of e-mails about the problem, but no response from him is shown in the e-mails provided to the committee, Melancon said.\n\nKatrina came ashore along the Louisiana-Mississippi state line, after being downgraded from a Category 5 to a Category 4 storm. It flooded 80 percent of New Orleans. It was followed about a month later by Hurricane Rita, which caused more damage and flooding.\n\nMelancon and several other Democrats from districts directly affected by Katrina were invited to participate as a ex-officio members of the Katrina investigative committee, though they have no formal role.

(See video of Bush\'s speech -- 9:23)\n\n"This recovery will take years," Bush said in an address from the White House Rose Garden, hours after viewing parts of the Gulf Coast from aboard Air Force One. (Bush: \'Devastating sights\')\n\nThe Bush administration earlier in the day declared a public health emergency for the entire Gulf Coast in an effort to stop the spread of disease in the storm\'s wake. (Health risks)\n\n"We are gravely concerned about the potential for cholera, typhoid and dehydrating diseases," Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt said. (See video on health concerns -- 2:18)\n\nMeanwhile, New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin reportedly said Wednesday that the storm probably killed thousands of people in his battered and flood-stricken city.\n\n"We know there is a significant number of dead bodies in the water," and others dead in attics, The Associated Press quoted Nagin as saying. When asked how many, he reportedly said: "Minimum, hundreds. Most likely, thousands."\n\nNagin and other Louisiana officials had refused to give a casualty count in the past, saying emergency workers were focusing on the rescue effort.\n\nRescue workers continued to push bodies aside Wednesday as they used boats and helicopters to search for survivors. Their efforts have been hampered by lawlessness and damaged infrastructure.\n\nElectricity was out for more than 2.3 million people in Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama and Florida.\n\nMeanwhile, Katrina\'s effect on oil supplies and gas prices spread nationwide, prompting the White House to tap the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n\nNews of disruptions in the gas supply sparked runs on stations and a sharp spike in prices, with some drivers in Atlanta, Georgia, facing prices above $5 per gallon. (Economic impact)\n\nPentagon officials said Wednesday the governors of Louisiana and Mississippi have ordered the mobilization of an additional 10,000 National Guard troops to provide security and help with hurricane relief. (See video on Pentagon response -- 2:14)\n\nFederal officials asked for patience as residents of the affected areas expressing frustration with the government\'s response.\n\n"I need the American people to recognize how catastrophic this is, to be patient and to work with us," said Michael Brown, the Federal Emergency Management Agency chief who is leading the federal response on the ground.\n\nSwapping domes\n\nThe first evacuation buses departed Wednesday evening near the Louisiana Superdome, where up to 30,000 people sought shelter. Weary storm survivors stood in mobs waiting to board buses under the direction of National Guard troops. (Full story)\n\nThe Superdome had little power, no air conditioning, the toilets were backed up and both food and water were in short supply.\n\nThe first buses arrived early Thursday in Houston, Texas, where the displaced residents will be housed at the Astrodome stadium.\n\nResidents were warned to expect a prolonged displacement.\n\n"I surmise there are people in New Orleans who won\'t be able to get back to their homes for months, if ever," Brown said.\n\nSome desperate people tried to walk away from the stadium on their own. Widespread looting of businesses continued, punctuated by the sounds of gunfire. (Harrowing tales)\n\nWednesday evening, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers planned to use helicopters to begin dropping 15,000-pound sandbags into breaches in the city\'s levee system -- the first step in trying to control the flooding that submerged most of the city. (See video on levee repairs -- 3:53)\n\nThe flow of water into New Orleans from Lake Pontchartrain finally abated, and the lake level began dropping gradually, Corps officials said. But engineers won\'t begin trying to pump out the water until the breaches are plugged. (Recovery efforts)\n\nAt least seven hospitals in the city were evacuating patients and personnel because of flooding and a frightening breakdown in public order.\n\nDoctors said two patients died Wednesday at Charity Hospital as a result of the lack of electricity and water.\n\nThe head of Acadian Ambulance Service, Richard Zuschlag, said his workers had been victimized by the mayhem sweeping the city as they worked to evacuate hospitals.

Kathleen Blanco said she was "just furious" about the lawlessness.\n\n"We\'ll do what it takes to bring law and order to our region," she said at a news conference.\n\nNagin ordered most of the city\'s police to halt their rescue efforts and concentrate instead on stopping looters who have grown more aggressive, the AP reported.\n\nSome of the looting was taking place in front of police, with little response. Along Canal Street, the city\'s main thoroughfare, police allowed people to take shoes out of stores as long as the shoes fit.\n\nMeanwhile, firefighters labored to fight a blaze in a store at the edge of the city\'s famed French Quarter. Firefighters had to pump floodwater from the street because hydrants didn\'t work.\n\nLaw enforcement officials expressed frustration with their inability to communicate.\n\n"The communication systems throughout the entire Gulf Coast are severely compromised," said Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu.\n\nEmergency crews continued to rescue people trapped in their homes as floodwaters rose.\n\nAbout 400 residents from a neighborhood near Lake Pontchartrain, many of them injured or elderly people in need of medical attention, were taken to a dry location in suburban Jefferson Parish, Fire Capt. Al Martineaux said.\n\n"All we could do was just go down the streets listening to people yelling, and when we found them, open up their roofs and get them out," he said.\n\nAcross Lake Pontchartrain, in Slidell, Louisiana, Mayor Ben Morris was among thousands of homeless residents who have been unable to communicate with anyone outside Slidell.\n\nMorris estimated 90 percent of the city\'s residences were destroyed or damaged and that half of its 30,000 residents will be left homeless.\n\nMississippi seeks help\n\nIn Mississippi on Wednesday, an emergency official told CNN that as many as 110 people were killed in the storm, and that toll was expected to climb.\n\nHarrison County Coroner Gary Hargrove said crews had been unable to reach half of the community. (See video of corpse recoveries -- 3:05)\n\n"It may take several days and maybe even weeks to get to because we\'re talking about major buildings ... collapsing and just what we call \'pancaking,\' " he told reporters at a news conference.\n\nHargrove also discounted reports from Tuesday that 30 people had been killed in one beachfront apartment complex, saying it wasn\'t true.\n\nCoroners across the state have so far confirmed only 13 dead, according to the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency.\n\nThose who left their homes should stay away, said the agency\'s public information officer, Brad Mayo.\n\n"We cannot stress enough not to go back," he said.

A man in Fort Lauderdale was killed when a large ficus tree fell onto his car on a street near downtown, bringing power lines down with it, police spokesman Bill Schultz said. Another man in Plantation died when he was hit by a tree after going outside to inspect damage from a branch that fell on his mobile home, Plantation Police Sgt. Al Butler said. A third man died in Cooper City when the car he was driving struck a tree as he was attempting to avoid a downed tree on a road, said Broward County Sheriff\'s Office spokesman Hugh Graf. An overpass under construction over Florida Highway 836 west of Miami also collapsed during the storm. There were no immediate reports of injuries, according to Miami-Dade Metro Police. At 11 p.m. ET, despite being over land for more than four hours, Katrina\'s maximum sustained winds were still being clocked at 75 mph, just 5 mph weaker than when the storm came ashore between Hallandale Beach and North Miami Beach at 6:30 p.m. Instead of going across the Florida peninsula as projected, Katrina took a slight jog to the southwest after making landfall, pushing the brunt of the storm into Miami-Dade County. At 11 p.m., the center of the hurricane was 35 miles southwest of Miami and 20 miles northwest of Homestead. Thursday night, Florida Power and Light reported that 525,000 customers in Miami-Dade County were without power, along with 477,000 in Broward County and 76,000 in Palm Beach County. "We\'re well over a million, and it doesn\'t look like it\'s going to ease up," said utility spokesman Bill Swank. The company was bringing in more than 4,100 electrical workers from other areas to help restore power. The storm was classified as a minimal, Category 1 hurricane, making serious wind damage unlikely. However, flooding was a major concern from the slow-moving storm. (Intensity scale) Radar showed Katrina, which was moving at a mere 6 mph, was dumping 1 to 2 inches of rain an hour. Six to 10 inches of rain were likely along its path, with up to 15 inches possible in some isolated areas, forecasters said. \'Take this seriously\' Throughout Thursday, officials warned the more than 5 million people living in southeast Florida not be be lulled into a false sense of security by the storm\'s relatively modest winds. At a news conference, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, whose state was battered by four powerful hurricanes last year, made the point that any hurricane is dangerous, regardless of its category. "Hurricanes are hurricanes, and they bring with them the possibility of really severe flooding and wind damage, so it\'s important to take this seriously," Bush said. People were being told to take cover in their homes. Residents of low-lying areas, barrier islands and those living in mobile homes were urged to evacuate, though evacuations remained mostly voluntarily. The only mandatory evacuation was for barrier islands and low-lying areas in southern Palm Beach County, around Boca Raton. Interstate 95, the main north-south freeway along the east coast, was jammed with traffic Thursday afternoon, as people left work early to get home before the storm hit. In Hollywood, Alberto Soddu was buying plywood to cover some of his windows that aren\'t protected by shutters. "After the [Hurricane] Andrew experience, I am taking it seriously," he told CNN. Hurricane Andrew, Category 5 storm, slammed into south Florida on August 24, 1992, causing $30 billion in damage. Forty deaths were attributed to the storm. Travel disrupted Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport shut down Thursday evening. While airports in West Palm Beach and Miami did not officially close, airlines serving both cities began canceling most of their flights. Ports in the area also closed. A hurricane warning -- meaning winds of at least 74 mph were expected within 24 hours -- was in effect from Jupiter Inlet south to Florida City, including Lake Okeechobee to the west. The storm was relatively small. The eye was only 10 miles across, and hurricane force winds extended only 15 miles from the center. The long-term forecast track from the hurricane center showed Katrina weakening and crossing the Florida peninsula Friday, then moving out over the Gulf of Mexico and sweeping north toward the hurricane-weary northern Gulf Coast. The storm could make a second landfall late Sunday or early Monday. "We\'re becoming very concerned that as it moves in the gulf, even though it will weaken over the peninsula, it will have a very good chance to restrengthen into a hurricane over the Gulf of Mexico," said Max Mayfield, director of the hurricane center. The stretch of Gulf Coast from Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle already has been hit with three tropical systems this year -- Hurricane Dennis and tropical storms Arlene and Cindy. Because of the erratic nature of hurricane movement, long-range forecasts often change. Thursday evening, a tropical storm warning was issued for the west coast of the Florida peninsula from Longboat Key near Bradenton south to Florida Bay; for the Florida Keys; and for the east coast from Florida City southward to Florida Bay and from Jupiter Inlet north to Vero Beach. The warning means tropical storm conditions, including sustained winds of at least 39 mph, were expected in the next 24 hours. Katrina is the 11th named storm of the busy 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, with more than three months to go. By contrast, over the past 60 years the average number of named storms in an entire season was just 10, according to the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration. The large number of early storms prompted forecasters to update their estimates of hurricane activity this year, projecting that as many as 21 named storms might develop. Historically, the busiest months for tropical activity are September, August and October -- in that order. CNN\'s Jason Carroll, Jacqui Jeras, Rob Marciano and Ed Zarrella contributed to this report.

"I can\'t tell you what he was thinking of in terms of programs. It was a reasonable guess at that time."\n\nNeither the Congressional Budget Office nor the Office of Management and Budget will comment on those estimates, nor have they issued any of their own.\n\n"It didn\'t come from us. We\'re in the process of determining (an estimate) right now," says Alex Conant, a spokesman for OMB.\n\nCongress has appropriated $62 billion for Katrina relief, "but only $13 billion has been used so far," Conant added. Most of that money has been given to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, with few strings attached.\n\nPerhaps emboldened by Gregg\'s estimate, Louisiana\'s two U.S. senators on Thursday introduced the Hurricane Katrina Disaster Relief and Economic Recovery Act, seeking $250 billion in long-term assistance for the Gulf Coast region.\n\nThe bill included $40 billion for Army Corps of Engineer projects, "about 10 times the annual Corps budget for the entire nation, or 16 times the amount the Corps has said it would need to protect New Orleans from a Category 5 hurricane," the Washington Post reported Monday.\n\nThe bill included a staggering array of requests, including $400 million for mental health and substance abuse services for Katrina victims, $600 million to rebuild early childhood programs, $25.5 million for sugar cane research, $11 million to replace lost cattle and $10 million for fisheries.\n\nAppropriately, the wish list includes a provision to cover lost Christmas trees.\n\nOn Monday, Bill Hoagland, a senior adviser to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., questioned the consensus estimate. "I don\'t think it was based on any concrete analysis. It may be correct, but it has an equal likelihood of being closer to $100 billion than $200 billion," he said.\n\nHoagland added up some numbers. The statutory cap on federal supplemental disaster assistance is $26,200 per household. "If 1.1 million households were affected, that\'s around $30 billion," he said.\n\n"The working assumption, and I think it\'s overstated, is that there are 400,000 who have lost their jobs and qualify for unemployment assistance. The average (unemployment benefit) is $250 per week. If they all qualify for six months, that\'s $2.5 billion," he added. Food stamps add another $2.5 billion.\n\nHe used the U.S. Department of Agriculture\'s estimate of farm-related losses: $1 billion.\n\nHe added in $30 billion for flood insurance claims, the upper end of the Bush administration\'s estimate, plus $2 billion in federal tax incentives.\n\nThese items add up to almost $70 billion.\n\nThe two big numbers he left out were damage to federal property such as weather and military stations, and damage to public infrastructure. When the president declares a disaster area, the federal government picks up 75 to 100 percent of the tab for rebuilding public infrastructure such as roads and bridges.\n\nAlthough these two are hard to estimate, Hoagland does not think they will bring the total cost to $200 billion.\n\n"It may at the end of the day cost that much, but there is no basis for those numbers just now," he said.\n\nTo cross check his numbers, Hoagland looked to Risk Management Solutions, a Newark firm that uses scientific and financial models to estimate disaster costs.

RELATED SPECIAL REPORT \x95 Rebuilding: Vital signs \x95 Gallery: Landmarks over time \x95 Storm & Flood: Making history \x95 I-Report: Share your photos Special Report YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) New Orleans (Louisiana) Disasters (General) Michael Chertoff or or Create Your Own WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff took responsibility at a Senate hearing Wednesday for his department\'s inadequate response to Hurricane Katrina, which "unnecessarily prolonged" the suffering of people along the Gulf Coast. But Chertoff flatly rejected the accusation that either DHS or the White House were disengaged as the storm deluged New Orleans and leveled much of coastal Mississippi. "The idea that this department and this administration and the president were somehow detached from Katrina is simply not correct," he said. "We were acutely aware of Katrina and the risk it posed." Chertoff was testifying before the committee the same day a House report was to be released accusing him of missteps in his response to the storm, which claimed 1,322 lives. The report, written by a committee of Republicans, takes Chertoff to task for waiting until two days after the storm hit to activate a national response plan and for appointing Michael Brown, then-director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to lead the federal response effort despite Brown not being trained to take on that role. (Full story) "If I knew then what I know now about Mr. Brown\'s agenda, I would have done something different," Chertoff said. Brown quit his post following widespread criticism after the storm, later blaming Chertoff and others of dragging their feet and ignoring his warnings about massive flooding. Chertoff disputed Brown\'s claim that Chertoff knew Monday night, after Katrina hit, about New Orleans\' levees being breached. "When I went to bed, it was my belief -- and it was somewhat fortified by things I saw on TV -- that, actually, the storm had not done the worst that had been imagined," Chertoff said. He added that in a status briefing Monday evening he heard reports of breaches but was told "nothing has been confirmed." Chertoff also said that the weekend before Katrina hit, President Bush declared a state of emergency in Louisiana and Mississippi, a step that only once had been taken before a hurricane\'s landfall. He said that declaration authorized a full federal response, and he had been assured by Brown and officials dealing with the emergency on the ground that they had what they needed to respond. But the secretary also told members of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which has been investigating the government\'s response to the hurricane, that "you can\'t escape the fact, when you talk about Katrina, that this was a storm of unprecedented magnitude." "Not because it was a surprise, because I don\'t think it was a surprise that a storm like this could happen. But because in terms of prior experience, at least as far as I know, nobody in living memory recalls a set of challenges as difficult as those presented by this hurricane," he said, noting that Katrina affected a geographic area larger than Britain. The committee\'s Republican chairwoman, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, told Chertoff that the Department of Homeland Security\'s "alarming and unacceptable" response to Katrina raised serious questions about how well it could deal with a terrorist attack. "If our government failed so utterly in preparing for, and responding to, a disaster that had been long predicted and was imminent for days, we must wonder how much more profound the failure would be if a disaster were to take us by complete surprise," she said. Chertoff, who took over as DHS secretary a year ago, said that a month before the storm made landfall August 29, he had warned publicly that "we were not where we needed to be in terms of preparedness." He said he planned to launch a program to improve the department\'s capabilities on October 1, when money became available at the start of the new fiscal year. "Unfortunately, Katrina didn\'t wait until October 1," he said. Chertoff also said that in a video teleconference August 28, the day before the storm hit, he was assured by emergency management and National Guard officials from the states affected by the storm, as well as experts from FEMA, that the resources needed to deal with Katrina were either in place or on the way. Chertoff said he specifically asked Brown if there was anything else he needed from DHS, telling him all the resources of the department were at his disposal. He said Brown responded that "everybody has been through this drill before. We are all engaged and working." But Chertoff "certainly had reservations," which prompted him to accompany Bush on a September 1 trip to the Gulf Coast to make his own assessments, he said. It was during that trip that Bush said, "Brownie, you\'re doing a heck of a job." Chertoff removed Brown as head of the relief effort the next day. Brown resigned as FEMA chief two weeks later. Before beginning his testimony, Chertoff sat expressionless as Collins bluntly critiqued his department\'s response to Katrina, calling it a "failure." "The department\'s overall lack of preparedness for this catastrophe prevented both decisive action before the storm hit and an effective response in its immediate aftermath," Collins said. "After landfall, the department far too often appeared to be frozen with indecision and nearly paralyzed by ineffective communications." "As a result, the suffering of Katrina\'s victims was worsened and prolonged."

SPECIAL REPORT \x95 Rebuilding: Vital signs \x95 Gallery: Landmarks over time \x95 Storm & Flood: Making history \x95 I-Report: Share your photos Special Report YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Disaster Relief Telecommunications Equipment Computing and Information Technology Hurricane Katrina or or Create Your Own (CNN) -- Police, firefighters, and Coast Guard crews may be the first to come to mind when naming the lifesavers during disasters such as Hurricane Katrina. It might be time to add geographers to that list. In the sometimes desperate hours following Katrina\'s landfall, experts in geographic information services -- GIS -- helped search and rescue crews reach more than 75 stranded survivors in Mississippi. One of their most valuable tools was a process called "geocoding," the conversion of street addresses into global positioning system (GPS) coordinates. With streets flooded, street signs missing, and rescue crews unfamiliar with the Gulf Coast area, street addresses were not very useful. "They would get phone calls, or the Coast Guard would come in with addresses in their hands and say, \'I need a latitude and longitude for this address.\' So the GIS professionals would do a geocoding, give it to the Coast Guard who got on helicopters and saved lives," said Shoreh Elhami, director of GISCorps. Elhami, co-founder of GISCorps, said that since 2004, the organization\'s volunteers have responded to disasters such as the Asian tsunami and Hurricane Katrina, as well as efforts to provide humanitarian relief, sustainable development, economic development, health, and education in all parts of the world. The Corps had 20 volunteers on the ground in Mississippi less than 48 hours after Katrina\'s landfall. GISCorps is part of URISA, the Urban and Regional Information Systems Association. Elhami said more than 900 qualified volunteers have GIS experience, and range from from city and state government officials to academics to people in private industry. Volunteer Beth McMillan, a field geologist and professor at the University of Arkansas in Little Rock, worked in Pearl River County, Mississippi, a couple of weeks after the storm. "A couple of days after the hurricane hit, I felt so down, and wondered what I could do. I could give a little bit of money, but that doesn\'t seem very satisfying. To be able to have a skill that can be used is much more empowering, it doesn\'t make you feel so helpless," said McMillan, back in Little Rock. Although rescue efforts were over by the time she arrived, there were scores of other tasks she and her colleagues completed. "We had laptops and map plotters, and a database that the group from the first week had put together. One map we produced showed cell phone towers in the county, and the estimated coverage of those towers. Everybody was communicating with cell phones and they needed to figure out where to go within the county to talk to one another," McMillan said. McMillan described the volunteer efforts as a sort of "Maps to Go" for a wide range of people needing immediate information. Their maps detailed road conditions, power outages, underground gas storage, and facilities with hazardous materials. Agencies from FEMA to the Red Cross to local utilities relied on the information that they constantly updated. "This is how technology can make a difference," said David Shaw, director of the GeoResources Institute at Mississippi State University. "It was a great team effort," said Shaw, for a crisis that he said had deteriorated into a Third World situation. Shaw said he was amazed at the talent and the creativity of, basically, a roomful of strangers at these county Emergency Operations Centers. While eventually satellite links and Internet connections made the tasks easier, in some cases large amounts of data had to be driven several hours from one site to another. Volunteers are never sure of the conditions they might face when deployed to disaster sites or developing countries. Assignments usually last between two weeks and two months. McMillan said her many experiences "roughing it" as a field geologist helped her deal with the living conditions in Mississippi. "They said be prepared for really hot weather, and bring a sleeping bag," she said. "I slept in an empty U.S. Department of Agriculture building on a cot, with probably several hundred other people. But it did have power, bathrooms, and showers, so conditions were not as bad as they could have been," she said. She and her colleagues ate MREs (military meals ready to eat) and worked 12-plus hour days every day. "We did get a chance to tag along one afternoon with a couple of National Guardsmen from Mississippi on a trip to the coast. That was one of the most memorable experiences of my life. I\'ve never seen such destruction, and the only way to really understand it is to see it in person," she said.

People on walkers, some with oxygen tanks, began checking in when it opened about 8 a.m.\n\nAt 11 a.m. EDT, the National Hurricane Center said Katrina\'s maximum sustained wind speed had stepped up to nearly 175 mph, with higher gusts. The hurricane\'s eye was about 225 miles south-southeast of the mouth of Mississippi River.\n\nThe storm was moving west-northwest at nearly 12 mph and was expected to turn north-northwest. Forecasters said the weather would start getting rough late Sunday and the eye would strike land early Monday but they could when.\n\nThe mayor said people who opted to go to the Superdome should take enough food and supplies to last three to five days. He said police and firefighters would fan out throughout the city telling residents to get out and that police would have the authority to commandeer any vehicle or building that could be used for evacuation or shelter.\n\nHotels were exempted from the evacuation order because airlines had canceled all flights out.\n\nTina and Bryan Steven of Forest Lake, Minn., sat glumly on a sidewalk Sunday morning outside their hotel in the French Quarter.\n\n"We\'re choosing the best of two evils," Bryan Steven said. "It\'s either be stuck in the hotel or stuck on the road."\n\nRobyn Menzel arrived in the Jackson, Miss., area about 8 a.m. Sunday with a two-car group from New Orleans, a trip of about 150 miles she said took an hour longer than usual.\n\n"They were broadcasting that this was serious and they needed everybody to leave now," said Menzel, "We left about 4:40 a.m. and it was pretty bad just getting out of New Orleans."\n\nA hurricane warning was in effect for the north-central Gulf Coast from Morgan City, La., to the Alabama-Florida line, meaning hurricane conditions were expected within 24 hours, the hurricane center said. Tropical storm warnings extended east to Indian Pass, Fla., and west to Cameron, La., a spread of about 480 miles.\n\n"Katrina is comparable in intensity to Hurricane Camille of 1969 ... only larger," specialist Richard Pasch said at the hurricane center. "Hurricanes rarely sustain such extreme winds for much time. However, we see no obvious large-scale effects to cause a substantial weakening the system, and it is expected that the hurricane will be of Category 4 or 5 intensity when it reaches the coast."\n\nStorm surges of up to 28 feet topped by waves up to 30 feet were possible in some areas, hurricane center meteorologist Chris Sisko said. Camille has the record for storm surges at 24 feet.\n\nAs much as 15 inches of rain also was possible.\n\nOnly three Category 5 hurricanes — the highest on the Saffir-Simpson scale — have hit the United States since record-keeping began. The last was 1992\'s Hurricane Andrew, which leveled parts of South Florida, killed 43 people and caused $31 billion in damage. The others were the 1935 Labor Day hurricane that hit the Florida Keys and killed 600 people and Hurricane Camille, which devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969, killing 256.\n\nKatrina\'s landfall could still come in Mississippi and affect Alabama and Florida, but it looked likely to come ashore Monday morning on the southeastern Louisiana coast, said Ed Rappaport, deputy director of the hurricane center in Miami. That put New Orleans squarely in the crosshairs.\n\n"If it came ashore with the intensity it has now and went to the New Orleans area, it would be the strongest we\'ve had in recorded history there," Rappaport said in a telephone interview Sunday morning. "We\'re hoping of course there\'ll be a slight tapering off at least of the winds, but we can\'t plan on that. So whichever area gets hit, this is going to be a once in a lifetime event for them."\n\nMandatory evacuations were ordered all along the Mississippi coast, where casinos were closed Sunday. National Guard units had already been deployed, state officials said.\n\nResidents of several barrier islands in the western Florida Panhandle also were urged to evacuate Sunday.\n\n"The water is already up to the back of homes on Pensacola Beach and Perdido Key," said Escambia County, Fla., spokeswoman Sonya Smith.\n\nKatrina had been blamed for nine deaths in South Florida. It was the sixth hurricane to hit Florida in just over a year.\n\nSome Alabama coastal residents also headed inland Sunday morning.\n\n"It\'s scary," said Joyce Allen, a building inspector at Alabama\'s coastal Dauphin Island. She covered office computers at town hall and left the barrier island, which she said already had some flooding.', 'title': 'Hurricane Katrina Threatens New Orleans', 'url': 'http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/08/28/hurricane-katrina-threatens-new-orleans.html', 'keywords': ['hit', 'katrina', 'orleans', 'florida', 'storm', 'center', 'morning', 'threatens', 'search', 'mississippi', 'hurricane', 'city'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': '"The city of New Orleans has never seen a hurricane of this magnitude hit it directly."\nNagin said he spoke to a forecaster at the hurricane center who told him that "this is the storm New Orleans has feared these many years."\nA hurricane warning was in effect for the north-central Gulf Coast from Morgan City, La., to the Alabama-Florida line, meaning hurricane conditions were expected within 24 hours, the hurricane center said.\n"Katrina is comparable in intensity to Hurricane Camille of 1969 ... only larger," specialist Richard Pasch said at the hurricane center.\nIt was the sixth hurricane to hit Florida in just over a year.', 'date': 1125187200}, {'text': 'It\'s been called the storm of the century and a monster. Hurricane Katrina will almost certainly hold the record for the biggest and costliest natural disaster in the country\'s history, and its real cost and real toll won\'t be known for years.\n\nBut what is known now is that Hurricane Katrina was not the lion people thought it was, despite the staggering devastation it inflicted across four states. A report released this week by the National Hurricane Center said that when Katrina hit land early on the morning of Aug. 29, it was a Category 3 hurricane.\n\nAfter examining devices that were dropped into Katrina from hurricane-hunter aircraft and after reviewing readings from weather stations and weather buoys, the center has concluded that Katrina\'s maximum winds at landfall were 127 mph, not 140 mph, as originally estimated. That means that on the record books Katrina drops from a Category 4 to a Category 3.\n\nEven more sobering, the study confirmed that Katrina was a Category 1 when it hit New Orleans. The city that sits below the sea, protected by its precarious levees, was on the weaker, west side of Katrina. The report said maximum sustained winds were 95 mph, with occasional gusts a little higher.\n\n"While the intensity of Katrina was Category 3 as the center of the eye made its closest approach to the east of downtown New Orleans, the strongest winds ... were likely present only over water to the east of the eye," according to the report.\n\nThat means New Orleans\' storm fortifications were much weaker than residents had been led to believe.\n\nReassessing Responses\n\n"This news further highlights the need for a full federal commitment to build the highest level of protection through levees and coastal restoration for New Orleans, south Louisiana and the Gulf Coast," Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., told New Orleans\' Times-Picayune.\n\nThe news also highlighted the need for people to reassess their response to oncoming hurricanes. The notion that a Category 1 or Category 2 hurricane is a mere lamb of a storm has been disproved over and over in the past two years.\n\nBefore Katrina tore through the Gulf states, it hit Fort Lauderdale and Miami. Katrina\'s damage in Florida was overshadowed by the devastation in Louisiana and Mississippi, but even in Miami it left huge scars. Brickell Avenue, at the center of downtown, is still a maze of boarded-up high rises in which thousands of windows were shattered.\n\nPeople were terrified and terrorized when Katrina hit. Ask them how strong Katrina was when it came through Miami and they\'ll tell you with confidence.\n\n"I know it was a Category 3," George Nordhausen told ABC News.\n\n"I think it was maybe a 4," added Gabriel Gonzalez.\n\n"Really bad," said Sherry Hall. "I think it was close to Hurricane Andrew."\n\nHurricane Andrew, which hit Florida in 1992, was a Category 5. We now know that when it hit Miami, Katrina had maximum sustained winds of 73 mph -- not enough to be called a hurricane. A storm with wind speeds below 74 mph is categorized as a tropical storm.\n\nEducation Needed\n\n"We are reminded how vulnerable we are," said Russell Pfost, senior meteorologist at the National Weather Center in Miami.\n\nRaul Rodriguez, chairman of the Florida Building Commission, said people must become better educated about hurricanes if they continue to insist on living in the hurricane zone.\n\n"The day will come when people, more than looking at an ad that has folks by a swimming pool, will be asking, \'To what standards were these buildings designed?\'" Rodriguez said. "People are going to care more about the strength of the glass of the windows than the depth of the Jacuzzi."\n\nAs for New Orleans and Mississippi, the National Hurricane Center said there are two reasons why Katrina was so damaging. It was a huge storm, with hurricane force winds 150 miles across. It had been a Category 5 when it raged over the Gulf of Mexico, and meteorologists believe that allowed it to suck up huge amounts of sea water, which created a massive storm surge.', 'title': 'Katrina Weaker Than Originally Thought', 'url': 'https://abcnews.go.com/US/HurricaneKatrina/story?id=1429373', 'keywords': ['hit', 'hurricane', 'winds', 'mph', 'katrina', 'orleans', 'weaker', 'thought', 'storm', 'center', 'miami', 'originally', 'category'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': "But what is known now is that Hurricane Katrina was not the lion people thought it was, despite the staggering devastation it inflicted across four states.\nA report released this week by the National Hurricane Center said that when Katrina hit land early on the morning of Aug. 29, it was a Category 3 hurricane.\nThe city that sits below the sea, protected by its precarious levees, was on the weaker, west side of Katrina.\nThat means New Orleans' storm fortifications were much weaker than residents had been led to believe.\nAs for New Orleans and Mississippi, the National Hurricane Center said there are two reasons why Katrina was so damaging.", 'date': None}, {'text': 'A contrite U.S. Army Corps of Engineers took responsibility Thursday for the flooding of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina and said the levees failed because they were built in a disjointed fashion using outdated data.\n\n"This is the first time that the Corps has had to stand up and say, `We\'ve had a catastrophic failure,"\' Lt. Gen. Carl Strock, the Corps chief, said as the agency issued a 6,000-page-plus report on the disaster on Day 1 of the new hurricane season.\n\nThe Corps said it will use the lessons it has learned to build better flood defenses.\n\n"Words alone will not restore trust in the Corps," Strock said, adding that the Corps is committed "to fulfilling our important responsibilities."\n\nThe $19.7 million report includes details on the engineering and design failures that allowed the storm surge to overwhelm New Orleans\' levees and floodwalls Aug. 29.\n\nMany of the findings and details on floodwall design, storm modeling and soil types have been released in pieces in recent months as the Corps sought to show it was being open about what went wrong. But the final report goes into greater depth.\n\nThe Corps, Strock said, has undergone a period of intense introspection and is "deeply saddened and enormously troubled by the suffering of so many."\n\nKatrina damaged 169 miles of the 350-mile hurricane system that protects New Orleans and was blamed for more than 1,570 deaths in Louisiana alone.\n\nRobert Bea, a University of California at Berkeley engineer and Corps critic, called Strock\'s comments and the report signs of "a leadership in growth."\n\n"They\'re catching up with the 1,000 years of progress of the Dutch," Bea said, referring to the Netherlands\' long, and mostly successful, history of battling the North Sea.\n\nThe much-anticipated report, prepared by the 150-member Interagency Performance Evaluation Task Force, assembled and headed by the Corps, is intended to serve as a road map for engineers as they seek to design and build better levees and floodwalls.\n\nMeanwhile, mobile phone companies are working on bolstering their systems to try to prevent a repeat of the havoc Katrina caused last year to its systems.\n\nA Verizon Communications spokesman said "communications is key for relief organizations, law enforcement and to help customers keep in touch" with their families.\n\nAnd Cellular South said it\'s investing more than $8 million in equipment and system upgrades to circumvent potential damage to landlines. A top executive says the company is investing an additional $78 million to add new cell sites to its network across Mississippi.\n\nSerious work began on New Orleans\' hurricane protection system in the 1960s after Hurricane Betsy flooded the city in 1965. But over the decades, funding slackened and many parts of the system were not finished by the time Katrina hit.\n\nThe result was a disjointed system of levees, inconsistent in quality, materials and design, that left gaps exploited by the storm, the report said.\n\nAlso, engineers did not take into account the poor soil quality underneath New Orleans, the report said, and failed to account for the sinking of land, which caused some sections to be as much as 2 feet lower than other parts.\n\nFour breaches in canals that run through New Orleans were caused by foundation failures that were "not considered in the original design of these structures," the report said. Those breaches caused two-thirds of the city\'s flooding.\n\nThursday\'s report urged the Corps to shift its formulaic cost-benefit approach on how it decides what projects are worthwhile. The agency was urged to look at potential environmental, societal and cultural losses, "without reducing everything to one measure such as dollars."\n\nThe report did not directly address questions raised in other studies regarding the Corps\' organizational mindset.\n\nLast month, a report by outside engineers said the Corps was dysfunctional and unreliable. That group, led by experts from the University of California at Berkeley, recommended setting up an agency to oversee the Corps\' projects nationwide.\n\nWhile the Corps reported on New Orleans\'past, Mayor Ray Nagin looked toward its future as he took the oath of office Thursday for a second term leading this storm-hobbled city, promising a better future during a ceremony held at the site of some of the worst misery caused by Katrina.\n\n"How can we do an inauguration on the same day as hurricane season? Lord, have mercy," Nagin joked in a speech that often sounded like a sermon as he recounted small miracles in the city and promised bigger ones to come.\n\nIn response to criticism after Katrina, the Corps has made fixing New Orleans\' flood protection system a top priority and tried to incorporate the task force findings.\n\nThe Corps already has spent about $800 million for repairs and improvements and plans to spend $3.7 billion over the next four years to raise and strengthen levees, increase pumping capacity and install more flood gates.\n\nA thorough assessment of the region\'s current flood defenses found no "glaring weaknesses," said Col. Richard Wagenaar, the Corps\' district chief in New Orleans.\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season runs through Nov. 30. William Gray, a leading hurricane forecaster, said Wednesday that the 2006 season should not be as destructive as 2005, which set records with 28 named storms and four major hurricanes hitting land.

Some of those concerns are solidly grounded, while others are less so, disease experts say.\n\nThe biggest immediate concern is the threat of gastrointestinal illness brought by the floods of contaminated water and lack of clean water in beleaguered New Orleans and other hurricane-struck areas. Other worries include infected wounds in people lacking medical care, a possible increase in West Nile virus as mosquitoes breed in waters left by the storm, infections from spoiled food, and the risk of common infectious diseases spreading rapidly in crowded refugee shelters.\n\nBut despite some official statements to the contrary, there is little risk that exotic diseases like cholera will erupt, experts say. And while corpses on the streets of New Orleans are a wrenching sight, they actually pose little danger of spreading disease.\n\nDr. Glenn Morris, an epidemiolgist at the University of Maryland in Baltimore, said the biggest worry is sewage-contaminated water. Quoted in a Reuters report, he said, "Just simply splashing around in the water, if there is sewage contamination there is a risk you could get it onto your hands and get it into your mouth."\n\nThe most likely contaminants are the usual culprits in water- and food-borne disease outbreaks in this country, such as Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Shigella, Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, and hepatitis A virus, said Michael T. Osterholm, PhD, MPH. He is director of the University of Minnesota Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, publisher of this Web site.\n\nSome officials this week have said the foul water could spark outbreaks of cholera and typhoid fever, but Osterholm and other experts say that\'s not likely.\n\n"Because we don\'t have a population of people with typhoid or cholera, we don\'t expect to see that," Osterholm said.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says the same thing in a hurricane-related advisory: "Unless a disease is brought into a disaster area from elsewhere, any outbreaks that occur are almost always from diseases that were already in the disaster-affected area before the disaster struck."\n\nOn the other hand, hurricane-related wounds can pose serious risks, according to Osterholm. If someone with a wound goes without medical care for 3 or 4 days, as have many in New Orleans, an infected wound can become serious or life-threatening, he said. That happened to a number of people who were hit by the tsunami in Indonesia last December, he added.\n\nAnother worry is the likelihood of a plague of mosquitoes rising from waters left by the hurricane. "Mosquito populations are likely to take off dramatically in the next 7 to 10 days," Osterholm said. He explained this will be a bigger problem in rural areas, where the storm has left behind many pools of stagnant water, than in New Orleans.\n\n"There\'ll be a tremendous nuisance mosquito situation occurring that will make life very difficult for people living there or going there to help," he said.\n\nRising with the clouds of mosquitoes will be the risk of West Nile virus infection, Osterholm added. Louisiana has already had 52 cases this summer, 40 of them involving encephalitis or meningitis, according to a CDC report published yesterday.\n\nThe CDC is working with Louisiana officials on a mosquito-control program in an effort to head off the West Nile threat, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said in a news release 2 days ago. Osterholm said mosquitoes on the Gulf Coast generally stop biting about mid-October because of an adaptation that protects them in case of frost. Until then, using insect repellent will be important.\n\nHurricane-related flooding brings other health risks as a result of increased contact between people and animals, but most do not involve infectious diseases, according to Osterholm.\n\nReports of corpses lying on New Orleans streets—besides dramatizing the depth of the tragedy—have sparked fears of disease. But those fears are overblown, authorities say.\n\n"Decaying bodies create very little risk for major disease outbreaks," says the CDC advisory.\n\nOsterholm explained that a few infectious organisms can survive for a while after their host dies, but the vast majority die soon after the infected individual dies. "The process of decomposition actually degrades the pathogens in the body," he said. The presence of bodies "is not an important means of transmitting an infectious agent in a situation like this."\n\nBecause of hurricane threats, federal agencies have been posting recommendations about food safety in the aftermath of disasters, especially the need to discard perishable food that has been warmer than 40˚F for 2 hours or more. The CDC and the US Department of Agriculture\'s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) disagree on one point: what to do with canned foods that have been exposed to floodwaters. The FSIS says such cans should be thrown out, but the CDC says the food can still be used if one washes the can and dips it in bleach solution before opening it.\n\nOsterholm said the concern is possible contamination on the outside of the can. "In most cases what\'s inside the can will be safe. If you\'re down to not having any other food, and you can disinfect the can, I\'d eat that food," he said.\n\nSo far, infectious diseases have not emerged as a major problem in Katrina\'s wake, according to an online report by the New Orleans Times-Picayune today. Kristen Meyer, a spokeswoman for the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, told the newspaper, "We haven\'t seen a lot of diseases because the things that put people at risk are being in floodwater and cleaning up after floodwater. Most evacuees haven\'t had a chance to go back home."\n\nOsterholm said the Katrina disaster offers lessons for other potential public health emergencies, such as pandemic influenza.\n\nFor example, he said, "It\'s very hard to bring public health services to a population when the overall mental health of the community is so compromised. How do you get people to, say, get in line for vaccines or to quarantine themselves, when they have that sense of despair and helplessness?"\n\nThe disaster also hints at the magnitude of the problems that a major pandemic could bring, he said. "While an influenza pandemic wouldn\'t unfold with such speed, all 50 states will be dealing with it virtually simultaneously; there won\'t be 47 other states to help the three affected states. If there was ever a time to better understand the need for preparedness and surge capacity, this should be it."\n\nSee also:\n\nCDC information on infectious disease risks after a hurricane\n\nhttp://emergency.cdc.gov/disasters/hurricanes/library/infectiousdisease.pdf\n\nUSDA FSIS guidelines on food safety after a hurricane\n\nhttp://www.fsis.usda.gov/News_&_Events/NR_082905_01/index.asp\n\nAug 31 HHS news release\n\nhttp://archive.hhs.gov/news/press/2005pres/20050831.html\n\nSep 1 CNN report on infectious disease risks in aftermath of hurricane Katrina\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2005/HEALTH/09/01/katrina.public.health/index.html', 'title': 'Hurricane Katrina sparks fears of disease outbreaks', 'url': 'http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2005/09/hurricane-katrina-sparks-fears-disease-outbreaks', 'keywords': ['osterholm', 'health', 'cdc', 'sparks', 'disease', 'katrina', 'risk', 'outbreaks', 'food', 'fears', 'infectious', 'hurricane', 'water', 'diseases'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Sep 2, 2005 (CIDRAP News) – Amid the devastation left by hurricane Katrina on the US Gulf Coast, fears of infectious disease outbreaks have added to the distress.\nHe is director of the University of Minnesota Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, publisher of this Web site.\n"Decaying bodies create very little risk for major disease outbreaks," says the CDC advisory.\nSo far, infectious diseases have not emerged as a major problem in Katrina\'s wake, according to an online report by the New Orleans Times-Picayune today.\nSee also:CDC information on infectious disease risks after a hurricanehttp://emergency.cdc.gov/disasters/hurricanes/library/infectiousdisease.pdfUSDA FSIS guidelines on food safety after a hurricanehttp://www.fsis.usda.gov/News_&_Events/NR_082905_01/index.aspAug 31 HHS news releasehttp://archive.hhs.gov/news/press/2005pres/20050831.htmlSep 1 CNN report on infectious disease risks in aftermath of hurricane Katrinahttp://www.cnn.com/2005/HEALTH/09/01/katrina.public.health/index.html', 'date': None}, {'text': 'But none of the two dozen or so evacuees losing their hotel benefits who were interviewed in New Orleans in the past two days had a permanent place to go.\n\nEven on FEMA\'s housing Web site, the pickings were slim -- only five two-bedroom apartments in the New Orleans area met the agency\'s budget of less than $800 a month.

Now those hometown heroes are doing what they can to help their friends, family and thousands of their longtime fans recover from Hurricane Katrina. "The whole town is like family, so it\'s very much a personal issue," said Peyton Manning, son of longtime New Orleans Saints quarterback Archie Manning. Peyton, quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts, and younger brother Eli, who plays for the New York Giants, mobilized a plane full of relief supplies that were delivered to Baton Rouge on Saturday. Both brothers grew up in Louisiana. Like countless other efforts across the nation, the collection and delivery of 30,000 pounds of water, Gatorade, infant formula, diapers and pillows took a lot of different players to become reality. (Watch a report on the Manning brothers\' flight.) The Manning-led effort began in Atlanta where the airplane was housed early Saturday, with about 20 employee-volunteers from AirTran Airways, flying a mostly empty aircraft to Indianapolis, Indiana, to pick up the supplies. Peyton Manning now lives in Indiana and runs a charity there. "This is not like an everyday trip," said pilot Lee Nall Jr. "We\'re just trying as best we can to add a little sanity to these people\'s lives. I\'ve done two of these trips already. I\'ll do as many as I can." When the plane landed in Indianapolis, it taxied to a staging area where local volunteers began loading supplies into the belly of the plane, onto the seats and into every overhead compartment. "I can\'t always give as much money as I would like, but I can give blood and give my time," said Becca Lang, an AirTran employee in Indianapolis. The Manning brothers helped load some of the pallets of baby formula and water. They also talked to more than a dozen reporters from Indianapolis newspapers, radio and TV stations before boarding the flight to Louisiana. Peyton Manning said he knows it\'s a balancing act for athletes and other celebrities who genuinely want to help. "I talked to the Red Cross and told them I certainly didn\'t want to get in the way, but I wanted to do whatever I could to help," he said. "They said these people are down, so any kind of morale boost we could give would be good for them, too." The Mannings have been involved in community assistance for many years. When he joined the NFL, Peyton Manning set up the PeyBack Foundation, which has since contributed money to youth organizations in Indiana, Tennessee and Louisiana. While he said he\'s contributed to other disaster funds after last year\'s tsunami, the 9/11 attacks and Florida\'s hurricanes in 2004, Peyton said knowing the streets, businesses and neighborhoods in southern Louisiana hit him hard. "It\'s just different when you have your hometown hit. It just triggers a nerve," he said. "We grew up in New Orleans, and my parents are from Mississippi. Slidell, St. Bernard -- I can just visualize them." Eli Manning said it has been difficult to see the TV pictures of the devastation in the city where he grew up. Both brothers accompanied the supplies to their old home town. "It\'s hard to watch what\'s happened to the city, people with no place to go, up to their waists in water. We just wanted to do something extra, so we set up this plan to help some of these people," he said. He also echoed Lang\'s sentiment that it\'s not just about monetary donations. "You don\'t have to be a celebrity to get involved," he said. One of the AirTran volunteers on the flight, New Orleans native Toni Pugh, said she was trying to stay busy to keep her mind off her own fears. "My daughter and grandbabies and I evacuated New Orleans just before the storm, but my husband didn\'t come," Pugh said. "Maybe he was just stubborn, but he said he wasn\'t leaving, and I haven\'t heard from him in six days." Pugh tried to take a nap in the back of the plane on the trip from Indianapolis to Baton Rouge. When she turned her cell phone back on after landing, she had a voice message that lifted a weight off her shoulders. The message was from a neighbor, who said her husband, Ralph, was safe with him and doing fine. "I just, it just all came out, tears of joy, I just couldn\'t stop shaking," she said, laughing and crying at the same time. Co-workers hugged her when they heard the good news. Scores of Red Cross volunteers at the Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport loaded the tons of supplies onto waiting trucks. "This stuff is great, and we need it so badly," said Red Cross volunteer Karyn Degenais, a school psychologist from Oregon on leave from her job to help with the relief effort in Louisiana. "This is the largest disaster in Red Cross history. We already have more than 300 shelters set up, in six states already," she said. The agency knows many more shelters will be needed, and they\'re looking as far away as Utah and Oregon, she said. "Last box!" cried out a now euphoric Pugh from inside the plane, as the final container was emptied from the coach seats, down a conveyor belt and onto a Red Cross disaster truck. "I feel so good now I could lift all these boxes myself," she said, smiling. As the empty AirTran plane taxied for its return to Atlanta, Peyton and Eli Manning headed off to spend some time in the region they call home. "We know these people; these people know us," Peyton said. "We have a connection to these people."

Many people still do not have clean drinking water or electricity, and their houses are too dangerous to live in. About 89,400 Katrina evacuees are still being housed in shelters nationwide, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe stories these evacuees tell are all different—tales of survival, charity, violence, and in at least one case, newfound love. Together they provide a glimpse into the lives of the hundreds of thousands who remain displaced by Katrina.\n\nOn a recent Saturday—more than two weeks after Katrina struck and one week before Rita—Gayle Bryan and her sister, Carolyn Crowell, sat on the bumper of their car in Louisiana\'s rural Plaquemines Parish. From their perch they looked out at Bryan\'s house about a hundred feet (30 meters) away. The house was up to the windows in water.\n\n"It\'s so close, but I can\'t get to it,\'\' Bryan said, tearing up.\n\nPlaquemines is a peninsula south of New Orleans. Its southernmost half was still under more than five feet (one and a half meters) of water. Bryan and Crowell were on the last patch of dry road before it disappeared into the floodwaters.\n\nAt their feet, bloated oranges bobbed in the brown water, the only evidence that a month ago the region was thick with orange groves. It was 4 p.m., and the pair had been there since noon, hoping someone with a boat would give them a ride to her house.\n\n"We just want to know if anything is there," Gayle said. "For closure.\'\'\n\n"There\'s Nothing Left"\n\nPeople in Plaquemines are used to floods, but Katrina\'s 30-foot (9-meter) tidal surge, which tumbled houses and drowned cattle, was like nothing residents here had ever seen.\n\n"There\'s nothing left,\'\' said Jeffrey Treadway, sitting underneath a white tarp in front of what used to be the Myrtle Grove Bar and Restaurant in the Plaquemines town of Myrtle Grove.\n\nHe spoke between bites of a FEMA-issued Meal Ready to Eat. "No one has a home," he said. "There\'s no Red Cross here.\'\'\n\nDuring the hurricane, the one-story bar was swamped by the tidal surge. The building still stands, but the roof was severely damaged, and the bar had no electricity or plumbing.\n\nBar owners Sylvia and Steve Breaux had set up the tarp and were giving away bottles of cold water. Nearly all of the dozen waterlogged chairs were taken.\n\n"Even though my business is destroyed, I can still be a good neighbor,\'\' Sylvia Breaux said.\n\n"The Water Was Up to My Chin"\n\nCassandra Brown, 45, of New Orleans, went through much of the storm\'s aftermath alone.\n\nNow reunited with her daughter, Rashonda Johnson, 31, Brown was living with about a thousand other people at the River Center, the convention center in Baton Rouge where the Red Cross had set up a shelter.\n\nThe Sunday that Katrina struck, Brown and her family took shelter at their church in New Orleans. They planned to leave the city together the next day.\n\n"My son picked me up at the church and he dropped me off at my apartment,\'\' she said. Her son couldn\'t make it back to pick her up; neither could her daughter.\n\n"I got stuck there until Wednesday morning,\'\' Brown said. She had no food, electricity, or water.\n\n"I took the time to fast and pray,\'\' she said.\n\nIn time a man with a boat came to take people out of the apartment complex, but he left Brown and several others behind. "He made just three trips,\'\' she said.\n\n"By Wednesday, the water was up to my chin,\'\' Brown said. "[But] I made up my mind to walk to safety."\n\nShe found a bus that took her to New Orleans\' convention center. But there she found little comfort.\n\n"I saw people dropping dead, people getting beat up. I saw it all. I saw it all," she said. "I stayed on the sidewalk of the convention center so I could be in the open.\'\'\n\nEventually Brown took a bus to a Howard Johnson\'s motel in Shreveport, where she called her daughter, who was at the River Center shelter. Brown took a bus to the shelter to be with her.\n\n"From this point on, where she goes, I go,\'\' Brown said.\n\nA Match Made by Katrina\n\nMonique Cavasher, 20, and Raymond Montgomery, 28, say Hurricane Katrina brought them together.\n\n"We\'re just starting a relationship,\'\' Cavasher said. The two stood outside the center in front of the security checkpoint. They had been kissing wildly. "We met behind the shelter two days ago,\'\' she said.\n\nCavasher had arrived at the shelter two days earlier, after overstaying her welcome at a friend\'s house in Baton Rouge where she had been staying since the storm hit.\n\nMontgomery, a butcher, waited out the storm with his brother, cousin, and mother in an apartment in New Orleans.\n\n"Everything was loose, flying around," he said of the wind. "After, the floodwater came.\'\'\n\nHis mother got a lift to Texas. He, his cousin, and his brother set out for dry ground nearby.\n\n"We swam," he said. "Then a boat picked us up, brought us to the parish line. I trekked in water to the causeway, and a truck picked us up and brought us to Baton Rouge.\'\'\n\nSince arriving at the shelter, Montgomery\'s brother had left for Missouri. He didn\'t know where his cousin is. He wasn\'t certain where his mother was, either.\n\n"To the best of my knowledge, she\'s with my stepfather and sister,\'\' he said.\n\nFor their part, Cavasher and Montgomery planned on staying in Baton Rouge together.\n\n"Some good things have come out of Hurricane Katrina, and he\'s one of them,\'\' Cavasher said.\n\nClearing the French Quarter\n\nNew Orleans remained mostly abandoned except for the U.S. military, which had set up base camp on the banks of the Mississippi, a stone\'s throw from the French Quarter.\n\nNext to the camp was a large tent city, housing hundreds of volunteers who had come to support the military by cooking, cleaning, and clearing debris. Among them were crews of Navajo Scouts, Native American firefighters from Arizona.\n\n"When we got here, you couldn\'t even walk down here, with the logs,\'\' said Ed Notah, leader of a crew from Fort Defiance, Arizona.\n\nNotah\'s crew was one of about a dozen U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs teams who had been staying in New Orleans on 21-day rotations.\n\nSince arriving, Notah\'s team had been busy clearing out the wreckage that Katrina left behind.\n\n"We set up base camp, we sawed broken branches, cleared sidewalks,\'\' Notah said. "The tour has been smooth.\'\'\n\nThe Navajo Scouts also cleaned up debris from Jackson Square Park in preparation for President George W. Bush\'s address there on September 15.\n\nChris Moore, 51, a volunteer with a faith-based group from Macon, Georgia, was also staying in the tent city.\n\nMoore grew up in New Orleans\'s Seventh Ward at the base of the French Quarter, not far from the camp.\n\n"Coming in last night, it was like going through a war zone," he said.

RELATED SPECIAL REPORT YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Louisiana Mississippi Disasters (General) or or Create Your Own NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- Violence disrupted relief efforts Thursday in New Orleans as authorities rescued desperate residents still trapped in the flooded city and tried to evacuate thousands of others living among corpses and human waste. Federal Emergency Management Agency Director Michael Brown said his agency was attempting to work "under conditions of urban warfare." Police snipers were stationed on the roof of their precinct, trying to protect it from armed miscreants roaming seemingly at will. Officers warned a CNN crew to stay off the streets because of escalating danger, and cautioned others about attempted shootings and rapes by groups of young men. "This is a desperate SOS," New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin said in a statement Thursday afternoon, with thousands of people stranded at the city\'s convention center with no food, water or electricity -- and fading hope. (See video on the desperate conditions -- 4:36 ) Residents expressed growing frustration with the disorder evident on the streets, raising questions about the coordination and timeliness of relief efforts. "Why is no one in charge?" asked one frustrated evacuee at the convention center. "I find it hard to believe." Government officials insisted they were putting forth their best efforts and pleaded for patience, saying further help was on the way. One displaced resident at the Louisiana Superdome issued a warning to authorities who may be headed to the stadium, where up to 30,000 people sought refuge after Monday\'s Hurricane Katrina and now await evacuation to Texas by bus. "Please don\'t send the National Guard," Raymond Cooper told CNN by telephone. "Send someone with a bullhorn outside the place that can talk to these people first." He described scenes of lawlessness and desperation, with people simply dragging corpses into corners. "They have quite a few people running around here with guns," he said. "You got these young teenage boys running around up here raping these girls." Elsewhere, groups of armed men wandered the streets, buildings smoldered and people picked through stores for what they could find. Charity Hospital, one of several facilities attempting to evacuate patients, was forced to halt the effort after coming under sniper fire. (Full story) Recovery efforts also continued Thursday in Mississippi, where Katrina smashed entire neighborhoods and killed at least 185 people. "We got hit by the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States," Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour told CNN Thursday. \'Thousands\' dead Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco gave the grim news that "thousands" of people died in the hurricane and its aftermath in New Orleans and surrounding parishes, though she said no official count had been compiled. Brown said those who ignored the city\'s mandatory evacuation order bore some responsibility. "I think the death toll may go into the thousands and, unfortunately, that\'s going to be attributable a lot to people who did not heed the advance warnings," he told CNN. (Full story) Stranded people remained in buildings, on roofs, in the backs of trucks or gathered in large groups on higher ground, with little knowledge of when -- or if -- help would come. Despite the deteriorating conditions in the city, hurricane survivors from neighboring Plaquemines Parish have started streaming into the city, according to Nagin. "We are overwhelmed and out of resources, but we welcome them with open arms and will figure this out together," the mayor said in a written statement. Police officers told CNN that some of their fellow officers had simply stopped showing up for duty, cutting manpower by 20 percent or more in some precincts. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said Thursday that 4,200 National Guard troops trained as military police will be deployed in New Orleans over the next three days, which he said would quadruple the law enforcement presence in the city. Pentagon officials said the first contingent of 100 military police officers would arrive at Louis Armstrong International Airport at 10 p.m. (11 p.m. ET) -- combat-ready for immediate deployment in New Orleans. \'Unsanitary and unsafe\' Blanco said Thursday she has requested the mobilization of 40,000 National Guard troops to restore order and assist in relief efforts. A humanitarian catastrophe unfolded at the convention center, where thousands of increasingly frustrated people waited for help amid dead bodies, feces and garbage. Numerous bodies could be seen, both inside and outside the facility, and one man died of a seizure while a CNN crew was at the scene. A National Guard helicopter dropped food and water Thursday afternoon, although the amount was far short of enough to meet the needs of the throngs that had gathered. Nagin advised those gathered at the center to march over the Crescent City Connection bridge to the west bank of the Mississippi River to find relief in neighboring Jefferson Parish. "The convention center is unsanitary and unsafe, and we are running out of supplies," said Nagin, adding that officials did not expect to have enough buses for evacuations. Brown told CNN Thursday evening that federal officials only found out about the convention center crisis earlier in the day, and that he had since directed that "all available resources" be made available there. Boat rescue teams looking for Katrina survivors told CNN they had been ordered to stand down Thursday by FEMA officials concerned about security. However, FEMA issued a statement from Washington denying it had suspended operations, though the agency conceded there had been "isolated incidents where security has become an issue." Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said that the Coast Guard has rescued about 3,000 people from flooded areas in New Orleans and the surrounding parishes. At the city\'s airport, a field hospital set up by FEMA was "overwhelmed" with patients, a medical team commander said. Equipment normally used to move luggage was instead ferrying patients to a treatment center and to planes and buses for evacuation. "I do not have the words in my vocabulary to describe what is happening here," said Ozro Henderson. "\'Catastrophe\' and \'disaster\' don\'t explain it." Outside the Superdome, throngs of people waiting for a bus ride to Texas completely covered an outside plaza, where they waited in the heat and rain. Buses ferried displaced residents to Houston\'s Astrodome, which will serve as a shelter until FEMA can come up with more permanent housing. "We\'re finding more and more people coming out of the woodwork," Brown said. "They\'re appearing in places we didn\'t know they existed." Blanco said more school buses would be brought in from across Louisiana to increase the pace of the evacuation. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said it expected to complete the sealing off of the 17th Street Canal, where a flood-control levee breached. (Recovery efforts) Other developments In Washington, the Senate convened in special session Thursday night and approved a $10.5 billion disaster relief request from the Bush administration. The House is expected to do the same when it takes up the matter Friday. (Full story) Gasoline prices spiked as high as $5 a gallon in some areas Thursday as consumers fearing a gas shortage raced to the pumps. The runup in prices prompted Bush to warn against gouging and to encourage Americans to conserve. (Full story) CNN\'s Chris Lawrence and Ed Lavandera contributed to this report.

Armed dolphins, trained by the US military to shoot terrorists and pinpoint spies underwater, may be missing in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nExperts who have studied the US navy's cetacean training exercises claim the 36 mammals could be carrying 'toxic dart' guns. Divers and surfers risk attack, they claim, from a species considered to be among the planet's smartest. The US navy admits it has been training dolphins for military purposes, but has refused to confirm that any are missing.\n\nDolphins have been trained in attack-and-kill missions since the Cold War. The US Atlantic bottlenose dolphins have apparently been taught to shoot terrorists attacking military vessels. Their coastal compound was breached during the storm, sweeping them out to sea. But those who have studied the controversial use of dolphins in the US defence programme claim it is vital they are caught quickly.\n\nLeo Sheridan, 72, a respected accident investigator who has worked for government and industry, said he had received intelligence from sources close to the US government's marine fisheries service confirming dolphins had escaped.\n\n'My concern is that they have learnt to shoot at divers in wetsuits who have simulated terrorists in exercises. If divers or windsurfers are mistaken for a spy or suicide bomber and if equipped with special harnesses carrying toxic darts, they could fire,' he said. 'The darts are designed to put the target to sleep so they can be interrogated later, but what happens if the victim is not found for hours?'\n\nUsually dolphins were controlled via signals transmitted through a neck harness. 'The question is, were these dolphins made secure before Katrina struck?' said Sheridan.\n\nThe mystery surfaced when a separate group of dolphins was washed from a commercial oceanarium on the Mississippi coast during Katrina. Eight were found with the navy's help, but the dolphins were not returned until US navy scientists had examined them.\n\nSheridan is convinced the scientists were keen to ensure the dolphins were not the navy's, understood to be kept in training ponds in a sound in Louisiana, close to Lake Pontchartrain, whose waters devastated New Orleans.\n\nThe navy launched the classified Cetacean Intelligence Mission in San Diego in 1989, where dolphins, fitted with harnesses and small electrodes planted under their skin, were taught to patrol and protect Trident submarines in harbour and stationary warships at sea.\n\nCriticism from animal rights groups ensured the use of dolphins became more secretive. But the project gained impetus after the Yemen terror attack on the USS Cole in 2000.

At every level – individual, corporate, philanthropic, and governmental – we failed to meet the challenge that was Katrina."\n\nExcerpts from a draft of the report, which is due for release Wednesday, obtained by CBS News said "a blinding lack of situational awareness and disjointed decision making needlessly compounded and prolonged Katrina\'s horror."\n\nCBS News correspondent Bob Fuss reports that the draft report said President Bush\'s Homeland Security team didn\'t analyze or act effectively on the information it had after Katrina hit, that Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff failed to do what he was supposed to and that the federal government "stumbled" into its response for the first several days after Katrina came ashore.\n\nThe report is being released as Chertoff announced wide-ranging changes to the nation\'s embattled Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nThe former FEMA chief likely will get a grilling from the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which was going to hold a hearing on the subject on Tuesday. Late Monday, that hearing was postponed; a new date for the hearing has yet to be announced.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, will be leading the questioning of Chertoff.

They stretch at least to the ceiling of the troposphere – the atmosphere’s lowest layer. The heat in the “hot tower” is generated by water vapour condensing into liquid water.\n\nThe hot towers, also known as convective bursts, are significant because scientists think they could be a precursor to a hurricane intensifying, a process that is still not well understood.\n\n“We think they may form right before storms intensify – and intensity change is one of the Holy Grail processes,” says Marshall Shepherd, deputy project scientist of the Global Precipitation Measurement Mission (GPMM) and research meteorologist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Green Belt, Maryland, US. “Over the years in hurricane forecasting, we’ve gotten fairly good in forecasting where the storm’s going to track.”\n\nBut predicting hurricane intensity is not as easy. If people in coastal cities could get a better warning of when hurricane winds speeds are about to increase, they might be able to prepare their communities for a stronger storm.\n\nSupercharged pistons\n\nThe vigorous convection of the hot towers releases a lot of energy in a short amount of time into the centre of a hurricane, acting like supercharged pistons in the hurricane’s engine. This can result in a lower surface pressure, which causes the wind speed to increase.\n\nThis is what appears to have happened with Katrina. As well as the GPMM images, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite, run by NASA and the Japanese space agency, also saw at least two hot towers. The tower closest to the eye’s wall measured 16 kilometres high. Soon after the TRMM image was taken, Katrina intensified to a Category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale.\n\nTRMM was launched in 1997 and was the first satellite to spot a hot tower. With its radar, TRMM measures rainfall intensity in a storm. Hurricane Bonnie in 1998 produced several hot towers as high as 18 kilometres.\n\nAnother NASA satellite, Aqua, measures the surface water temperature in the Atlantic Ocean. In 2005, its Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer instrument has observed that water in the Atlantic basin is an average of 2-4°C warmer than in previous years.\n\nWarmer waters make it easier for hurricanes to form and could be one of the reasons there have been more hurricanes than usual this season.\n\nView a NASA movie (mpg format) of sea surface temperatures and clouds from June 9 to August 29, showing the different tracks of Hurricanes Dennis, Emily, and at the end Katrina.', 'title': 'Satellites spot \x91hot towers’ in Hurricane Katrina', 'url': 'https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7929-satellites-spot-hot-towers-in-hurricane-katrina/', 'keywords': ['trmm', 'towers', 'spot', 'image', 'tower', 'katrina', 'surface', 'hot', 'hurricanes', 'satellites', 'hurricane', 'water'], 'tags': {'Space', 'Earth', 'News'}, 'summary': '(Image: NASA/JAXA) (Image: NASA/SVS) (Image: NASA)Satellite images of Hurricane Katrina indicate the storm experienced several “hot tower” clouds during its development, say NASA.\nAdvertisementThunderstorms surround the eye of hurricanes and hot towers are tall rain clouds that reach far above the rest of the hurricane near the wall of the eye.\nThe heat in the “hot tower” is generated by water vapour condensing into liquid water.\nTRMM was launched in 1997 and was the first satellite to spot a hot tower.\nHurricane Bonnie in 1998 produced several hot towers as high as 18 kilometres.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'Hurricane Katrina discussion raises more questions than answers on race, class\n\nHazel Markus David Brady\n\nWhy does the United States provide such a small safety net for its poor and needy citizens relative to almost all other industrialized nations?\n\nWhy didn\'t anyone learn the lessons of so many past floods and curb development in marshlands and flood plains before Hurricane Katrina hit?\n\nShould Americans expect their government to take care of them in times of disaster, or are they better off depending on the charity of individuals? Is there even such a thing as genuine charity, or are all acts of altruism inspired by more selfish motives?\n\nAnd finally, does President Bush care about black people?\n\nClearly, a recent discussion series on Hurricane Katrina sponsored by Stanford\'s Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity produced more questions than answers.\n\nYet the series of discussions, "Confronting Katrina: Race, Class and Disaster in American Society," offered an honest, no-holds-barred look beyond the news headlines at the complex causes of the disaster in New Orleans and its likely effects on public attitudes and policies. The series, which featured speakers from the various humanities departments as well as the graduate schools of law and business, examined Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath from a perspective of land development, race relations, philosophy and government.\n\nCentral to all these talks was a consideration of the significant role the media played in shaping the public\'s understanding of the event. As Hazel Markus, the Davis-Brack Professor in the Behavioral Sciences, stressed, "Most of us did not experience the fear of 150 mile-per-hour winds, the terror of climbing onto a rooftop to stay dry or the panic of not being able to reach family. We viewed it from the comfort of our own homes."\n\nMarkus argued that the gap between representation and reality, inevitable in news coverage, was particularly blatant in the aftermath of Katrina. Blacks caught on camera taking goods out of stores were routinely said to be "looting," she noted, while white people doing the exact same thing were said in captions to be looking for food or supplies.\n\nFor Markus and other professors in the discussion, this sort of distortion of fact by the media was nothing new. What was different about the coverage of Katrina was that many of the people watching the events unfold from the comfort of their own homes took notice of the bias and voiced their outrage, which fueled a different portrayal of events in the alternative media, blogs and even popular hip-hop music.\n\n"Katrina was not simply a wake-up call; it brought people out of their state of complacency," said Marcyliena Morgan, associate professor of communication. "The hip-hop generation, with its long memory, will not forget about what happened."\n\nMorgan referenced surveys conducted over the past several weeks to illustrate how dramatically race influenced perceptions of Katrina. Asked whether the government had responded to the storm swiftly enough, far more blacks than whites expressed dissatisfaction. And when the question was whether President Bush cared about black people, opinions were even more racially divided. The overwhelming majority of whites responded "yes," and most of the blacks surveyed said "no."\n\nRemarkably, this intense discussion of race had its moments of levity, most notably when one speaker showcased a newspaper article on some prominent African Americans who voiced their outrage. The report mistakenly identified hip-hop artist Kanye West as Cornel West, a Princeton University professor well known for his studies of race and religion. Audiences also were amused to recall President Bush\'s speech days after the hurricane when, instead of addressing the suffering of masses, he focused on the damage endured by one particular senator, Trent Lott, the Republican from Mississippi. Bush talked of his sadness upon learning of Lott\'s destroyed home, and spoke lightly of how a new and improved Lott home would rise from the rubble.\n\nAs that gaffe showed, class has become as important an issue as race, both in the response to Katrina and the media coverage of it. David Palumbo-Liu, a professor of comparative literature, offered a number of statistics to suggest how U.S. policies had failed to protect its poorest citizens. He cited the relatively small amount devoted to social programs in the United States as well as falling tax rates, particularly for the wealthiest citizens, which have left fewer resources available for emergency response.\n\nDebra Satz, associate professor of philosophy, concurred, saying Hurricane Katrina may have been improperly labeled a natural disaster since its most disastrous consequences seemed to be the result of poor planning and grossly insufficient response. "Hurricane Katrina was unusual not so much for its strength but for the way it endured and festered," she said. "A week after the disaster there were still bodies floating around the city."\n\nSatz said that while massive storms are not necessarily preventable, they are predictable. Failure to respond to repeated warnings about aging levees surrounding New Orleans or to implement an evacuation plan for a population largely dependent on public transportation, she said, begged for a distinction to be drawn between simple misfortune and serious injustice. "The government\'s inaction in the face of the disaster was an act of passive injustice," she said. She asked the audience to consider whether the country had relied too much on voluntary charity to handle a disaster created largely by a negligent government.\n\nWhile everyone might hope that the massive loss of lives and homes and the strong public outcry following Hurricane Katrina would lead to significant change in government policies, some panelists were skeptical. David Brady of the Graduate School of Business offered a historical view of disasters in the United States and noted that that when it came to respecting the sheer force of nature, many Americans seemed to have a short memory.\n\nThe Bowen H. and Janice Arthur McCoy Professor in Leadership Values, a professor of political science and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, Brady recalled the massive flooding along the Mississippi River in 1993 which, like Katrina, produced widespread death and devastation and seemed at the time to leave a lasting lesson about the hazards of building on flood plains. Indeed, more federal funds were allocated for flood prevention and disaster assistance after the 1993 floods. But the reality, Brady said, is that that much of that money ultimately ended up in local pork barrel legislation used to fund even more development in flood-prone areas.\n\n"Today on the Mississippi, there is a higher probability than there was 12 years ago that rain will generate flooding," he said.\n\nAndrea Orr is a freelance writer.', 'title': 'Hurricane Katrina discussion raises more questions than answers on race, class', 'url': 'https://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/november16/katrina-111605.html', 'keywords': ['disaster', 'states', 'katrina', 'answers', 'questions', 'class', 'united', 'race', 'raises', 'hurricane', 'media', 'series', 'discussion', 'professor'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Hurricane Katrina discussion raises more questions than answers on race, classHazel Markus David BradyWhy does the United States provide such a small safety net for its poor and needy citizens relative to almost all other industrialized nations?\nWhy didn\'t anyone learn the lessons of so many past floods and curb development in marshlands and flood plains before Hurricane Katrina hit?\nClearly, a recent discussion series on Hurricane Katrina sponsored by Stanford\'s Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity produced more questions than answers.\n"Hurricane Katrina was unusual not so much for its strength but for the way it endured and festered," she said.\nWhile everyone might hope that the massive loss of lives and homes and the strong public outcry following Hurricane Katrina would lead to significant change in government policies, some panelists were skeptical.', 'date': 1132099200}, {'text': 'Please enable cookies on your web browser in order to continue.\n\nThe new European data protection law requires us to inform you of the following before you use our website:\n\nWe use cookies and other technologies to customize your experience, perform analytics and deliver personalized advertising on our sites, apps and newsletters and across the Internet based on your interests.

The rescuers marked each house where there was no one left. Huge semis carried bodies to morgues, and federal officials ordered 25,000 body bags. Boats remained the best way to get the remaining residents to safety. The water began to go down, but it is reportedly dangerously polluted.\n\nSupplies arrived from around the world, and officials said donors in the U.S. have already contributed more than $500 million for relief. At the same time, Katrina survivors have been evacuated to emergency centers such as the Astrodome in Houston and also to communities throughout the U.S., where residents have welcomed them and children have started school.\n\nThere were also a few people who had fled the city who were allowed back in. One of them was the Episcopal Bishop of Louisiana, Charles Jenkins, and Deborah Potter went with him.\n\nDEBORAH POTTER: The water still stands 18 inches deep at Carrollton Presbyterian Church in New Orleans. It’s impossible for a car to go any farther down the road, where other churches are said to be submerged or destroyed.

Besides, the parishioners are gone. Hundreds of thousands of people have moved up the road to Baton Rouge.\n\nThe Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans had one of the largest parochial school systems in the country, with 50,000 students. Some of them have already started classes in Baton Rouge. Our Lady of Mercy took in 175, outfitting them with uniforms, books and backpacks in a matter of days. But church officials insist it’s only temporary.\n\nFather WILLIAM MAESTRI (Superintendent of Schools, Archdiocese of New Orleans): There are many people right now in New Orleans who are talking about “the city is over, the city has ended, it’s time to move on, we don’t want to rebuild.” The Archdiocese of New Orleans wants no part of that message. Our commitment is to rebuild, renew and be part of the renaissance of the City of New Orleans, of which education has to be primary.\n\nPOTTER: Some of the tiniest survivors of Hurricane Katrina have found a temporary home at First Baptist Church, now a shelter for mothers with infants. First Baptist is working with other downtown churches of different denominations to provide food, support and supplies, which keep pouring in from as far away as Michigan.\n\nSTU KAIL (Grace Church, Jackson, Michigan) A lot of it was the Internet.

How has the congregation managed?\n\nPastor BURN PAGE (First Baptist Church): I don’t know. I think it is God’s grace day by day, and his grace is sufficient, and it has been. His grace has been seen in a lot of different ways, the way some people have come here and then reunited with their families.\n\nPOTTER: After being separated for almost two weeks, Sequin and Shelita Brimmer found their sister, Dorothea Lodge, at First Baptist, along with her baby girl, Havan, born two days before the storm roared through.\n\nSHELITA BRIMMER: We know God is in full control of the whole situation. This could never happen had he not done this. We know it was God. Nobody but Jesus could have done this.\n\nPOTTER: For the congregation of First Baptist, it’s all been a learning experience.\n\nPastor PAGE: I think what they’re learning is that they’re learning what church is all about. A lot of times church is something that we go to for an hour or two on Sunday, and then we forget about it until next Sunday. God has commissioned us to reach people and to care for people, and that’s what they are doing. They’re actually living out what being the church truly means.\n\nPOTTER: Churches have called in trained professionals, too, of course. Victim-relief chaplains are ministering to the homeless jamming evacuation centers in Baton Rouge.\n\nIn New Orleans, Bishop Jenkins is getting his first look at the historic cathedral, built 200 years ago this fall.\n\nBishop JENKINS: Well, I think we’ve been delivered.\n\nPOTTER: The building is almost unscathed, the stained glass windows glorious in the sunshine.\n\nBishop JENKINS: Over waters of death walks eternal life.

Some refused outright. Others went back and forth on the decision. Still others tentatively agreed but changed their minds at the last minute.\n\nMr. Schultz\'s two daughters pleaded with him to leave. "He said, \'The property didn\'t get water during Camille -- I\'ll be fine,"\' his older daughter, Brooke M. Schultz of Woodstock, Ga., said. "It was pretty heated. He just didn\'t want to leave."\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. and Mrs. Maxey evacuated their home last year for Hurricane Ivan and joined their youngest son, Roger, in Jackson.\n\n"With traffic, it took them eight hours to reach Jackson," recalled James T. Maxey, another son, who was staying with his parents when Hurricane Katrina hit. "Normally, it\'s a three-hour drive. It was difficult for my mother to travel with my father. He was 92 and he\'d been sick. He couldn\'t do anything by himself. It was difficult for her to get him in and out of the car."\n\nHurricane Ivan delivered just a few inches of rain to Mississippi, and the Maxeys decided afterward that they did not want to evacuate again.\n\n"I wanted us to leave, purely as a precautionary measure," James Maxey said. "I thought the house would be O.K. When they were fairly adamant about staying, I said, \'All right."\'\n\nSome victims were worried about their belongings or pets. Mr. Bishop, who often spent time on his porch, did not want to leave his Ford pickup behind and told his nephew, who had evacuated, that he would follow.\n\n"He was just messing around," a niece, Mary N. Jones of Ocean Springs, Miss., said. "Two or three people came back to get him. He said he was coming on his own. He didn\'t want to leave his truck there. He was going to take it with him."\n\nMs. Knoblock, the widow who liked to garden, knew it would be difficult to take her chow chow, Jimmy, and her Labrador, Herman, to a shelter. Besides, her daughter Kim was with her, along with her two chow chows.\n\n"I pleaded with her, and my brother pleaded with her," said her daughter Angelique Mulina, the youngest of three siblings. "I knew, and my brother knew, what was coming. But she wasn\'t seeing it, and neither was my sister."\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMany victims died with their spouses or children. In Bay St. Louis, Kim E. Bell, 51, and her son Steforno, 21. In Pass Christian, Samuel F. Tart, 51, and his son, John, 2. In Ocean Springs, James E. Hyre, 83, and his wife, Shamsi, 75. His body was found in their house, hers just outside, presumably swept along by the surge.\n\nIn at least two instances, the deluge swallowed entire families.\n\nIn Ocean Springs, Nadine A. Gifford died in her house with her husband, Ted; her daughter Linda A. deSilvey; and her granddaughter Donna K. deSilvey.\n\nIn Waveland, four members of the Bane family, Edgar and Christina and their sons, Edgar Jr., 15, and Carl, 13, drowned in their modest one-story brick house.\n\nMr. Bane, a stocker at Wal-Mart, and Mrs. Bane, a hotel housekeeper, worried about their sons, who had autism.\n\n"One of the reasons they wouldn\'t evacuate or go to a shelter is that they were afraid the boys would be picked on," Mrs. Bane\'s youngest sister, Rachel R. Rimmer of Ridgefield, said. "They were very protective of them."\n\nOn Aug. 28, the night before the storm, Mr. and Mrs. Brugger, the innkeepers, provided food at their bed-and-breakfast for emergency workers who had gathered in Pass Christian to prepare for the aftermath of the storm. On the morning of Aug. 29, Mr. Brugger was interviewed by telephone by Pulse 24, a television news program in Toronto.\n\n"We just found out by watching on the battery-powered TV that the eye of the storm is apparently tracking this way," Mr. Brugger said. "I don\'t think we\'re going to have the eye come over us, but it\'s going to be just to the west of us, which is a little bit worrisome."\n\nAsked why he did not leave, Mr. Brugger replied: "The house was built in 1860. We\'ve got 15 years of sweat in it, restoring it. It was an old hotel, and it\'s been through some big storms. It\'s the highest spot in town. Our elevation is about 30 feet. So we can usually ride out the storm surge."\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Brugger died that morning when the storm obliterated the inn, which had been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Nothing was left but the concrete porch.\n\nThe mourning in Mississippi has begun in earnest. At the funeral homes that Hurricane Katrina did not destroy, there are waits up to four weeks to schedule services. Some families have chosen to skip the church eulogies and hold a simple graveside service. Cremation has become more popular.\n\nAs the detritus from the storm is cleared, the death toll could grow. The Army Corps of Engineers estimates that the hurricane left 18million to 20million cubic yards of debris in Mississippi alone, the equivalent of 200 football fields piled 50 feet high, and that it will take eight months to clear the roadways.\n\nCoroners are hiring so-called spotters to check the landfills for signs of remains.\n\nIn Pass Christian, a stone plaque has been placed on the porch of what used to be the Harbour Oaks Inn.

"At every level -- individual, corporate, philanthropic and governmental -- we failed to meet the challenge that was Katrina. In this cautionary tale, all the little pigs built houses of straw."\n\nCNN obtained advance excerpts from a draft of the lengthy report titled "Failure of Initiative," which gives 90 recommendations for changes in the wake of the Katrina disaster.\n\nThe report is the result of a Republican 11-member House select committee that investigated the response to Katrina at the local, state and federal levels. (Poll: Are feds doing enough to rebuild?)\n\nA staff member of the panel provided the excerpts, insisting on anonymity because the report will not be released until Wednesday.\n\nU.S. Rep. Christopher Shays, a Republican of Connecticut and committee member, said Monday that the report is "very tough on the president, it\'s very tough on the Department of Homeland Security. It\'s a blistering report. But I think it\'s fair."\n\nThe president\'s homeland security adviser, Frances Townsend, took issue with the suggestion that Bush not fully involved, saying the president was "hotly engaged" in the hurricane preparation efforts and in dealing with the storm\'s aftermath.\n\n"I reject outright the suggestion that President Bush was anything less than fully involved," she said.\n\n"While we should not pull any punches in our assessment of what went wrong, it does a disservice to all when we judge in retrospect the decisions made and the action taken in the midst of a major disaster, without consideration of the fuller context."\n\nThe panel found that Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff was "detached" and that then-Federal Emergency Management Agency Director Michael Brown was "clueless," Shays said.\n\nIn one of the excerpts, Chertoff was chided for executing critical responsibilities "late, ineffectively or not at all."\n\nBrown testified Friday before a Senate panel, saying he felt he had been made a scapegoat and blaming the government\'s slow response to Katrina largely on bureaucratic hassles. He also said the Department of Homeland Security was too focused on terrorism, to the detriment of preparations for natural disasters. (Full story)\n\nChertoff rejects criticism\n\nIn a speech to the National Emergency Management Association, a gathering of state-level first responders, in Alexandria, Virginia, Chertoff rejected that criticism and announced new steps to improve his department\'s ability to respond to disasters. The changes include a request for a 10 percent increase in FEMA\'s budget for 2007 and new systems to get relief supplies to disaster victims.\n\nMost of the congressional report excerpts mentioning Bush complain that he failed to receive important information.\n\nThe House select panel\'s investigation was separate from the one run by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\nThe Democratic leadership refused to participate in the House panel, arguing it would be a whitewash for the White House -- an allegation Shays and other Republicans denied.\n\nBut Democratic Reps. Charlie Melancon and William Jefferson of Louisiana took part in the committee\'s hearings, writing in a separate report released over the weekend that the need for an independent investigation remains.\n\nThe House committee "worked diligently" to meet its mandate of conducting "a full and complete investigation," the two congressmen wrote. "But due to the committee\'s short deadline and the refusal of the White House to provide access to essential documents, key questions remain unanswered. We therefore renew our call for an independent commission to examine the disastrous response to Hurricane Katrina."\n\nThe two lawmakers said the report "largely eschews direct responsibility."\n\nThe Democrats\' report calls for Chertoff to be fired. Melancon and Jefferson wrote that the majority report fails to "draw the logical conclusion to its own findings and recommend Secretary Chertoff\'s removal from office. Our judgment, based on a careful review of the record, is that the Department of Homeland Security needs new and more experienced leadership."\n\nA spokesman for Chertoff acknowledged problems with the Katrina response but called it is "outrageous" to suggest the secretary should be dismissed.\n\nPanel: \'America is still not ready for prime time\'\n\nThe House committee\'s report noted widespread failures among government agencies to share critical information in the wake of Katrina and equally widespread confusion over issues of responsibility.\n\nBut it also looked at the government\'s failure to respond to a catastrophe that had long been predicted.\n\n"In many respects, our report is a litany of mistakes, misjudgments, lapses and absurdities all cascading together, blinding us to what was coming and hobbling any collective effort to respond," one of the draft excerpts said.\n\n"Too often there were too many cooks in the kitchen, and because of that the response to Katrina was at times overdone, at times underdone. Too often, because everybody was in charge, nobody was in charge," the committee said.\n\n"If this is what happens when we have advance warning, we shudder to imagine the consequences when we do not. Four and a half years after 9/11, America is still not ready for prime time. This is particularly distressing because we know we remain at risk for terrorist attacks, and because the 2006 hurricane season is right around the corner."\n\nHaving a national response plan to deal with disasters "is not enough," the committee said.\n\n"What\'s needed is a National Action Plan. Not a plan that says Washington will do everything, but one that says, when all else fails, the federal government must do something, whether it\'s formally requested or not. Not even the perfect bureaucratic storm of flaws and failures can wash away the fundamental governmental responsibility to protect public health and safety," the panel said.\n\nWhile providing an indictment that could trigger change, the report does not necessarily contain any revelations, instead offering a series of recommendations. As the report noted, "What this committee has done is not rocket science."\n\nAmid the horror of Katrina, the report said, some things went well when the hurricane struck August 29. In much of the Gulf Coast, evacuations went smoothly -- though the report found that declarations of a mandatory evacuation "were delayed or never made in metropolitan New Orleans."\n\nThe report also extolled moments of heroism by rescue officials in the wake of the storm.', 'title': "Report: Katrina response a 'failure of leadership'", 'url': 'http://edition.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/02/13/katrina.congress/index.html', 'keywords': ['response', 'hurricane', 'committee', 'katrina', 'failure', 'panel', 'house', 'security', 'homeland', 'report', 'leadership'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Report: Katrina response a \'failure of leadership\'Homeland Security secretary described as \'detached\'WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A congressional report to be released this week slams the government\'s response to Hurricane Katrina, calling it a "failure of leadership" that left people stranded when they were most in need.\nThe report is the result of a Republican 11-member House select committee that investigated the response to Katrina at the local, state and federal levels.\nWe therefore renew our call for an independent commission to examine the disastrous response to Hurricane Katrina."\nOur judgment, based on a careful review of the record, is that the Department of Homeland Security needs new and more experienced leadership."\nA spokesman for Chertoff acknowledged problems with the Katrina response but called it is "outrageous" to suggest the secretary should be dismissed.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'Hurricane Katrina is a punishment meted out by God as a result of U.S. President George W.

(See the video on a local paper\'s prophetic warning -- 3:30 )\n\n"That \'perfect storm\' of a combination of catastrophes exceeded the foresight of the planners, and maybe anybody\'s foresight," Chertoff said.\n\nHe called the disaster "breathtaking in its surprise."\n\nBut engineers say the levees preventing this below-sea-level city from being turned into a swamp were built to withstand only Category 3 hurricanes. And officials have warned for years that a Category 4 could cause the levees to fail. (See video of why the levee\'s breech was devastating -- 1:53)\n\nKatrina was a Category 4 hurricane when it struck the Gulf Coast on August 29.\n\nLast week, Michael Brown, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, told CNN his agency had recently planned for a Category 5 hurricane hitting New Orleans.\n\nSpeaking to "Larry King Live" on August 31, in the wake of Katrina, Brown said, "That Category 4 hurricane caused the same kind of damage that we anticipated. So we planned for it two years ago. Last year, we exercised it. And unfortunately this year, we\'re implementing it."\n\nBrown suggested FEMA -- part of the Department of Homeland Security -- was carrying out a prepared plan, rather than having to suddenly create a new one.\n\nChertoff argued that authorities actually had assumed that "there would be overflow from the levee, maybe a small break in the levee. The collapse of a significant portion of the levee leading to the very fast flooding of the city was not envisioned."\n\nHe added: "There will be plenty of time to go back and say we should hypothesize evermore apocalyptic combinations of catastrophes. Be that as it may, I\'m telling you this is what the planners had in front of them. They were confronted with a second wave that they did not have built into the plan, but using the tools they had, we have to move forward and adapt."\n\nBut New Orleans, state and federal officials have long painted a very different picture.\n\n"We certainly understood the potential impact of a Category 4 or 5 hurricane" on New Orleans, Lt. General Carl Strock, chief of engineers for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, said Thursday, Cox News Service reported.\n\nReuters reported that in 2004, more than 40 state, local and volunteer organizations practiced a scenario in which a massive hurricane struck and levees were breached, allowing water to flood New Orleans. Under the simulation, called "Hurricane Pam," the officials "had to deal with an imaginary storm that destroyed more than half a million buildings in New Orleans and forced the evacuation of a million residents," the Reuters report said.\n\nIn 2002 the New Orleans Times-Picayune ran a five-part series exploring the vulnerability of the city. The newspaper, and other news media as well, specifically addressed the possibility of massive floods drowning residents, destroying homes and releasing toxic chemicals throughout the city. (Read: "Times-Picayune" Special Report: Washing away )\n\nScientists long have discussed this possibility as a sort of doomsday scenario.\n\nOn Sunday, a day before Hurricane Katrina made landfall, Ivor van Heerden, director of the Louisiana State University Public Health Research Center in Baton Rouge, said, "This is what we\'ve been saying has been going to happen for years."\n\n"Unfortunately, it\'s coming true," he said, adding that New Orleans "is definitely going to flood."\n\nAlso on Sunday, Placquemines Parish Sheriff Jeff Hingle referred back to Hurricane Betsy -- a Category 2 hurricane that struck in 1965 -- and said, "After Betsy these levees were designed for a Category 3."\n\nHe added, "These levees will not hold the water back."\n\nBut Chertoff seemed unaware of all the warnings.\n\n"This is really one which I think was breathtaking in its surprise," Chertoff said. "There has been, over the last few years, some specific planning for the possibility of a significant hurricane in New Orleans with a lot of rainfall, with water rising in the levees and water overflowing the levees," he told reporters Saturday.\n\nThat alone would be "a very catastrophic scenario," Chertoff said. "And although the planning was not complete, a lot of work had been done. But there were two problems here. First of all, it\'s as if someone took that plan and dropped an atomic bomb simply to make it more difficult. We didn\'t merely have the overflow, we actually had the break in the wall. And I will tell you that, really, that perfect storm of combination of catastrophes exceeded the foresight of the planners, and maybe anybody\'s foresight."\n\nChertoff also argued that authorities did not have much notice that the storm would be so powerful and could make a direct hit on New Orleans.\n\n"It wasn\'t until comparatively late, shortly before -- a day, maybe a day and a half, before landfall -- that it became clear that this was going to be a Category 4 or 5 hurricane headed for the New Orleans area."\n\nAs far back as Friday, August 26, the National Hurricane Center was predicting the storm could be a Category 4 hurricane at landfall, with New Orleans directly in its path. Still, storms do change paths, so the possibility existed that it might not hit the city.\n\nBut the National Weather Service prediction proved almost perfect.\n\nKatrina made landfall on Monday, August 29.\n\nTens of thousands of people in New Orleans who did not or could not heed the mandatory evacuation orders issued the day before the storm made landfall were left in dire straits.\n\n"I think we have discovered over the last few days that with all the tremendous effort using the existing resources and the traditional frameworks of the National Guard, the unusual set of challenges of conducting a massive evacuation in the context of a still dangerous flood requires us to basically break the traditional model and create a new model -- one for what you might call kind of an ultracatastrophe," Chertoff said.\n\nHe vowed that the United States "is going to move heaven and earth" to rescue those in need.', 'title': 'Chertoff: Katrina scenario did not exist', 'url': 'http://edition.cnn.com/2005/US/09/03/katrina.chertoff/', 'keywords': ['water', 'katrina', 'orleans', 'levees', 'landfall', 'chertoff', 'storm', 'scenario', 'exist', 'hurricane', 'city', 'category', 'officials'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Chertoff: Katrina scenario did not existHowever, experts for years had warned of threat to New OrleansWASHINGTON (CNN) -- Defending the U.S. government\'s response to Hurricane Katrina, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff argued Saturday that government planners did not predict such a disaster ever could occur.\nBut in fact, government officials, scientists and journalists have warned of such a scenario for years.\nChertoff, fielding questions from reporters, said government officials did not expect both a powerful hurricane and a breach of levees that would flood the city of New Orleans.\nSpeaking to "Larry King Live" on August 31, in the wake of Katrina, Brown said, "That Category 4 hurricane caused the same kind of damage that we anticipated.\nChertoff argued that authorities actually had assumed that "there would be overflow from the levee, maybe a small break in the levee.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'Please enable cookies on your web browser in order to continue.\n\nThe new European data protection law requires us to inform you of the following before you use our website:\n\nWe use cookies and other technologies to customize your experience, perform analytics and deliver personalized advertising on our sites, apps and newsletters and across the Internet based on your interests.

Here’s a rundown of the major provisions:\n\nNo Change in Tax Filing Status Due to Relocation:\n\nHurricane victims who have been forced to live with friends, relatives, or in other kinds of temporary housing will not lose various tax benefits due to the change in their living situation. To avoid this, they will be allowed to use their 2004 income to calculate their eligibility for such things as the child tax credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit for 2005.\n\nIf you filed as “Head of Household” in 2004, you can do so for 2005 even if you are now living in someone else’s home because yours was damaged by the storm.\n\nTax Break for Those Providing Temporary Housing\n\nAnyone providing rent-free housing to Hurricane Katrina victims for at least 60 days will be able to take a tax deduction of $500 per person. The maximum deduction is $2,000.\n\nNo Tax on Debt Relief\n\nUnder the regular tax rules, if a creditor forgives your debt, this is considered income and the amount is subject to tax. Under this Act, if a debt — such as your mortgage — is cancelled as a result of the hurricane you will not have to pay income tax on this.\n\nLosses are Fully Deductible\n\nNormally, casualty losses are only deductible to the extent they exceed 10 percent of your adjusted gross income (AGI). In addition, the first $100 of this amount is disallowed. For instance, if your AGI were $80,000 and Katrina caused $50,000 in damages to your home, you’d only be able to deduct $41,900 ($50,000 – 8,000 - 100). However, Katrina victims will be allowed to deduct 100 percent of their hurricane-related losses.\n\nDeadline for Using Insurance Proceeds Extended\n\nIn order to avoid tax on insurance payments, the money must be used to replace damaged or lost property. Businesses have two years to reinvest the money; individuals have four. In both cases, the deadline is extended to five years provided the replacement property “is located within the disaster area.”\n\nExpanded Low-Interest Mortgages\n\nWhile states and local government entities can issue bonds to raise money for mortgages to lower-income homebuyers, this Act removes the requirement that the individual be a “first-time” home purchaser. It also permits loans of up to $150,000 for the purpose of repairing <existing> homes in the declared disaster area.\n\nPenalty-Free Retirement Plan Withdrawals\n\nKatrina victims who withdraw money from their company retirement plans or IRAs in order to make repairs or pay bills will not be hit with the usual 10 percent early withdrawal penalty even if they are under age 59 1/2. The maximum withdrawal is $100,000. In addition, these individuals can spread the income tax on these withdrawals over three years instead of having to pay the entire amount in the year of the distribution.\n\nIf your company retirement plan offers “hardship” loans, the maximum amount is temporarily increased from $50,000 to $100,000.\n\nTax Deadlines Extended\n\nIndividuals who were supposed to submit income, estate, or gift taxes will now have until Feb. 28, 2006 to do so. This includes filing tax returns and making estimated payments.\n\nIncentives for Charitable Contributions\n\nPeople who donate cash to a bona fide charity supporting Hurricane Katrina relief efforts will be able to deduct the entire amount. Normally, the amount you can deduct is limited to 50 percent of your AGI. This is further reduced because itemized deductions are phased out at higher income levels.\n\nThis measure also waives the 10 percent income limitation on corporate donations to charity.\n\nAs a result of this Act, individuals or corporations that make charitable contributions in cash will be able to deduct 100 percent of the amount, provided the donation is made before Jan. 1, 2006.\n\nTax Break for Using Your Personal Vehicle\n\nVolunteers who use their own car or truck in their charitable work can deduct 14 cents per mile — much less than the 48.5 cents per mile that the I.R.S. just approved for business use.\n\nThrough the end of this year, this Act raises the mileage deduction for Katrina aid workers to 34.2 cents per mile. It further states that if a volunteer is reimbursed for his mileage by the charity, he will not have to pay income tax on this amount.\n\nDonations of Food or Books\n\nSubject to certain limitations, C-corporations that donate food to charity can deduct the value. Under this measure, other types of business entities, such as S-corporations, partnerships and sole proprietors, can receive the same tax break.\n\nAn entity that donates educational materials to schools in the hurricane-affected area will be able to deduct this contribution.\n\nIn both cases, the food or books must be donated by the end of this year in order to qualify for this special tax break.\n\nTax Incentives for Employers\n\nThere are a number of tax breaks for companies that employ Katrina victims. For instance, the “Work Opportunity Tax Credit” (WOTC), which gives employers a tax credit for hiring individuals in certain target groups, has been expanded. It now includes anyone who lived in the area that is eligible for assistance under something called the “Stafford Act.”\n\nEmployers <within> the assistance area can claim the credit for the next two years. Companies outside the area are also eligible for the credit if they hire WOTC individuals from the declared disaster area before the end of this year.\n\nSmall Business Tax Credit\n\nCompanies in the Katrina disaster area with 200 or fewer employees are eligible for a tax credit of up to $2,400 for each employee they keep on the payroll. This is available even if the employee is working at another facility.\n\nLong-Term Relief Package to Come\n\nAs it did for New York City following the 9/11 Terrorist Attacks, Congress is expected to pass additional, longer-lasting tax breaks to help New Orleans and the rest of the declared Katrina disaster area recover.\n\nIf you have a question for Gail Buckner and the Your $ Matters column, send them to: moneymatters@foxnews.com , along with your name and phone number.\n\nGail Buckner and Foxnews.com regret that all letters cannot be addressed and that some might be combined in order to more completely address a topic.\n\nTo access Gail\'s past columns, simply use our new "Search" function: type in "Buckner" and you\'ll be able to get all Your $ Matters columns since April 2001.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are those of Ms. Buckner or the individual commentator.

"I\'ve spent my entire life taking care of patients. I have no history of doing anything other than good for my patients."\n\nIn a December 2005 interview, she told WBRZ-TV of Baton Rouge: "There were some patients there who were critically ill who, regardless of the storm, had the orders of do not resuscitate. In other words, if they died, to allow them to die naturally, and to not use heroic methods to resuscitate them."\n\n"We all did everything in our power to give the best treatment that we could to the patients in the hospital to make them comfortable," Pou said told the station.\n\nThe Orleans Parish grand jury had been investigating the allegations since March.\n\nCharges against the nurses, Lori Budo and Cheri Landry, were dropped after they were compelled to testify last month before the grand jury under legal guidelines that kept their testimony from being used against them.\n\nAssistant District Attorney Michael Morales had asked the grand jurors to return one charge of second-degree murder and nine of murder conspiracy against Pou.\n\nHe declined to comment after the judge read their decisions rejecting each charge.\n\nWhen the levees broke in New Orleans following the hurricane\'s landfall, 80 percent of the city flooded. The lower level Memorial Medical Center was under 10 feet of water, and electricity was out across the city. Inside the hospital, the temperature topped 100 degrees.\n\nAt least 34 people died at Memorial, many from dehydration during the four-day wait for rescuers to evacuate them. In the "60 Minutes" interview, Pou acknowledged administering drugs to relieve pain but stressed: "Anytime you provide pain medicine to anybody, there is a risk. But as I said, my role is to help them through the pain."\n\nOther doctors who were there described the situation as resembling a MASH unit during wartime rather than an urban American hospital.\n\n"It was stifling. We were hoisting patients floor to floor on the backs of strong young men. It was as bad as you can imagine," Dr. Gregory Vorhoff, who stayed throughout the storm and eventually hitched a ride on a boat to seek help, told The Associated Press after Pou was arrested.\n\nThe four patients Pou was accused of killing ranged in age from 61 to 90. Foti said all four would have survived if they hadn\'t been given morphine and midazolam hydrochloride.\n\nPou, whose specialty is eye, ear, nose and throat surgery, gave up her private practice after she was arrested and has been teaching at LSU medical school in Baton Rouge.\n\nThe families of people who died at Memorial in the days after Katrina can still sue Pou.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Julie Cullen, who sat in on the grand jury hearings, said investigators in her office still consider the deaths to be homicides.\n\nAsked what the grand jury\'s decision does for Pou\'s reputation, she said, "I guess that depends on who\'s considering her reputation."', 'title': 'Jury Refuses to Indict Doctor Accused of Killing Patients During Hurricane Katrina', 'url': 'http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/07/24/jury-refuses-to-indict-doctor-accused-killing-patients-during-hurricane-katrina.html', 'keywords': ['told', 'grand', 'medical', 'katrina', 'indict', 'patients', 'nurses', 'murder', 'pou', 'accused', 'ill', 'killing', 'jury', 'hurricane', 'doctor', 'refuses', 'memorial'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'A grand jury Tuesday declined to indict Dr. Anna Pou, the surgeon accused of killing four seriously ill patients in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.\n"I did not murder those patients," Pou told CBS\' "60 Minutes" last fall.\nThe lower level Memorial Medical Center was under 10 feet of water, and electricity was out across the city.\nThe four patients Pou was accused of killing ranged in age from 61 to 90.\nAssistant Attorney General Julie Cullen, who sat in on the grand jury hearings, said investigators in her office still consider the deaths to be homicides.', 'date': 1185235200}, {'text': 'If anything, well-intentioned officials magnified the effect by repeatedly lacing evacuation pleas with reminders of the death toll and devastation in New Orleans.\n\n"Don\'t follow the example of New Orleans," Mayor White pleaded on Wednesday.\n\nAs a result, though, state and local disaster officials struggled with problems never envisioned in any evacuation plan, 100-mile-long traffic jams, dehydrated babies in stifling cars and hundreds of motorists who simply ran out of gasoline trying to flee on choked roads.\n\nIn some cases, government improvised successfully. State employees, for example, delivered free gasoline to thousands of stranded motorists. The Houston bus system, with help from hundreds of volunteers, distributed 45,000 bottles of water to motorists.\n\nBut there were also numerous examples of a sluggish response.\n\nAfter Mayor White ordered mandatory evacuations, it took nearly 22 hours for officials to order that all lanes of Interstate 45, the city\'s main evacuation route, be used for traffic leaving Houston. It took an additional five hours for state transportation officials to execute the order.\n\nIn the case of U.S. 290, another major evacuation route, county officials said there were not enough law enforcement officials available to close feeder streets and safely manage one-way traffic.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the traffic problems contributed to the bus explosion outside Dallas early Friday morning that killed at least 24 elderly evacuees from an assisted-living center in Houston. The bus had taken more than 14 hours to make what is usually a five-hour trip.\n\nJudge Robert Eckels, the highest elected official in Harris County, defended the overall evacuation effort but acknowledged that officials did too little to prepare residents for huge traffic problems.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you\'re not a robot by clicking the box.

They could be 20 hours on the road. \'Don\'t get up here unless you have a full tank of gas.\' We did not do a good enough job of telling people that you get on the road, it may take 20 hours."\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA spokesman for the State Transportation Department, Mike Cox, offered a different explanation for the preparations. No one could have predicted, Mr. Cox said, how many Texans would be so seriously frightened by Hurricane Katrina.\n\n"Not one of our 15,000 employees is a psychologist," he said.\n\nIn defending the response, Mr. Cox stressed the bottom line that despite nightmarish delays, millions of Texans made it to safety.\n\n"This was, as best we can tell, probably the largest evacuation in American history," he said.\n\nIndeed, traffic problems eased noticeably throughout the state on Friday. Some motorists simply gave up, turned around and returned home. At the same time, state and local officials tried to tamp down the evacuation, emphasizing that residents should hunker down and ride out the storm if they lived on high ground.\n\nJust as Hurricane Katrina prompted a re-examination of planning in Louisiana and Mississippi, Hurricane Rita is likely to focus attention on planning here.\n\nWhy didn\'t Texas plan for an evacuation of this magnitude?\n\nGreg Evans, a disaster planning expert who directs the Institute for BioSecurity at the St. Louis University School of Public Health, said state disaster officials too often failed to plan for the worst.\n\n"People just like to believe things aren\'t going to be as bad as they are going to be," Dr. Evans said. "Their plans assume that 1.5million people will evacuate when the reality is that 2.5million people are evacuating.\n\n"All of a sudden, highways are jammed, people are running out of gas. All these things just spiral."\n\nIn September 2004, Gov. Rick Perry ordered the state\'s Office of Homeland Security to evaluate evacuation plans. The review, delivered in March, identified weaknesses, particularly in the "Houston-Galveston Evacuation Area."\n\nThe weaknesses included evacuation routes not wide enough to "handle large-scale movements of evacuees," routes that were too low and flood-prone, radio systems that cannot communicate with one another and inadequate monitoring of congestion.\n\nThe report made 18 recommendations. State officials said few had put been put into effect.\n\nOne recommendation was to install traffic counters on evacuation routes to monitor the heaviest traffic flows.

"Anything above that, all bets are off," said Al Naomi, a senior project manager in the corps\'s New Orleans district.\n\nBut federal meteorologists say that New Orleans did not get the full brunt of the storm, because its strongest winds passed dozens of miles east of the city. While a formal analysis of the storm\'s strength and surges will take months, the National Hurricane Center said the sustained winds over Lake Pontchartrain reached only 95 miles per hour, while Category 3 storms are defined by sustained winds of 111 to 130 m.p.h.\n\nThis raises a series of questions about how the walls that failed were designed and constructed, as well as whether the soil in some spots was too weak to hold them. Investigations by federal engineers and outside experts are just now beginning.\n\nOne factor could be height, said Robert G. Bea, a former corps engineer and professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who is part of a National Science Foundation inquiry into the flood controls failures. The higher the wall, Professor Bea said, the greater the risk it could tip under the ever greater pressure of rising waters.\n\nThe 2000 edition of the Army Corps of Engineers manual "Design and Construction of Levees" says that the height of flood walls built on levees is an important factor in their ability to withstand a flood. For that reason, the manual says walls like those used in New Orleans "rarely exceed" seven feet. But on two of the three canals where breaks occurred -- the 17th Street and London Avenue canals -- the concrete sections rise 11 feet above the dirt berms.\n\nEach wall resembles a row of teeth set in a jaw. Individual slabs are anchored to a continuous steel sheet buried in the dirt, giving the wall its strength. Above a short foundation, the slabs are linked only by rubbery gaskets that allow the concrete to expand and contract without cracking.\n\nHassan S. Mashriqui, an engineering professor at Louisiana State University and an expert on storm surges, said the segmented nature of the walls could be an additional problem, since any weak point could cause a catastrophic failure.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n"Since they\'re not tied together you get a little bit of a gap and that\'s what water needs to make it fail," Dr. Mashriqui said.\n\nOther questions surround the walls\' design, known as an "I-wall" for its slim cross section that fits easily into densely developed areas.\n\nThe corps manual for flood control construction suggests a different design for walls higher than seven feet -- walls shaped like an inverted T, with the horizontal section buried in the dirt for extra stability.\n\nBut that option was never considered, corps engineers said, because "T walls" were more expensive, required a broad base of dense soil for support and were not necessarily stronger.\n\nThe corps and local levee authorities also never tested whether the chosen I-wall design could survive if water flowed over the top and cascaded onto dirt embankments below.\n\nCorps officials said they were proscribed from considering stronger wall designs for the canals both by the tight quarters and by federal law, which requires that they seek and study only the level of flood control authorized by Congress.\n\n"Our hands are tied as to looking at higher-level events," Mr. Naomi said.\n\nMr. Naomi said that the recommendations in the flood control engineering manual were "general guidance," and that conditions at a particular site could justify deviations.\n\nHe defended the walls, saying: "The flood walls have functioned over the years very successfully and without incident. The design works. It has worked in other locales. And will likely continue to be used as long as you do not subject it to pressures that it was not designed to handle."\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe broken walls, which were long seen as a second choice to earthen levees, are testament to 40 years of fiscal and political compromises made by elected officials, from local levee boards to Congress and several presidential administrations, as they balanced costs and environmental concerns with the need to protect a city that lies largely below sea level and is still subsiding.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you\'re not a robot by clicking the box.

"We would not have this massive loss of life and destruction."\n\nOn Tuesday, streams of dump trucks hurriedly dumped loads of gravel into the breaches in New Orleans\'s flood defenses, in case Hurricane Rita shifts toward here later this week.\n\nIn the wake of Hurricane Katrina, a surge from Lake Pontchartrain poured into the main parts of the city through breaks on the walls lining the 17th Street and London Avenue canals, which normally carry runoff pumped out of the city into the lake. A separate surge from the Gulf of Mexico overwhelmed the walls along the Industrial Canal, inundating the Lower Ninth Ward. Officials say that break may have been caused by a barge that broke loose from its moorings.\n\nWhen the hurricane hit, the only earthen levees that failed in a way that produced substantial flooding were on the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, a man-made ship canal east of the city. These levees, which were not as high as those on the river or Lake Pontchartrain, let in the floodwaters that ravaged eastern New Orleans and St. Bernard Parish.\n\nA surge from Lake Pontchartrain was the catastrophic situation that the corps had been guarding against since Hurricane Betsy 40 years ago. Initially, the corps wanted to build a giant barrier to keep water from the Gulf of Mexico from reaching Lake Pontchartrain and flooding the canals.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat project was delayed by lawsuits from environmental groups that contended the corps had failed to study ecological effects. By the late 1970\'s, the corps abandoned that approach and began raising levees along the lake and the Mississippi and adding flood walls on the canals.\n\nIn the mid-1990\'s, engineering professors at Louisiana State began publicizing computer models that showed how a Category 5 storm could kill tens of thousands of people and flood the French Quarter. Corps officials in Louisiana pushed local officials to help seek more money from Congress, both to finish existing upgrades and to start bolstering the city against bigger threats.\n\nJoseph Suhayda, who was one of the Louisiana State professors, said corps officials privately urged him to "raise the consciousness" about the dire threats.\n\nBut upgrading the flood control system never became a major priority for corps officials in Washington, local and federal officials say.\n\nCorps veterans said it was not surprising that federal engineers did not issue more vocal warnings.\n\n"I don\'t think it was culturally in the system for the corps to say \'this is crazy,"\' said William F. Marcuson III, the former director of the Waterways Experiment Station for the corps in Vicksburg, Miss., and president-elect of the American Society of Civil Engineers.\n\n"The corps works for Congress," Mr. Marcuson said, "and when the boss says design for a Category 3 storm, culturally the corps is not going to go back and say this is wrong."\n\nInvestigations into how the walls failed are just now beginning. Col. Richard Wagenaar, commander of the corps district in New Orleans, said the soil behind the flood walls could have been weakened after they were topped by the storm surge, or the walls could have simply given way as the water -- and the pressure -- mounted against them.\n\nIndeed, as several engineers said, while a dirt levee of similar height might eventually be topped as well, and possibly eroded, only the walls were vulnerable to a sudden collapse.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe determination of how the walls fell will bear on how officials decide to remake the flood control system.\n\nMax Hearn, executive director of the Orleans Levee District, said that if the federal government was now ready to pay for Category 5 protection, it seemed unlikely that the flood wall system could be upgraded to that level.\n\nBut Mr. Hearn said the only answer might be the construction of flood gates designed to limit a hurricane surge in Lake Pontchartrain -- the same idea that was considered and dropped in the 1970\'s.', 'title': 'Design Shortcomings Seen in New Orleans Flood Walls', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/21/us/nationalspecial/design-shortcomings-seen-in-new-orleans-flood-walls.html', 'keywords': ['shortcomings', 'design', 'orleans', 'corps', 'flood', 'seen', 'storm', 'lake', 'federal', 'walls', 'pontchartrain', 'hurricane', 'officials'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'The 2000 edition of the Army Corps of Engineers manual "Design and Construction of Levees" says that the height of flood walls built on levees is an important factor in their ability to withstand a flood.\nHe defended the walls, saying: "The flood walls have functioned over the years very successfully and without incident.\nsaid Ms. Hedge-Morrell, whose district between downtown and the lakefront was covered with 10 feet of water from the breaks of flood walls.\nJoseph Suhayda, who was one of the Louisiana State professors, said corps officials privately urged him to "raise the consciousness" about the dire threats.\nBut upgrading the flood control system never became a major priority for corps officials in Washington, local and federal officials say.', 'date': 1127260800}, {'text': 'New Orleans police say they have never seen so much peace and quiet on the city\'s streets.\n\n"We haven\'t seen a robbery since the beginning of August," said Lt.

Allstate believes it acted in good faith throughout the entire claims process with the Weiss family," she said.\n\nThe jury found Allstate — which claimed most of the damage was due to storm surge, an event not covered in its policy — did not pay Robert Weiss enough money to cover wind damage to his home. The verdict included a $1.5 million penalty for the company\'s failure to pay the claim quickly enough.\n\n"Our intention was to get what we were owed and to send a message that we would not be intimidated," Weiss said after the verdict was read.\n\nAllstate lawyer Judy Barrasso said in closing arguments that Katrina\'s winds were not strong enough to do the damage. She said Weiss already had received more than $400,000 in insurance payments\n\nincluding $350,000 in federal flood insurance.\n\n"Have you really seen any proof that the damages were in the million-dollar range?" Barrasso asked the jury.\n\nThe lawyer for the Weiss, whose home was in the Slidell area on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain, told the jury in closing arguments that the house was too high above sea level to have been destroyed by Katrina\'s storm surge. The eye of Katrina passed just east of Slidell on the morning of Aug. 29, 2005.\n\nThe lawsuit against Northbrook, Ill.-based Allstate was the second Katrina damage claim to come to federal trial in New Orleans. Hundreds of similar disputes are pending in Louisiana and Mississippi.\n\nIn addition to federal flood insurance, Weiss had an Allstate homeowner policy with limits of $343,000 for the dwelling and $240,100 for personal property.\n\nThe company, blaming the majority of damage on Katrina\'s storm surge, paid $29,483 for structural damage and $14,787 for additional living expenses.\n\nRichard Trahant, lawyer for Weiss, argued the house was 17 feet above sea level and that engineering data suggested only 14 feet of surge hit the area. "It never reached the bottom of the house," he said.\n\nAllstate\'s Barrasso said sustained winds at the house did not exceed 100 mph.\n\n"There was plenty of evidence to show the winds were not strong enough to topple this house and the storm surge was," she said.\n\nJim Neva, a surveyor and engineer who inspected the house for Allstate, initially told Robert Weiss, who is listed as the policy holder, and his wife, Merryl, that wind may have destroyed the home before the surge of water washed away its remnants.\n\nHe later backed off that conclusion, and deferred to engineering consultant Craig Rogers of Rimkus Consulting Group. Rogers, who wrote the final report on the home for Allstate, convinced Neva that storm surge demolished the house.\n\nRogers said he didn\'t personally inspect the property until after he wrote the report. He said he based his conclusions in part on evidence gathered by other Rimkus engineers — a practice he described as common. But Trahant questioned the move.\n\n"Why did Allstate elect to rely on the one engineer who never set foot on the property until long after he stamped his report?" Trahant said in closing arguments.\n\nJeffrey Mika, 30, foreman of the 8-person jury, said the jury was persuaded by Allstate\'s decision to rely on the assessment by Rogers, who did not personally visit the site.\n\n"We didn\'t feel that Allstate acted in good faith to settle this claim," Mika said.\n\nAllstate also had claimed the Weisses misrepresented part of the claim.\n\nThe company said the couple asked Allstate to pay for a boathouse that was not covered by their policy. The company argued a policyholder who misrepresents even part of a claim voids all coverage.\n\n"I think the jury saw right through it," Trahant said of the misrepresentation defense after the verdict was read.

But now the emphasis has shifted to recovering bodies before crucial evidence is lost. So far, 279 have been confirmed dead in Louisiana and 211 in Mississippi.\n\n“The key is to get the bodies into refrigeration so they can halt the decomposition,” says Lawrence Kobilinsky, a forensic scientist at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, US, who says bacteria, rats and even alligators are now preying on the bodies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe US Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team (DMORT) is retrieving bodies, along with any jewellery and documents found nearby, and putting them in refrigerated trucks.\n\nTsunami comparisons\n\nAt the mortuary or coroners office, DMORT takes digital dental X-rays, photographs, fingerprints and a DNA sample. Then a team matches them with pre-existing data – dental records, fingerprints on police files or found around the house – and DNA, either from items the individual owned, or from close blood relatives.\n\nBut the process is “tremendously difficult”, say several forensic scientists. “The level of mass fatality, the mass disruption and displacement of people, the intense heat and lots of water. These are the things that caused the problems in Thailand following the tsunami,” says Sue Black, a forensic anthropologist at the University of Dundee, UK, who identified bodies in Thailand. These factors “are all present in New Orleans”.\n\nBut although lessons in body identification have been learned from the tsunami in 2004 and the collapse of the World Trade Center in 2001, Hurricane Katrina presents a unique set of problems.\n\nBloated bodies\n\nThe tsunami washed in and then washed out, while the water from the hurricane has stayed, allowing bodies to putrefy, says Wickenheiser. Warm water accelerates the rate that bacteria feed on soft tissue, causing skin to fall away in sheets, and releasing gases that bloat the body. Age and race become difficult to determine, faces are unrecognisable, tattoos are lost and it becomes impossible to take fingerprints.\n\nIn Asia, the vast majority of people were eventually identified by their dental records, which last longer than fingerprints or face recognition. But this may not be possible in New Orleans, where computers containing dental records have been swept away and the dentists themselves may have fled.\n\nWickenheiser believes that much of the identification process will come down to DNA, which is much more time-consuming and expensive than other methods, but which can be carried out from bone, long after bodies have decayed.\n\nNuclear DNA is ideal, and the best for identifying the individual from their brothers’ or sisters’ DNA. But toothbrushes or hairbrushes necessary for providing a home-specific DNA sample – which were available in the case of World Trade Center attacks, since those victims’ homes were not involved in the tragedy – were in many cases swept away along with the hurricane. The next best thing is samples from next-of-kin relatives, such as parents, siblings and children, but they too may have been displaced.\n\nMurder and rape\n\nThe other option is mitochondrial DNA, which is found in much larger amounts in cells and has a ring structure more resistant to decay. Extracted from bone, this was used in Bosnia to identify victims of war crimes. Because it is passed down from mother to child, even cousins could be used to identify one another, but it is also impossible to tell siblings apart from their mothers or children using this method.\n\nAnother confusing and unique factor could be that there will also be bodies recovered of people who did not drown but were killed in the crime wave that followed the hurricane.\n\n“When the planes hit the twin towers, the probability that someone was being raped or murdered at the same time was very low,” says Wickenheiser. “We are collecting not just information that leads to identity, but potential forensic evidence as well.”', 'title': 'New Orleans will struggle to identify its dead', 'url': 'https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7992-new-orleans-will-struggle-to-identify-its-dead/', 'keywords': ['water', 'struggle', 'dental', 'orleans', 'bodies', 'identify', 'forensic', 'victims', 'tsunami', 'wickenheiser', 'dna', 'hurricane', 'dead', 'records'], 'tags': {'Earth', 'Health', 'News'}, 'summary': 'So far, 279 have been confirmed dead in Louisiana and 211 in Mississippi.\nTsunami comparisonsAt the mortuary or coroners office, DMORT takes digital dental X-rays, photographs, fingerprints and a DNA sample.\nIn Asia, the vast majority of people were eventually identified by their dental records, which last longer than fingerprints or face recognition.\nBut this may not be possible in New Orleans, where computers containing dental records have been swept away and the dentists themselves may have fled.\nExtracted from bone, this was used in Bosnia to identify victims of war crimes.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'A report that recommends steps to reduce hurricane damage in New Orleans was released today by an expert engineering panel of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).\n\nThe 84-page report, “The New Orleans Hurricane Protection System: What Went Wrong and Why,” targets the public and policymakers, and complements and synthesizes the thousands of pages released so far by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during their post-Katrina investigation.\n\nDr. Robert Gilbert, the risk expert on the ASCE panel and a civil engineering professor at The University of Texas at Austin, noted that their risk analysis confirms the vulnerable nature of the city’s hurricane protection system. In the report, the panel estimated that despite the levees and floodwalls, New Orleans residents’ pre-Katrina risk was at a 1,000-fold higher rate than considered minimally acceptable for a major U.S. dam.\n\n“A thousand people died in New Orleans, and the system failed once in 40 years,” said the international risk assessment expert. “That’s way off the chart of acceptable risk if you compare the system to major U.S. dams, which have governmental oversight and must meet federal safety guidelines.”\n\nDetermining the factors that directly or indirectly led to this high risk was a major goal of the ASCE panel as an essential step to help the city make informed decisions about the future.\n\n“Given the high risk, some very significant decisions need to be made about how New Orleans is going to be redeveloped and function in the future,” Gilbert said. “The risk of flooding should influence everything from how people are evacuated to where and how houses are re-built and land is re-developed. Building houses on ground that is 5 to 10 feet below sea level and assuming they will never get wet is nonsensical.”\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is expected in June to release its assessment of the inherent risk of the 350-mile, New Orleans’ hurricane protection system.\n\nAs part of assessing the risk and making recommendations for future improvements, the panel considered factors that included\n\n- how inconsistencies in the features of the levees and floodwalls – including their varying heights and construction from erodible materials – resulted from their piecemeal development and disjointed oversight, and how this fed into the failure at 50 locations along the system during Hurricane Katrina;\n\n- how the hurricane protection system was under-designed to handle a major storm surge produced by hurricane winds that would reach New Orleans. No one had ever estimated the height of the surge likely to reach different points of the levee system using the standard benchmark – a major hurricane that would hit an average of every 100 years.\n\nDespite the importance of engineering improvements, Gilbert cautioned that fortification steps alone aren’t enough.\n\n“It isn’t just about improving the reliability of the levees and making them taller,” he said. “Spending federal money towards developing a way to evacuate people effectively is crucial, and very little emphasis has been put on this or on determining how to rebuild the city in a way that will keep people and property safe.”\n\nRelying only on levees isn’t the answer, Gilbert said, because upgrading them is expensive, and it’s difficult to anticipate the magnitude of future storms, which can impact a small portion of a levee system and have catastrophic consequences. He also noted that higher levees can create greater danger because of the higher wall of water that is released if they fail.\n\n“I’m hopeful that getting this report out into the public forum about all these challenges will help motivate the people involved in making tough decisions about the future of New Orleans to start doing so.”', 'title': 'New Orleans Levee: Report Details What Went Wrong And Why In Hurricane Katrina', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/06/070604155742.htm', 'keywords': ['system', 'protection', 'katrina', 'wrong', 'orleans', 'major', 'risk', 'levees', 'panel', 'went', 'levee', 'details', 'hurricane', 'gilbert', 'report'], 'tags': {'Tsunamis', 'Hurricanes and Cyclones', 'Earthquakes', 'Natural Disasters', 'Landslides', 'Severe Weather', 'Environmental Policy', 'Floods'}, 'summary': 'A report that recommends steps to reduce hurricane damage in New Orleans was released today by an expert engineering panel of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).\nThe 84-page report, “The New Orleans Hurricane Protection System: What Went Wrong and Why,” targets the public and policymakers, and complements and synthesizes the thousands of pages released so far by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during their post-Katrina investigation.\nIn the report, the panel estimated that despite the levees and floodwalls, New Orleans residents’ pre-Katrina risk was at a 1,000-fold higher rate than considered minimally acceptable for a major U.S. dam.\n“A thousand people died in New Orleans, and the system failed once in 40 years,” said the international risk assessment expert.\nNo one had ever estimated the height of the surge likely to reach different points of the levee system using the standard benchmark – a major hurricane that would hit an average of every 100 years.', 'date': 1181174400}, {'text': 'An Algiers man hailed by some as a hero for commandeering a school bus the day after Hurricane Katrina to take 60 stranded residents to safety in Houston has been arrested on drug charges where his bus journey began: the Fischer public housing complex.\n\nJabar Gibson, 20, who garnered a movie deal and national attention as the renegade bus driver, was booked Friday with possession with intent to distribute heroin after police stopped his rental car for allegedly driving erratically, New Orleans police said.\n\nGibson and another man, Gary Burnett, were traveling near the public housing complex about 12:30 p.m. when they veered slightly and nearly struck the police cruiser of officers Michael Pierce and Cory McKain, Pierce said.\n\nThe officers pursued the men\'s car. the suspects stopped it and ran toward the apartment complex, tossing what police said were drugs on the ground.

Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts (Bush\'s previous partner on bipartisan Medicare and education reform), but perhaps the Democrats\' newest political sensation, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama.\n\nThat unexpected relationship between the hobbled president and a rising young star (who is also a former inner city social worker and law professor) could yield innovative policy gains for the powerless and political dividends for both men.\n\nExecutives in politics\n\nAcross the country, Katrina also is likely to dramatically increase the number of business executives who run for and win major political office.\n\nIndeed, the problems in New Orleans -- from the failure to improve the levees to poor management of an emergency situation -- are likely to make clean and competent government one of the buzz phrases of 2006 elections.\n\nAttractive outsiders with a credible background in managing complex businesses and at least the perception of being a reformer are likely to do exceptionally well, not just in gubernatorial and mayoral races, but in legislative races as well.\n\nAnd while the memory of Katrina will likely lead to a significant increase in Mike Bloomberg-type business candidates, some public officials with highly credible management expertise also will benefit in 2006 and beyond. Did someone say Rudy Giuliani in 2008?\n\nImpact on African-American politics\n\nOn a more specific but perhaps less visible level, Katrina also is likely to significantly impact African-American politics over the next decade.\n\nWhile recent polls show a significant split in racial perception of the government\'s response, what the polls do not register is the level of intensity that many African-Americans felt as they watched the floating bodies, read former First Lady Barbara Bush\'s comments about the evacuees, and saw the notorious contrasting looting photos (one white couple, one black man).\n\nIndeed, it is likely that Katrina will prove to be a "Rodney King moment" for many African-Americans -- or an "Emmett Till moment" for those who can remember that earlier scandal of the 1950s.\n\nPut simply, Katrina underscored the deepest fear of many African-Americans -- that no matter what gains they make or what America\'s leaders say, when the rubber meets the road they are not and will not be considered equally important humans in the eyes of the U.S. government.\n\nThus, in 2006 and beyond, while it probably will not be heavily invoked in mainstream television commercials, the mere mention of "Katrina" or the looting photos or Barbara Bush\'s comments in African-American churches or at African-American rallies is likely to send a red-hot signal to black voters that they must register and vote in large numbers, or risk getting sub-par treatment even when the world is watching.\n\nIf such massive black mobilization results from this controversial and tragic event, it could be analogous to the female mobilization that dramatically changed the U.S. Senate following the Anita Hill/Clarence Thomas hearings in 1991, or the Latino mobilization in California following immigration battles in the mid-90s that turned that once swing state into the bluest of blue republics.\n\nAppointing key public officials\n\nFinally, like major natural disasters before, including the Galveston flood of 1900, Katrina is likely to change how we appoint a variety of key public officials.\n\nWhile political cronyism will never go away completely (or perhaps even significantly), the "Michael Brown lesson" is likely to play out not only at FEMA, but in the appointment of wide variety of sensitive emergency posts.\n\nIn particular, from state emergency directors to ambassadors in potentially volatile countries, more major appointments (at least in the short term) are likely to be reserved for the truly qualified.\n\nMoreover, over the next year, many of those who currently hold appointment but who could become a Michael Brown-type liability if exposed, will likely quietly resign or be replaced.\n\nSo while the French Quarter may reopen very soon, Hurricane Katrina\'s political winds are likely to be felt for years to come.', 'title': 'A very political hurricane', 'url': 'http://edition.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/09/15/political.hurricane/index.html', 'keywords': ['political', 'truly', 'likely', 'katrina', 'major', '2006', 'africanamerican', 'emergency', 'bushs', 'hurricane', 'dramatically'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': "A very political hurricaneKatrina is dramatically changing U.S. politics.\nBy Carlos WatsonCNNPALO ALTO, California -- As evidenced by President Bush's speech Thursday, Hurricane Katrina already is dramatically changing U.S. politics.\nHelping the chronically poorIn the aftermath of Katrina, major and more comprehensive approaches to helping the chronically poor -- both conservative and liberal solutions -- may also emerge.\nExecutives in politicsAcross the country, Katrina also is likely to dramatically increase the number of business executives who run for and win major political office.\nSo while the French Quarter may reopen very soon, Hurricane Katrina's political winds are likely to be felt for years to come.", 'date': None}]
