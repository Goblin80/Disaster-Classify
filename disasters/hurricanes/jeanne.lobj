[{'text': 'Four dead as Jeanne moves through Florida\n\nAlmost 2 million customers without electricity in state\n\n\n\n\n\nMELBOURNE, Florida (CNN) -- Hurricane Jeanne, downgraded Sunday to a tropical storm, is responsible for the deaths of at least four people in Florida, officials said.\n\nA man and woman drowned in an SUV that left the road Saturday night, but officials could not recover the bodies until Sunday morning because of storm conditions, a spokesman for the Florida Highway Patrol said.\n\nA 15-year-old boy was killed by a falling tree along the St. Johns River on Sunday afternoon, a spokeswoman for the Clay County Sheriff\'s Department said. She said a friend of the boy was hurt but that the injuries aren\'t life-threatening.\n\nAlso Sunday, a couple discovered a pickup in a deep drainage ditch in Palm Bay, south of Melbourne. The occupant had drowned, police spokesman Barney Weiss said.\n\nWeiss said the man apparently drove into the flooded ditch by mistake.\n\nThe deaths were the first in the United States reported as a result of Jeanne, which made landfall with 120 mph winds just before midnight Saturday near the southern end of Hutchinson Island, five miles southeast of Stuart.\n\nIn that hard-hit town, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush told residents Sunday that support would be there for them.\n\n"This time our state will not only survive, it will rebound," he said. "We will be stronger and better because of what we\'ve gone through."\n\nThe governor said the heaviest damage was to the Treasure Coast counties of Martin, St. Lucie and Indian River. He said he has asked the federal government for aid.\n\nPresident Bush declared the state a major disaster area, making way for additional funds to supplement its recovery efforts.\n\nRisk Management Solutions, a catastrophe-modeling firm that works for the insurance industry, estimated Sunday that Jeanne could cause between $4 billion and $8 billion in insured losses in the United States. (Full story)\n\nDave Bruns, a spokesman for the state Division of Emergency Management in Tallahassee, said emergency officials were ready to move in with supplies as soon as conditions allow.\n\nAt 11 p.m., Jeanne was 35 miles west-northwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. Maximum sustained winds were near 50 mph, and the storm was moving north near 14 mph.\n\nThe center said the storm is expected to turn to the north, then the northeast as it makes its way around a high-pressure system in the Southeast. The three-day forecast track issued by the center predicted Jeanne will weaken as it moves through central Georgia and the Carolinas before heading out into the Atlantic Ocean on Tuesday night or Wednesday morning.\n\nJeanne was the first major hurricane to make landfall north of West Palm Beach and south of the Savannah River for as long as records have been kept.\n\nJoe Baird, emergency management director for Indian River County, said 100 mph gusts slammed Vero Beach well after the storm passed.\n\n"We think we have severe damage like we\'ve never had before," he said. "We have not been able to respond to calls due to high winds. With all the water we\'ve had, we assume we\'re going to have severe flooding."\n\nPower outages\n\nFlorida Power and Light, the state\'s largest power utility, said about 1.1 million of its customers were without power as of 5 p.m. Sunday. The company said it had already restored electricity to nearly 470,000 homes.\n\nProgress Energy Florida, which serves central and northwest Florida, reported 595,000 customers without power at 3 p.m.\n\nTampa Electric reported 274,000 customers without power as of 4 p.m., according to the company\'s Web site.\n\nPower officials urged residents to stay indoors and away from downed power lines until crews can get to the affected areas.\n\n\'It just doesn\'t stop\'\n\nStuart Mayor Jeff Krauskopf, hunkered down in his home, ventured out with other city workers during the two hours of calm as the eye passed directly over his town.\n\nKrauskopf said Stuart is suffering from hurricane fatigue.\n\n"It just doesn\'t stop," he said. "It\'s like that song, Frances to the left of me, Ivan to the right, and Jeanne, I\'m stuck in the middle with you.\n\n"The howling is hellish," he added.\n\nStuart\'s Martin Memorial Hospital North lost half its roof, but the 50 patients inside were taken to a safe area and were not hurt, Krauskopf said. The hospital also was damaged from Hurricane Frances, and had completed interim repairs.\n\nThe two bridges to Hutchinson Island, the location of Jeanne\'s initial landfall, are impassable, making it impossible to know how the estimated 200 residents who refused to evacuate fared in the storm, he said.\n\nNational Guard aircraft have been requested for an aerial assessment of the island, Martin County spokesman Jeff Alter said.\n\nJeanne\'s worst damage was inflicted in Haiti, where more than 1,300 people are dead and a large number are still missing.

At least six people died in the storm, which was a cruel rerun for many still trying to recover from earlier hurricanes.

More than 1.1 million homes and businesses were without power. "The last three weeks have been horrific," said Joe Stawara, owner of a Vero Beach mobile home park where about half the 232 trailers were damaged.

[Reuters]\n\nUntil this weekend, no state had suffered a four-hurricane pounding in one season since Texas in 1886. And the hurricane season still has two months to go. Rain blew sideways in wind that reached 120 mph when Hurricane Jeanne\'s eye hit land late Saturday night; by 8 p.m. EDT Sunday it had weakened to a tropical storm with sustained wind near 55 mph.\n\nRoofs are damaged after Hurricane Jeanne hit Vero Beach, Florida September 26, 2004. [Reuters]\n\nAt least a foot of water rushed through some streets in Vero Beach, where a mattress floated through one neighborhood. US President Bush declared a major disaster area in Florida. The hurricanes have prompted the largest relief effort in the Federal Emergency Management Agency\'s history, eclipsing responses for the 1994 earthquake in Northridge, Calif., and the 2001 terrorist attacks, director Michael Brown said. "You\'re going to have some areas that have been hit once, twice and sometimes maybe three times," Brown said. "That\'s very frustrating, I know, for those who live in those communities." Frances was larger, while Charley and Ivan were more powerful. But Jeanne was bad enough, once again sending the Sunshine State into a state of emergency. Gov. Jeb Bush sought to reassure weary Floridians. "This will become a memory," he said. "This does come to an end, and when it does we can probably use the term \'normal\' again." Seawater submerged the bottom floor of condominiums on Hutchinson Island, where Josh Lumberson rode out the storm. The parking lot was under 5 feet of sand and water, and sand rose to the kitchen cabinets inside first-floor condos. The ocean, once 75 yards away, lapped at the foundation. "It sounded like the whole building was coming down," Lumberson said. "You could hear every metal screw coming out of the walls." As the wind subsided, the clang of metal siding could still be heard on the barrier island. Jeanne made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of up to 120 mph just before midnight Saturday at Hutchinson Island, 35 miles north of West Palm Beach. Frances struck in almost the same spot. Once inland, Jeanne\'s 400-mile diameter system trudged across the state, passing northeast of Tampa. It then headed toward the Panhandle, which was still recovering from Ivan. Max Mayfield, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami, described the similar paths of Jeanne and Frances as perhaps unprecedented. The toll from the latest storm extended as far north as Daytona Beach, where the famous beach was ravaged by erosion, and south to Miami, where one person was electrocuted after touching a downed power line. Two people died when the sport utility vehicle they were driving plunged into a lake beside the Sawgrass Expressway south of Boca Raton. In Clay County southwest of Jacksonville, a 15-year-old boy died after being pinned by a falling tree Sunday. In Brevard County, a man was found dead in a ditch in Palm Bay in what police called an apparent drowning. In nearby Micco, a 60-year-old man was found dead after a hurricane party at a home. He was found lying in water after the house had flooded; police said the death may be alcohol-related or the man may have drowned. Jeanne\'s predecessors killed at least 70 people in Florida and caused billions of dollars in damage. In St. Lucie County north of West Palm Beach, police rescued five families when the hurricane\'s eye passed over late Saturday, including a wheelchair-bound couple in their 90s whose mobile home collapsed around them, emergency operations spokeswoman Linette Trabulsy said. In Rockledge, the Indian River overflowed its banks, lifting docks off their moorings carrying them into roads and yards. Single-engine planes flipped over at Palm Beach International Airport. At Cape Canaveral, the third hurricane to hit NASA\'s spaceport in just over a month blew out more panels and left more gaping holes in the massive shuttle assembly building. More than 3,000 National Guard troops were deployed to aid relief efforts. But some residents acknowledged it could have been worse. Peirce Braun assessed the mess from the front yard of his bungalow. "It\'s really not that bad," he said. "The worst thing in Florida is to be without the AC." Among the areas left without power were much of Palm Beach County, population 1.1 million, and ― for the second time in three weeks ― all of Vero Beach. With Jeanne dumping heavy rain, there was fear of flooding in the days to come from swollen rivers in east and central Florida, already saturated by two previous hurricanes. In Sanford, a city near Orlando surrounded by lakes and rivers, a foot of water flowed down a scenic road that parallels Lake Monroe, and three-foot waves broke over the seawall that separates the lake from the historic downtown area. State officials said 59,000 people, many with homes already damaged by Frances, rode out Jeanne in shelters. At least one family will remember Jeanne fondly. An Indiantown woman gave birth at her home during the hurricane with help from 911 operators who offered instructions. The woman and her newborn son were doing well after being transferred by fire rescue personnel to a hospital. By 8 p.m. EDT, Tropical Storm Jeanne was centered about 30 miles southwest of Gainesville, and was moving north-northwest near 13 mph. It was forecast to weaken into a tropical depression sometime Monday. Earlier, Jeanne tore across the Bahamas, leaving some neighborhoods under 6 feet of water. The storm caused flooding in Haiti that killed more than 1,500 people. Jeanne followed Charley, which struck Aug. 13 and devastated southwest Florida; Frances, which struck Labor Day weekend; and Ivan, which ravaged the western Panhandle when it made landfall in Alabama on Sept. 16. Before Jeanne, FEMA had received more than 600,000 requests for aid from hurricane victims in Florida and throughout the eastern United States and disbursed about $360 million, Brown said. FEMA already has delivered millions of gallons of water, bags of ice and ready-to-eat meals to storm victims.\n\n\n\nClose Today\'s Top News Top World News Experts suggest: Encourage megacities\n\nTaiwan people protest Chen\'s arms purchase\n\nExporters to enjoy less EU preference\n\n\n\nBush: Iran will not get nuclear weapon\n\nShanghai expecting third baby boom to hit\n\nPremier pushes for stronger Russian ties\n\nLatest hurricane kills six in Florida Pearl slaying suspect killed in Pakistan Bush: Iran will not get nuclear weapon Iraq commander accused of militant links Jeanne tears across Bahamas toward Florida DPRK missile site movements said continuing\n\nAdvertisement', 'title': 'Latest hurricane kills six in Florida', 'url': 'http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-09/27/content_377998.htm', 'keywords': ['state', 'power', 'jeanne', 'weeks', 'latest', 'kills', 'beach', 'florida', 'storm', 'hurricane', 'water', 'frances'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'NOAA satellite image taken at 1415 EDT September 26, 2004 shows Hurricane Jeanne as the once-powerful storm weakened to a tropical storm while inland in Florida.\nHurricane Jeanne peeled off roofs, snapped power lines and left large swaths of coastline knee-deep in water Sunday as it plowed through parts of Florida already scarred by Hurricane Frances three weeks ago.\nAn airplane sits upside-down at Martin County Airport in Stuart, Florida after Hurricane Jeanne battered the area September 26, 2004.\nRoofs are damaged after Hurricane Jeanne hit Vero Beach, Florida September 26, 2004.\nBy 8 p.m. EDT, Tropical Storm Jeanne was centered about 30 miles southwest of Gainesville, and was moving north-northwest near 13 mph.', 'date': 1096243200}, {'text': 'Haiti death toll passes 700 after storm\n\n(Agencies)\n\nUpdated: 2004-09-22 08:40\n\nThe death toll across Haiti from the weekend deluges brought by Tropical Storm Jeanne rose to more than 700 Tuesday, with about 600 of them in Gonaives, and officials said they expected to find more dead and estimated tens of thousands of people were homeless.\n\nThe northern Haitian city of Gonaives is seen flooded on September 19, 2004 after Hurricane Jeanne passed through.[Reuters]\n\n"We\'re going to start burying people in mass graves," said Toussaint Kongo-Doudou, a spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Haiti.

In addition, at least 51 were recovered in other areas.\n\nBut Deslorges said there were dozens more dead still unaccounted for, which would bring the toll past 700. "It appears many were swept away to the sea, there are bodies still buried in mud and rubble, or floating in water," he said.\n\nHe said relief workers were operating under "extremely difficult conditions: no electricity, all landline telephone service is cut, cell phones work very badly and then there\'s no power to recharge them."\n\nGonaives was blacked-out Tuesday night. Only a handful of buildings were lit and hotels packed with displaced people were in darkness because they had run out of fuel for generators.\n\nMore than 1,000 people were missing, said Raoul Elysee, head of the Haitian Red Cross, which was trying desperately to find doctors to help. The international aid group CARE said 85 of its 200 workers in Gonaives were unaccounted for.\n\n"It\'s really catastrophic. We\'re still discovering bodies," said Francoise Gruloos of the U.N. Children\'s Fund.\n\nThe aid group Food for the Poor said the main road north from Gonaives was made impassable by the storm ― it was unclear whether from mudslides or debris ― and there were fears that hundreds of possible flood victims may be out of reach.\n\nBrazilian and Jordanian troops in the U.N. peacekeeping mission sent to stabilize Haiti after rebels ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in February struggled to help the needy as aid workers ferried supplies of water and food to victims.\n\nCARE spokesman Rick Perera said the agency had about 660 tons of dry food in Gonaives, including corn-soy blend, dried lentils and cooking oil and was trying to set up distribution points.\n\nPolice said aid vehicles were being waylaid by mobs on the outskirts of Gonaives. One truck that made it to City Hall in the town center was swarmed by people who began throwing its load of bagged water into the crowd, setting off a melee. The driver finally sped off, bouncing people off the truck.\n\nAddressing the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, Haiti\'s interim president, Boniface Alexandre, pleaded for help.\n\n"In the face of this tragedy ... I appeal urgently for the solidarity of the international community so it may once again support the government in the framework of emergency assistance," he said.\n\nSeveral nations were sending aid including $1.8 million from the European Union and $1 million and rescue supplies from Venezuela. The U.S. Embassy announced $60,000 in immediate relief aid Monday, drawing criticism from Rep. Kendrick Meek, D-Fla., who called it "a drop in the bucket."\n\nFloods are particularly devastating in Haiti, the poorest country in the Americas, because it is almost completely deforested, leaving few roots to hold back rushing waters or mudslides.

"We have two primary purposes for doing a captive carry flight," said McAllister. "The first is to make sure that the X-43 and its booster rocket - two highly complex systems - are ready for flight. The second is to make sure we\'re well trained. It\'s a very big operation (and) we want to make sure that all those people and all those systems are ready to go." The X-43A is powered by a revolutionary air-breathing supersonic-combustion ramjet - or "scramjet" - engine. Scramjet engines could enable future hypersonic aircraft or space-access vehicles to either carry a greater payload or be smaller and lighter, since they would not have to carry large oxidizer tanks as present-day launch rockets do. If successful, the Mach 10 flight will break all speed records for an aircraft powered by an air-breathing engine. After a review of captive-carry flight data, project engineers are expected to set a tentative date for the final X-43A flight for early November. The X-43A project is part of the Hyper-X hypersonic research program led by NASA\'s Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate and operated jointly by NASA\'s Langley Research Center, Hampton, Va., and Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, Calif. The program aims to demonstrate air-breathing engine technologies that promise to increase payload capacity - or reduce vehicle size for the same payload - for future hypersonic aircraft and reusable space launch vehicles.\n\nAdditional coverage for subscribers:\n\nVIDEO: X-43A CAPTIVE CARRY FLIGHT TEST ON B-52 QT\n\nSUBSCRIBE NOW\n\n\n\n', 'title': 'X-43A captive carry rehearsal flight successful', 'url': 'https://spaceflightnow.com/news/n0409/28x43a/', 'keywords': ['sept', 'captive', 'rehearsal', 'x43a', 'space', 'center', 'fileplay', 'carry', 'flight', 'successful', 'research', 'aircraft'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'X-43A testNASA\'s X-43A research craft and its Pegasus rocket booster complete a captive carry test flight aboard a B-52 launch aircraft.\nX-43A captive carry rehearsal flight successfulNASA-DFRC NEWS RELEASEPosted: September 28, 2004NASA aeronautics researchers are looking forward to flying the X-43A research aircraft at speeds up to 10 times the speed of sound later this fall, following a successful "captive carry" dress rehearsal flight from NASA\'s Dryden Flight Research Center Sept. 27.Credit: NASA-DFRCAccording to X-43A lead operations engineer David McAllister, who served as test director for the mission, the captive carry flight duplicated all operational functions of the planned 7,000-mph - or Mach 10 - flight and served as a training exercise for staff, except that the X-43A and its modified Pegasus booster were not released from NASA\'s B-52B launch aircraft and their engines were not ignited.\n"We have two primary purposes for doing a captive carry flight," said McAllister.\nAfter a review of captive-carry flight data, project engineers are expected to set a tentative date for the final X-43A flight for early November.\nAdditional coverage for subscribers:VIDEO: X-43A CAPTIVE CARRY FLIGHT TEST ON B-52 QTSUBSCRIBE NOW', 'date': None}, {'text': 'Storm death toll rises to 622 in Haiti\n\n(Agencies)\n\nUpdated: 2004-09-21 14:09\n\nThe death toll from a tropical storm that devastated parts of Haiti rose to 622 late Monday as search crews recovered hundreds of bodies carried away by raging weekend floods or buried by mud or the ruins of their homes, officials said.\n\n\n\nHaitian families stay outside of their houses after flooding and mudslides in Gonaives, Haiti, Monday, Sept. 20, 2004.

Since it developed last week, Jeanne has been blamed for at least 647 deaths, including 18 in the Dominican Republic and seven in Puerto Rico.\n\n\n\nThe northern Haitian city of Gonaives is seen flooded on September 19, 2004 after Hurricane Jeanne passed through.[Reuters]\n\nMany of the bodies stacked in Gonaives\' flood-damaged General Hospital were children.\n\nIn Gonaives, a city of about a quarter million, people waded through ankle-deep mud outside the mayor\'s office, where workers were shoveling out mud and doctors treated the wounded.\n\nDeslorges said the town\'s situation as "catastrophic." He said survivors "need everything from potable water to food, clothing, medication and disinfectants."\n\nA school bus lay smashed against a utility pole and waterlines up to 10-feet high showed the passage of the storm waters, which turned some roads into fast-flowing rivers.

Some 1,700 bodies were recovered and 1,600 more were missing and presumed dead.\n\nFloods are particularly devastating in Haiti, the poorest country in the Americas, because it is almost completely deforested, leaving few roots to hold back rushing waters or mudslides.\n\nGonaives also suffered fighting during the February rebellion that led to the ouster of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and left an estimated 300 dead.\n\nArgentine troops who are among more than 3,000 U.N. peacekeepers in Haiti treated at least 150 people injured by the floods in Gonaives, mostly for cuts on feet and legs, said Lt. Cmdr. Emilio Vera.\n\nOne man stood outside the flooded base used by the troops and asked soldiers to remove 11 bodies that were floating in his house, including four brothers and a sister.\n\n"I would like to see if the soldiers could do something about these bodies," said Jean-Saint Manus, a 30-year-old student. "The door was closed. Everybody was trapped inside."\n\nEquipment including the X-ray machine was covered with mud at Gonaives\' General Hospital, said Dr. Pierre-Marie Dieudonne, a doctor with the Catholic agency Caritas. He said there was a great need for antibiotics, food and water.\n\nThree trucks carrying Red Cross relief supplies from tents to blankets rolled in Monday, but two were mobbed by people who grabbed blankets and towels. U.N. troops stood by watching. Only one truck arrived intact with tents at the mayor\'s office.\n\nPeople tripped over each other to grab tiny bags of water thrown from a Red Cross truck in front of City Hall.\n\n"Everyone is desperate," said Pelissier Heber of the Artibonite Chamber of Commerce. "The international community is not doing anything so there\'s a general panic. The population is really mad because they were expecting more from the United Nations."\n\nInterim Prime Minister Gerard Latortue toured some flooded areas Sunday and declared Gonaives a disaster area, calling for international aid. The U.S. Embassy announced $60,000 in immediate relief.\n\nAt 11 p.m., Jeanne was about 405 miles east of Great Abaco Island in the Bahamas, with winds near 85 mph, moving northeast at about 7 mph.\n\nMeanwhile, Hurricane Karl and Tropical Storm Lisa remained far out in the Atlantic and were not immediate threats to land.

I put all my guests in their rooms and told them to get in the bathtubs." Ivan quickly deteriorated to a tropical storm after coming ashore. But forecasters warned it was not done yet: It threatened up to 15 inches of rain and flooding across the South, already soggy after Hurricanes Charley and Frances over the past month. And more danger could be on the horizon: Hurricane Jeanne is tearing through the Caribbean on a path that could take it into Florida early next week. More than 2 million residents along a 300-mile stretch of the Gulf Coast cleared out as Ivan, a former 165-mph monster that killed 70 people in the Caribbean, closed in on an unsteady path. Ivan came ashore near Gulf Shores Beach, Ala., around 3 a.m., but it was the Panhandle ― squarely in the northeast quadrant of the storm, where the winds are most violent ― that took the brunt.\n\nNOAA satellite image of Tropical Storm Ivan taken at 4:15 p.m. EDT on September 16, 2004, shows the once-powerful storm batters parts of the southeastern United States. Ivan, which had weakened to a tropical storm by Thursday afternoon as it churned inland, turned roads into debris-filled rivers and smashed piers and marinas in Alabama and northwestern Florida. [Reuters] Ivan spun off at least a dozen tornadoes in Florida, while creating a storm surge of 10 to 16 feet, topped by large battering waves. A portion of a bridge on Interstate 10, the major east-west highway through the Panhandle, was washed away. Insurance experts put the storm\'s damage at anywhere from $3 billion to $10 billion. The death toll included 13 in Florida, two in Mississippi, and one in Georgia. In Louisiana, four evacuees died after being taken from their storm-threatened homes to safer parts of the state. Many of the millions of Gulf Coast residents who spent a frightening night in shelters and boarded-up homes emerged to find Ivan was not the catastrophe many feared. New Orleans, especially vulnerable to storms because much of it lies below sea level, got only some blustery winds, a mere two-tenths of an inch of rain and only some downed tree limbs. By Thursday morning, French Quarter tourists came out of their hotels to sip cafe au lait under brilliant sunshine. "Leaves in the pool ― that\'s it," said Shane Eschete, assistant general manager of the Inn on Bourbon Street. "I know I\'m going to hear from the Monday morning quarterbacks," said New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin, who had urged the metropolitan area\'s 1.2 million residents to flee three days ahead of the storm. But he added: "Look at the scenes from Mobile and Pensacola ― that could have been us." Mobile, Ala., a port city of 200,000 that had been in the bull\'s-eye of the storm, got a break by an 11th-hour shift to the east. Still, its historic oak-tree-lined Government Street was blocked with tree limbs, metal signs, roofing material and other storm debris. The storm turned the night sky an eerie green with popping electrical transformers. Ivan\'s surf pounded Alabama beachfront resorts for hours, leaving condominium towers standing in a lake of floodwaters, at least one 5-story building crumbling in sand and sending some island homes into the Gulf of Mexico. An initial damage assessment in Gulf Shores found gutted shops, buckled concrete parking lots, and beachfront roads deep in sand. "The rain was going sideways. You could hear metal bending. It was just bad. It was my first one and there won\'t be a second," said Deb Harwick, who rode out the storm in a motel near Gulf Shores Beach. President Bush plans to visit Alabama and Florida to survey the damage on Sunday, the White House said. Tornado warnings were issued across northeast Florida again Thursday, even as search-and-rescue teams were sent to check the rubble for any victims of the night-before twisters. "It\'s sad," said a weary Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. "I don\'t know quite why we\'ve had this run of storms. You just have to accept that." Hundreds of thousands of people were without power, including 90 percent of Gulf Power Co.\'s customers in Florida. "It\'s catastrophic. The electric system it has taken us 80 years to build was basically destroyed in eight hours," spokesman John Hutchinson said, adding that it could take three weeks to restore power. In the Panhandle, destruction was seemingly around every corner. Huge magnolia trees had fallen across the streets, and the trunk of a 25-foot palm had snapped about eight feet off the ground. Bricks from St. Paul\'s United Methodist Church lay in heaps beside the building. Traffic lights lay shattered in the road. Telephone poles leaned over at precipitous angles, the wires sagging to the ground or just feet above it. Near one intersection, an Oldsmobile sat half-submerged in muddy floodwaters. A block away, two garbage bins and an aluminum rowboat blocked another street. Pleasure boats lay on top of one another in a jumble at a marina. About 1,700 people hunkered down overnight at the Pensacola Civic Center, which was converted into a Red Cross shelter. But evacuees had to be moved from floor to floor as water seeped through the walls, partially flooding the arena and third floor of the five-story building. "It was a force to be reckoned with.

The declaration for Florida was the third in a month, following those issued for hurricanes Charley and Frances.\n\nMore than 2,000 National Guard troops were moving into northwest Florida to assist with assessment and cleanup operations, Gov. Bush said.\n\n"Entire houses were taken off their foundations and disappeared because of the storm surge on the barrier islands," Gov. Bush said. "These are newly built luxury homes that don\'t exist right now. That\'s pretty powerful."\n\nIn Pensacola, winds sheared off the exterior of a section of West Florida Hospital, said a spokeswoman, but patient wings were undamaged. Three other hospitals in the area also were damaged, officials reported.\n\nStorm damage made travel from Pensacola difficult. Highway 90 was closed, as was Interstate 10 over Escambia Bay, where an 18-wheel truck plunged into the water and trapped the driver in the rig.\n\nWinds throughout the west Florida area bent billboard signs, damaged trees, ripped roofs off buildings and scattered debris.\n\n"As I have said before, man gets put in his place when he understands that at a particular point in time when it comes to nature, all he is is an observer," said Panama City Beach Mayor Lee Sullivan.\n\nDamage was heavy in other spots as well.

Diamond Offshore Drilling also reported a rig afloat, but it was located and the company reported no apparent damage or pollution.\n\nA spokesman for the Minerals Management Service said it was not unusual for drilling rigs to break free during a storm of Ivan\'s intensity.\n\nBut spokesman Curtis Carey said the potential danger is from damaged pipelines since the rigs\' anchors drag on the gulf floor. He said there have been no reports of damage to pipelines so far.\n\nThe Gulf of Mexico is home to about 25 percent of U.S. oil and gas production and there was concern about sustained disruptions to the flow of oil and gas.\n\nOil companies evacuated 545 offshore rigs as the storm approached, disrupting 83 percent of daily production -- about 1.7 million barrels of oil a day, the service said.\n\nIn addition, more than half of natural gas production was disrupted, the service reported.\n\nTropical Storm Jeanne\n\nHurricane Jeanne lost some of its strength Thursday, after it scraped the northern coast of the Dominican Republic and appeared headed for the Bahamas.\n\nJeanne had sustained winds of 70 mph (110 kph), the National Hurricane Center in Miami said.\n\nAs of 11 p.m., Jeanne\'s center was 65 miles (100 kilometers) northeast of Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic and was moving west-northwest at 6 mph (9 kph).

That estimate includes insured losses from direct wind damage, inland rain and flooding, and factors in inflated repair costs after 2004\'s storms. AIR Worldwide estimates a lower figure, in the range between $1 billion and $2.5 billion. Another loss modeling firm, Eqecat Inc., came in with a significantly higher estimate of Dennis\'s cost -- with insured losses between $3 billion and $8 billion. But that estimate was made soon after the storm came ashore, not later Sunday night when more data was available. AIR\'s estimate came out late Sunday, while the figure from Risk Management Solutions came out Monday. The loss estimate from catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide would make the season\'s first hurricane less costly than any of the four storms that hit the Southeast United States in 2004. Hurricane Dennis came ashore southeast of Pensacola, Fla., Sunday afternoon as a category 3 storm. That nearly followed the path of Hurricane Ivan, one of the 2004 storms. (For CNN.com\'s coverage of Hurricane Dennis, click here.) But AIR said there are four important differences between Dennis and Ivan -- intensity, size, speed and location -- that made Dennis less destructive. "While Dennis and Ivan were both category 3 hurricanes, Ivan had sustained wind speeds of 130 mph versus 120 mph for Dennis," according to a statement from AIR. "Hurricane Dennis was also a more compact storm. Ivan\'s peak winds extended about 25 miles from the center, while Dennis\'s peak winds extended only about 10 miles from the center, resulting in a much narrower swath of damage." Hurricane Ivan, which hit September 16, 2004, caused insurance payments of an estimated $7.1 billion, according to ISO\'s Property Claim Services (PCS), which tracks actual claims information rather than estimating damages from storm models, as AIR does. Ivan was the third of four hurricanes to hit the Southeast United States during a six-week period in 2004. The least expensive of those storms -- Hurricane Jeanne, which hit the U.S. coast Sept. 25, caused about $3.6 billion in insured losses, according to PCS. The fact that Dennis was moving faster than Ivan -- 21 mph compared to an estimated 13 mph for Ivan, also reduced the damage by the latest storm. "Damage does not occur instantaneously, rather it accumulates over time from repeated battering," said a statement from Atul Khanduri, manager of wind risk modeling for AIR Worldwide. "When prolonged winds occur over a very large geographic area, as in Hurricane Ivan, the number of claims can increase significantly. Losses for Dennis would have been higher had the storm moved at a slower pace." And while Dennis came ashore less than 50 miles east of the path followed by Ivan, there was less developed property in Dennis\' path. Reuters reported that Munich Re, the world\'s largest reinsurance firm, estimated Monday that the firm faces claims of between $84 million to $156 million from Dennis. The firm\'s clients are property and casualty insurers who buy reinsurance policies to limit their own risk of losses.

Poverty has transformed Haiti\'s once-verdant hills into a moonscape of bedrock ravaged by ravines.\n\nMore than 98 percent of its forests are gone, leaving no topsoil to hold rains. Even the mango and avocado trees have started to vanish, destroying a vital food source in favor of another necessity for the impoverished — charcoal for cooking.\n\n"The situation will continue, and other catastrophes are foreseeable," Jean-Andre Victor, one of Haiti\'s top ecologists, said in the capital, Port-au-Prince.\n\nMore than 800 are dead across Haiti from floods spawned by Tropical Storm Jeanne over the weekend, with 1,000 more missing and presumed dead. In May, light rains triggered floods that killed more than 3,000 people on Haiti\'s barren southern border with the Dominican Republic.\n\n"When you remove vegetation, the topsoil washes away. The earth isn\'t capable of absorbing rainfall," said Rick Perera of the international humanitarian group CARE, which supports alternative energy programs in Haiti to lessen dependence on charcoal.\n\nLess tree cover also means less regular rain, since trees "breathe" water vapor into the air. The result is a dropping water table, making for even poorer farmers, the backbone of Haiti\'s economy.\n\nA 90-minute flight from Miami, Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world. Most of its 8 million people don\'t have jobs, and political instability discourages foreign investors.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged donors on Wednesday to help Haiti recover from the "devastating natural disaster." But it\'s very much a man-made one.\n\nMost Haitians are descendants of African slaves brought over in the late 1600s by French colonizers who destroyed tens of thousands of acres of virgin forest to plant the cane that made Haiti the world\'s largest sugar producer. More wood was cut to fuel the sugar mills. Entire forests were shipped to Europe to make furniture of mahogany and dyes from campeachy.\n\nAfter rebellious slaves defeated Napoleon\'s army and Haiti became the world\'s first black republic in 1804, great plantations were divided among the slaves.\n\nUnder an inherited French law, land is shared among a man\'s heirs. One of the fastest growing populations in the world — Haitian women average five births each — has reduced the average holding to little more than a half acre. That\'s not enough to support a family of seven even in a good rainy season.\n\nPressed for income, farmers chopped trees to make and sell charcoal.\n\nFrom the air, you can see the border with the Dominican Republic, which shares Hispaniola island with Haiti. Lush forests stop suddenly and give way to barrenness. Vast stretches of the Dominican Republic remain in the hands of a wealthy few.\n\nThe difference in vegetation also is reflected in the death tolls. The Dominican Republic lost just 19 people to Jeanne, including 12 people who drowned in swollen rivers.\n\nIn 1950, about 25 percent of Haiti\'s 10,700 square miles was covered with forest, said Victor, the agronomist. In 1987, it was 10 percent. By 1994, 4 percent. Now, foreign and Haitian scientists find only about 1.4 percent of the Maryland-sized nation is forested, he said.\n\nHere in Gonaives, where rebels launched the rebellion that forced out President Jean-Bertrand Aristide last February, Jeanne deluged the region with rains for some 30 hours. Water-logged valleys behind the mountains funneled torrents of water that bloated the four rivers surrounding the gritty city of 250,000 people.\n\nAfter the May floods, interim Prime Minister Gerard Latortue, said, "The root of the problem is that we have to go and reforest the hills and until we do that, every two, three, four years after some heavy rain, the same thing could happen again."\n\nOver the past 20 years, the U.S. Agency for International Development has planted 60 million trees in Haiti, but the poor chop down 10 million to 20 million trees each year, said David Adams, USAID director in Haiti.\n\nPerera, the CARE official, said small-scale replanting projects and pilot programs using alternative cooking fuels such as solar energy and propane are trying to change habits. Still, 71 percent of the energy used in Haiti comes from charcoal, Victor said.\n\nThough the deforestation is obvious, many steeped in superstition believe the disasters are caused by a higher power, a belief that officials say makes it hard to fix the problems.\n\n"It was God who made this flood," said Eliphet Joseph, a 43-year-old salesman.\n\nOther people blame decades of official corruption and mismanagement.\n\n"The whole country\'s environment is messed up, that\'s why we had these (floods)," said Cherly Etienne, 28, who lost her cousin and aunt.\n\n', 'title': 'Haiti Floods Due To Deforestation', 'url': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/haiti-floods-due-to-deforestation/', 'keywords': ['deforestation', 'republic', 'floods', 'victor', 'haiti', 'haitis', 'rains', 'trees', 'million', 'water', 'dominican'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': "More than 800 are dead across Haiti from floods spawned by Tropical Storm Jeanne over the weekend, with 1,000 more missing and presumed dead.\nIn May, light rains triggered floods that killed more than 3,000 people on Haiti's barren southern border with the Dominican Republic.\nFrom the air, you can see the border with the Dominican Republic, which shares Hispaniola island with Haiti.\nThe Dominican Republic lost just 19 people to Jeanne, including 12 people who drowned in swollen rivers.\nOver the past 20 years, the U.S. Agency for International Development has planted 60 million trees in Haiti, but the poor chop down 10 million to 20 million trees each year, said David Adams, USAID director in Haiti.", 'date': None}, {'text': 'Many in Gonaives have had little food for a week\n\nGen Augusto Heleno Ribeiro Pereira criticised the slow pace of relief reaching residents, many of whom have had little food for a week.\n\nAround 150 more peacekeepers have been deployed to the city to stem looting.\n\nMore than 1,500 people across Haiti died in floods following tropical storm Jeanne, the government has said.\n\nPope John Paul II has donated $100,000 to the victims, the Vatican announced on Monday.\n\nGangrene\n\nPlaneloads of food supplies have arrived at Port-au-Prince since the floods struck a week ago.

Nine of the 17 storms are predicted to become hurricanes, and of those nine, five are expected to develop into intense or major hurricanes (Saffir/Simpson category 3-4-5) with sustained winds of 111 mph or greater.\n\nNo hurricanes made landfall along the U.S. coastline in 2006. The 2006 season witnessed a total of 10 named storms, 5 hurricanes and two major hurricanes. The 2005 season, considered unusual by the Colorado State forecast team, witnessed 27 named storms, 15 hurricanes and seven intense hurricanes. Long-term averages are 9.6 named storms, 5.9 hurricanes and 2.3 intense hurricanes per year.\n\n"We are calling for a very active hurricane season this year, but not as active as the 2004 and 2005 seasons," said Phil Klotzbach of the Colorado State hurricane forecast team. "Based on our latest forecast, the probability of a major hurricane making landfall along the U.S. coastline is 74 percent compared with the last-century average of 52 percent.\n\n"In December and January, we had a weak to moderate El Nino event in the tropical Pacific Ocean. When you have El Nino conditions during the hurricane season, it increases vertical wind shear across the tropical Atlantic and typically results in a weaker tropical cyclone season," Klotzbach said. "However, we\'ve seen El Nino conditions dissipate quite rapidly late this winter, so we do not think that\'s going to be an inhibiting factor this year. Also, we have warm Atlantic sea surface temperatures this year which we\'ve seen just about every year since 1995."\n\nThe hurricane forecast team predicts tropical cyclone activity in 2007 will be 185 percent of the average season. By comparison, 2005 witnessed tropical cyclone activity that was about 275 percent of the average season.\n\nThe hurricane forecast team reiterated its probabilities for a major hurricane making landfall on U.S. soil:\n\nA 74 percent chance that at least one major hurricane will make landfall on the U.S. coastline in 2007 (the long-term average probability is 52 percent).\n\nA 50 percent chance that a major hurricane will make landfall on the U.S. East Coast, including the Florida Peninsula (the long-term average is 31 percent)\n\nA 49 percent chance that a major hurricane will make landfall on the Gulf Coast from the Florida Panhandle west to Brownsville (the long-term average is 30 percent).\n\nThe team also predicted above-average major hurricane landfall risk in the Caribbean.\n\n"We were quite fortunate last year in that we had no hurricane landfalls," Klotzbach said. "The 2006 season was only the 12th year since 1945 that the United States witnessed no hurricane landfalls. Since then, we have had only two consecutive-year periods where there were no hurricane landfalls - 1981-1982 and 2000-2001."\n\nThe Colorado State hurricane forecast team has cautioned against reading too much into the hurricane seasons of 2004 and 2005 when Florida and the Gulf Coast were ravaged by four landfalling hurricanes each year. Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne caused devastating damage in 2004 followed by Dennis, Katrina, Rita and Wilma in 2005.\n\n"The activity of these two years was unusual, but within the natural bounds of hurricane variation," said William Gray, who began forecasting hurricane seasons at Colorado State 24 years ago. "Following the two very active seasons of 2004 and 2005, 2006 experienced slightly below-average activity with no landfalling hurricanes.\n\n"We\'ve had an upturn of major storms since 1995," Gray said. "We think this upturn of major storms will continue for another 15 or 20 years."\n\nProbabilities of tropical storm-force, hurricane-force and intense hurricane-force winds occurring at specific locations along the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts within a variety of time periods are listed on the forecast team\'s Landfall Probability Web site. The site provides U.S. landfall probabilities for 11 regions, 55 sub-regions and 205 individual counties along the U.S. coastline from Brownsville, Texas, to Eastport, Maine. The Web site, available to the public at http://www.e-transit.org/hurricane, is the first publicly accessible Internet tool that adjusts landfall probabilities for regions, sub-regions and counties based on the current climate and its projected effects on the upcoming hurricane season. Klotzbach and Gray update the site regularly with assistance from the GeoGraphics Laboratory at Bridgewater State College in Massachusetts.\n\nThe hurricane team\'s forecasts are based on the premise that global oceanic and atmospheric conditions - such as El Niño, sea surface temperatures and sea level pressures - that preceded active or inactive hurricane seasons in the past provide meaningful information about similar trends in future seasons.\n\nFor 2007, Gray and the hurricane forecast team expect continued warm tropical and north Atlantic sea-surface temperatures, prevalent in most years since 1995, as well as neutral or weak La Nina conditions - a recipe for greatly enhanced Atlantic basin hurricane activity. These factors are similar to conditions that occurred during the 1952, 1964, 1966, 1995 and 2003 seasons. The average of these five seasons had well above-average activity, and Klotzbach and Gray predict the 2007 season will have activity in line with the average of these five years.\n\nGray does not attribute changes in recent and projected Atlantic hurricane activity to human-induced global warming.\n\n"Although global surface temperatures have increased over the last century and over the last 30 years, there is no reliable data available to indicate increased hurricane frequency or intensity in any of the globe\'s seven tropical cyclone basins, except for the Atlantic over the past 12 years," Gray said. "Meteorologists who study tropical cyclones have no valid physical theory as to why hurricane frequency or intensity would necessarily be altered significantly by small amounts of global mean temperature change."\n\n\n\n', 'title': 'Very Active 2007 Hurricane Season Predicted', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/04/070403172305.htm', 'keywords': ['tropical', 'major', 'predicted', 'forecast', 'landfall', 'team', 'hurricanes', 'average', 'hurricane', 'atlantic', '2007', 'active', 'season'], 'tags': {'Hurricanes and Cyclones', 'Global Warming', 'Climate', 'Natural Disasters', 'Weather', 'Oil Spills', 'Severe Weather', 'Storms'}, 'summary': 'The U.S. Atlantic basin will likely experience a very active hurricane season, the Colorado State University forecast team announced today, increasing its earlier prediction for the 2007 hurricane season.\n"We are calling for a very active hurricane season this year, but not as active as the 2004 and 2005 seasons," said Phil Klotzbach of the Colorado State hurricane forecast team.\nWhen you have El Nino conditions during the hurricane season, it increases vertical wind shear across the tropical Atlantic and typically results in a weaker tropical cyclone season," Klotzbach said.\nThe hurricane forecast team predicts tropical cyclone activity in 2007 will be 185 percent of the average season.\nThe team also predicted above-average major hurricane landfall risk in the Caribbean.', 'date': 1175904000}, {'text': 'Uprooted trees are just one sign of the hurricane\'s devastating effect\n\nWaves around two-storeys high were reported on its eastern shores as Hurricane Ivan ripped up trees and roofs and left two people dead.\n\nPrime Minister PJ Patterson declared a state of emergency and the national electricity grid was shut down leading to a black-out across the island.\n\nTroops are patrolling the streets, but there have been reports of looting.\n\nHurricane Ivan has already left a massive trail of damage in the Caribbean, killing at least 27 people, mostly in Grenada.\n\nCourse changing\n\nWinds have increased in the last few hours to 155mph (250km/h).

The storm exposed inadequate code standards that were based on old data or flagrant violations that slipped inspection.\n\nIn some cases, there were not enough nails affixing plywood sheets to roof trusses, or the nails used weren’t strong enough. In others, unprotected windows and doors were too weak to withstand flying debris. Many of the damaged or destroyed roofs were not braced or strapped down properly, and roof shingles and tiles were not properly installed.\n\nThe damage caught the attention of building officials across a state with no single uniform code, and they began investigating their own standards. Some changes came immediately in South Florida, such as the banning of certain types of wood roofing materials, said Tim Reinhold, a vice president of the Tampa-based Institute for Business and Home Safety. The organization was created by the insurance industry to promote hazard resistant construction, maintenance and preparation practices.\n\nIn 1995, officials decided to apply the high-wind standards of the Standard Building Code, which was widely used in the Southeast, to all of Florida, Reinhold said.\n\nThen, in the late 1990s, three building codes being used as models nationally merged to form the International Building Code, Reinhold said, while Florida was developing its own code that became effective in 2002.\n\nIn 2004, the state adopted the International Building Code as a model, adding some Florida-specific aspects, Reinhold said. New homes are built according to the code, and breaks on insurance rates await homeowners who retrofit their homes to comply with current standards. Meanwhile, homebuilders such as Charlie Johnson Builder and Mercedes Homes offer homes with hurricane resistant features such as better roofing materials, concrete walls and out-swinging doors.\n\nIncluded in the code is a wind-borne debris region, which requires certain homes to have door and window protections up to 120 mph. The Panhandle had been exempt from that provision, but a bill awaiting Gov. Charlie Crist’s signature eliminates the exemption and makes a uniform state building code.\n\nThe code also established new standards for roofing, created more thorough inspection processes and required that products used in home construction meet approved hurricane standards.\n\nThese changes began to be applied in homes built after 1994 and were tested in hurricanes Charley, Ivan, Frances and Jeanne, all of which came ashore in Florida in 2004.\n\nIn 2005, University of Florida researchers studied the differences in damage between older and newer homes, comparing 200 randomly selected homes that were in the path of the highest wind zones generated by the hurricanes.\n\nThe study concluded that homes built under the 2002 Florida Building Code sustained less damage on average than homes built between 1994 and 2001 under the Standard Building Code. Homes built before 1994 also fared worse than those built after that year.\n\nIn Charlotte County, nearly 30 percent of the surveyed homes built under the new code that faced winds up to 150 mph in Hurricane Charley had no shingle damage, the study showed. Meanwhile, the study found that every surveyed home built under older code experienced at least some shingle loss.\n\n“We’re living in a state that’s obviously very prone to hurricane damage, but the good news is that the state is very proactive about trying to create and enforce building codes that are appropriate for safety issues,” said Kurt Gurley, a University of Florida associate professor of civil engineering who worked on the study funded by a $90,000 grant from the Florida Building Commission.\n\nBut the 2004 storms did expose some problems. A failure seen among new homes was with the soffits, or vents located below roof overhangs to allow air to circulate through the attic. Wind sometimes damaged or blew out the soffits, allowing wind-driven rain to enter the attic, soaking insulation and damaging ceilings.\n\nThe problem was seen again in Hurricane Wilma in 2005, when older roofs were damaged after shingles or tiles were torn off by winds and water entered attics.\n\n“If we build to the latest code, structurally you’re in reasonable shape,” Reinhold said. “You’re probably not going lose your roofs … and structurally after the storm it’ll be fairly much intact. But we still have a lot of water intrusion issues where were going to have ceiling collapse.”\n\nOne way to tackle the water intrusion issue is through additional research.\n\nThe Institute for Business and Home Safety has received bids from three state universities to house a $20 million laboratory that will be big enough to hold a two-story home that will be hit by 140 mph winds and rain.\n\nThe lab, which Reinhold hopes will begin functioning near the end of the 2008 hurricane season, would allow researchers to test how the code and building products resist the effects of a hurricane – without waiting for a storm to strike.\n\n“You could come up with a design on paper that maybe helps keep some of the water out of the home, but until you actually subject it to a hurricane, there are a lot of big question marks,” Gurley said. “That’s the idea – to sort of build this crash test for homes.”\n\nCopyright 2018 Associated Press.

Peanut and cotton farmers pondered their ruin in rain-soaked Georgia, toppled trees and flooding were major concerns in Virginia, and funeral directors were working in seven states.\n\nIn all, Ivan has been blamed for 70 deaths in the Caribbean and at least 40 in the United States, 16 of them in Florida. In 1999, Hurricane Floyd was directly responsible for 56 deaths in the United States and one in the Bahamas.\n\nIvan\'s damaging rains have landed on huge tracts of land already made soggy by either Frances, which struck earlier this month, or Charley, which hit last month -- or both.\n\n"It\'s sad," said Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. "I don\'t know quite why we\'ve had this run of storms. You just have to accept that."\n\nBy early Friday evening, nine tornadoes spun off by Ivan had touched down in Virginia, pushing the storm\'s tally of twisters, which destroyed hundreds of homes in Florida and Georgia, to more than 20. Gov. Mark Warner declared the third state of emergency in Virginia in three weeks.\n\nAlthough Ivan has been downgraded to a tropical depression, heavy rainfall was expected to continue across the state into today, causing flooding in low-lying areas and near waterways. Officials also warned of flooding in spots where it doesn\'t normally occur because of drenched ground and said the downpours would cause mudslides in areas with steep terrain.\n\nThe misery is being wrought by the remnants of a hurricane that seemed incomprehensible only a few weeks ago, when it was a baby tropical storm far off in the Caribbean. People in emergency operations centers that were opened to clean up after Hurricane Frances joked then that Ivan might never make land.\n\nNow, as Ivan lurches northward, another storm -- Jeanne -- is forming in the Caribbean and worrying many that it will follow Charley, Frances and Ivan to Florida. Jeanne\'s projected track has drifted slightly east, away into the Atlantic, but the east coast of Florida remains in the National Hurricane Center\'s range of possible landfall points.\n\nHere, on the Florida-Alabama border, long stretches of the beach road are one-laners now. Half the road is just gone.\n\nThe beach itself has been relocated to the dance floor of the Flora-Bama Lounge, a musty, grimy, wondrous roadhouse that sits on the border of the two states. The lounge, which has hosted headliners from Kid Rock to Hank Williams Jr., is so beloved that word of its possible demise was greeted with almost as much dismay as the persistence of power outages and the endless waits for ice and water. The sand rises halfway to the ceiling -- and what a ceiling it is: covered with dollar bills and dangling bras placed there in happier, raunchier times.\n\nBut despite the transformation, the annual interstate mullet toss will live again, the regulars said Friday as they ducked into the sagging hulk that was -- and is sure to be again -- Perdido Key\'s best-known landmark.\n\n"We party hard," said Paul Bell, a maintenance worker so loyal that he stayed at the bar during the storm. "Don\'t worry. We\'ll make it bigger and better."\n\nThe sentiment was the same up and down the battered Gulf Coast. Cranes lifted debris all day, and power tools whirred. Someone spray-painted "Hurricane who?" on the plywood protecting the windows of a motel in Panama City Beach. A boat was turned upside down on the side of the street. At Hamilton\'s Restaurant and Lounge there, Ray Pettis vowed to rebuild even though shreds of his roof were found two miles away.\n\n"We\'ve survived 11 different hurricanes," said Pettis, who has worked at the restaurant for more than half of his 37 years. "We\'ve been here too long to just let it go."\n\nOn the roads leading into town, ancient oak trees were down, crushed homes and businesses marred the view, and telephone poles lay splintered. People sat in their cars at gas stations, hoping to be the first in line when -- if -- the power came on.\n\nFlorida and its Gulf Coast neighbors -- Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi -- are hurricane veterans, and people there prepared extensively for Ivan\'s arrival. But people in other states drenched by the storm were less prepared.\n\n"We did have some idea that Hurricane Ivan was heading our way, but some people got caught off guard," said Jennifer Collins, a spokeswoman for the Georgia Emergency Management Agency. "Georgians are very resilient, however, and people are already going through the recovery process."\n\nYet even as the relief effort began, much of northern Georgia\'s Gilmer County was under water, and flooding was also reported in the Atlanta area.\n\nSome of the worst flooding was in North Carolina, where at least eight deaths are blamed on the storm.\n\nFarms were battered throughout the South, but nowhere worse than Georgia, where the peanut and cotton crops are in perilous conditions. Many fields are flooded, and growers are hoping that the waters will recede soon enough to let them get into the fields and harvest before more storms arrive.\n\nGeorgia\'s crop woes come after Frances and Charley devastated Florida\'s citrus industry, making the trio of storms a huge threat to the stability of the Southeast\'s agricultural industry.\n\nBut the concerns about the plants in the groves were outweighed Friday by the concerns of people in the streets. Thousands are in shelters. Hourlong lines are forming for gasoline and water. And waves are breaking through countless seaside homes.\n\nDeath and destruction in 10 states\n\nState-by-state developments with Ivan:\n\n-- Alabama: Four deaths, about 880,000 utility customers were without power.\n\n-- Florida: Sixteen deaths, about 430,000 without power. Electricity, water and sewer services could take weeks to fix in some areas.\n\n-- Georgia: Four deaths, about 223,000 without power.\n\n-- Louisiana: Four deaths, about 1,000 without power.

(See video of the looting -- 1:25)\n\nOfficials could not yet provide accurate estimates for fatalities or time needed for recovery in the area and are focusing, instead, on widespread search-and-rescue operations.\n\nThe death toll from the storm so far is estimated at 70 -- mostly in Mississippi. Officials stressed that the number is uncertain and likely to be much higher. (See aerial video of the aftermath -- 3:02)\n\n"A lot of people lost their lives, and we still don\'t have any idea [how many], because the focus continues to be on rescuing those who have survived," Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco told reporters Tuesday.\n\nElsewhere along the Gulf Coast, authorities used boats and helicopters to reach stranded residents and search for survivors.\n\nThe storm ripped ashore in Louisiana on Monday morning with winds topping 140 mph before scourging Mississippi and Alabama.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard said its crews assisted in the rescue Monday of about 1,200 people stranded by high water in the New Orleans area, and thousands more were rescued Tuesday morning.\n\nWaters rising in New Orleans\n\nNew Orleans was left with no power, no drinking water, dwindling food supplies, widespread looting, smoke rising on the horizon and the sounds of gunfire. At least one large building was ablaze Tuesday. (Full story)\n\nMayor Ray Nagin told CNN that at least 30 buildings had collapsed, but that no attempt had been made to determine a death toll.\n\n"There are dead bodies floating in some of the water," Nagin said. "The rescuers would basically push them aside as they were trying to save individuals."\n\nNagin said that as of late Tuesday "a significant amount of water" is flowing into the bowl-shaped city and sections of the city now dry could be under 9 or 10 feet of water within hours.\n\n"The bowl is filling up," he said.\n\nFrustration was also rising among people who now find themselves refugees in their own city.\n\nThousands of people were being housed in the Louisiana Superdome, where toilets were overflowing and there was no air conditioning to provide relief from 90-degree heat.\n\nNagin estimated the number of people in the Superdome at between 12,000 and 15,000 people as of late Tuesday. He said they could be there for a week unless evacuated sooner.\n\nBlanco said officials are making plans to evacuate people from the Superdome and other shelters, but she did not say when that might happen or where they might be taken.\n\nThe city\'s main public hospital, Charity Hospital, was no longer functioning and was being evacuated, Blanco said.\n\nAlso under way was the evacuation of more than 1,000 people from Tulane University Hospital with the help of the U.S. military, hospital spokeswoman Karen Troyer Caraway said.\n\n"It\'s an unbelievable situation," she said. "We\'re completely surrounded by water. There\'s looting going on in the streets around the hospital."\n\nHundreds of people were looting businesses downtown, throwing rocks through store windows and hauling away goods.\n\nNational Guard troops moved into the downtown business district, and state police squads backed by SWAT teams were sent in to scatter looters and restore order, authorities said late Tuesday.\n\nNagin told Mississippi television station WAPT a police officer was shot and wounded when he surprised a looter Tuesday, but the officer was expected to recover.\n\nThe biggest problem facing authorities, they said, was an inability to communicate.\n\nNearly all of the parishes in the New Orleans area -- Orleans, St. John the Baptist, Plaquemines, St. Tammany and Jefferson -- have curfews in place.\n\nInmates from a flooded parish jail were relocated to a freeway on-ramp, where they sat out in the sun, under the watch of armed officers.\n\nNagin said 80 percent of the city was under water, which was 20 feet deep in some places. (See video of knee-deep and rising water in the French Quarter -- 1:19)\n\nWater from Lake Pontchartrain was pouring into the downtown area from a levee breach, rising steadily throughout the day. (Map)\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reported two major breaches in the levee system that protects New Orleans, much of which lies below sea level.\n\nAuthorities warned that efforts to limit the flooding have been unsuccessful, and that residents may not be able to return home for a month.\n\n"The Corps Of Engineers has attempted to fix the situation under emergency conditions," Blanco told CNN. "They\'re not the best conditions, and probably too little, too late."\n\nGetting anything into New Orleans will be difficult because of the damage to two bridge spans seven miles long that carry Interstate 10 over Lake Pontchartrain, linking the city to points east.\n\n"This is a tragedy of great proportions, greater than any we\'ve see in our lifetimes," Blanco said. "We know many lives have been lost."\n\nThe governor also said it was "impossible to even begin to estimate" how long it will take to restore power and drinking water in New Orleans.\n\nDeath toll rising in Mississippi\n\nKatrina has inflicted more damage to Mississippi beach towns than did Hurricane Camille, and its death toll is likely to be higher, the state\'s governor said Tuesday. (Full story)\n\nCamille killed 143 people when it struck the state\'s coastal counties in 1969 and a total of 256 after it swept inland.\n\n"There are structures after structures that survived Camille with minor damage that are not there any more," Gov. Haley Barbour told reporters in Jackson.\n\nKatrina destroyed "every one" of the casinos that raked in $500,000 per day in revenues to state coffers, Barbour said after a helicopter tour of the affected areas.\n\n"There were 10- and 20-block areas where there was nothing -- not one home standing," he said.\n\nBarbour would not give a confirmed death toll, but said it was likely to be higher than previous reports of 50 to 80 dead.\n\nJason Green of the Harrison County Coroner\'s Office said funeral homes in Gulfport had received 26 bodies since the storm passed Monday.\n\nIn the small town of Bay St. Louis, search and rescue crews put paint marks on homes known to contain bodies, because there weren\'t enough refrigerated trucks to remove the corpses.\n\nIn Biloxi, an employee of the city\'s Grand Casino was awed by the extent of the damage.\n\n"I was a senior in high school when Hurricane Camille hit, in 1969, and I have never seen destruction of this magnitude," said Scott Richmond.\n\nPart of the city\'s sea wall was washed away, and nearly every downtown building had extensive damage to its first level.\n\nState emergency management officials said 80 percent of the state\'s residents had no power.\n\nIn Biloxi, a 25-foot swell of water crashed in from the Gulf of Mexico Monday and inundated structures there.\n\nUp to 30 people are believed to have been killed when an apartment complex on the beach collapsed in the storm.\n\nDistraught resident Harvey Jackson told a local television station about losing his wife in the floodwater as they stood on their roof. (Watch the video report of a husband whose wife slipped from his grip -- 1:07 )\n\n"I held her hand as tight as I could and she told me, \'You can\'t hold me.\' She said \'Take care of the kids and the grandkids,\' " he sobbed. (Victims left with nothing)\n\nStreets and homes were flooded as far as 6 miles inland from the beach, and looting was reported in Biloxi and in Gulfport, officials said.\n\nOther developments\n\n• In Mobile, Alabama, the storm pushed water from Mobile Bay into downtown, submerging large sections of the city, and officials imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew.

But right now, he\'s facing a loaded gun and a loaded question, and he\'s got three seconds to come up with the right answer. This is where the disaster reconstruction business gets tricky. "You with emergency response?" he\'s asked.\n\nThe National Guard soldier is at the window of Hillebrand\'s pickup, waiting for a reply. Behind him, two armored trucks are blocking the road and six other soldiers are standing by to shoot looters and turn back anyone--anyone--who\'s not saving lives or recovering bodies. Just yesterday, eight assumed looters had been gunned down 40 miles away, on the Danziger Bridge in New Orleans.\n\nBut behind the blockade, tantalizingly close, are the ruined casinos and splintered beachfront mansions of Gulfport, Miss. Hillebrand tries to keep his face nonchalantly vague, while furiously scrawling a risk-benefit matrix across his mind\'s eye:\n\nOption No. 1: Lie, get caught, have the truck impounded, and sit behind bars while the competition is snapping up contracts. This would be a bad scenario under normal circumstances, but it\'s especially bleak right now because the only person within 500 miles who could bail him out happens to be sitting right next to him: his boss, Ed Weingartner, the 36-year-old CEO of Dynamic Restoration.\n\nOption No. 2: Tell the truth, and pass up the opportunity to be the only catastrophe contractor on the ground at the catastrophe of a lifetime. All day long, Weingartner and Hillebrand have seen swarms of bright-green ServPro vans whizzing around on the unrestricted side of town, hustling business from waterlogged apartments and deroofed homes. Even worse, they rounded a corner and were stung to find a team of black and yellow In-Star Services Group trucks not only here, but already at work on a big job, drying out the Hancock Bank.\n\nNo doubt about it, the disaster recovery game is on and the clock is ticking. The evacuees of Gulfport may still be waiting out of state for their city to dry, but the masters of disasters are arriving in force and moving fast. Millions are up for grabs--make that billions--but not for long. Emergency mold and repair work will be doled out at once, and the disaster contractor who gets his foot in the door with those patch jobs will be first in line if big-scale construction is needed afterward.\n\nAt the moment, all of the disaster specialists are fighting over the same, less severely hit inland swath of Gulfport, but if Hillebrand and Weingartner can somehow sliiiide on through this military blockade, they\'ll be the only team prowling the most horrific devastation along the beach. Ironically, that\'s one advantage their young company has; since all the cool corporate colors were already chosen by giants like In-Star and Belfor, Dynamic ended up with neutral white and blue, the stock paint job, coincidentally, of small-town cop cars. So while there\'s no way ServPro or InStar could fool the National Guard with their glaring vans, institutional-looking Dynamic might have a chance. Hillebrand decides how to answer so quickly he still has two seconds to spare.\n\n"Yessir," he says, then adds, "See?"--which sounds like something real emergency responders would say. Except, of course, we\'re not. The soldier pokes his head inside the cab for a look. A thicket of technology is sprouting from the multiplug in the cigarette lighter--GPS, two BlackBerrys, two cell phones--while the pickup\'s bed is crammed with air movers and bottled water, exactly the stuff a smart thief would have hauled through the shattered window of his local Home Depot and would now be hawking in the disaster zone. What the soldier doesn\'t see is anything like defibrillators, cadaver dogs, or body exhumation tools.\n\nBut then, the soldier\'s eyes land on the truck\'s blue logo, which matches the blue polos of the guys in the front seat. You can almost see the wheels turning in his mind: "Dynamic Restoration? Restoring to life? Maybe?" He\'s got a sheriff\'s van waiting impatiently behind us, so he needs to make a call.\n\n"Okay," the soldier says. "Stay safe, fellas." He spirals an arm over his head, signaling his colleagues in the armored trucks to spread and let us through.\n\n"Ohhhh, man...," we start to exhale, until we see what lies ahead and suck in our breath again.\n\nEd Weingartner started Dynamic Restoration in 1994, after he spent a weekend hanging out with his buddy Fred Gunther at the Daytona 500. Fred was rolling in cash because he\'d found a great new niche for his Grand Sport Auto Body shops: He\'d begun specializing in insurance-referred rebuild jobs. It was a sweet set-up, Gunther said, because the money was guaranteed; insurance companies were much more reliable about writing checks than car owners. "You know, Ed, they do the same thing with houses," Gunther told him.\n\nWeingartner\'s ears perked up. As a 26-year-old who\'d graduated from Fairfield University a few years earlier, he\'d been looking for a way to break from his father\'s suburban Philadelphia construction company. He\'d tried an internship on Wall Street, but power ties and risky trades weren\'t for him. He liked to gamble, but on his own performance, not some other company\'s. He\'d returned to working with his father, thinking he could control a few projects on his own, but his dad wasn\'t the delegating type.\n\nSo he gave his dad notice and rented office space inside a storage facility. Dynamic\'s founding headquarters were three 10 x 12 storage units that could have been veal calf cages, except for the phone lines. Weingartner hired a college kid to do the books and a former electrician as a project manager. As humble a start as that was, it soon deteriorated. Weingartner got the chance to bid on a few small residential jobs and found he didn\'t know the first thing about estimating. "I\'m giving a lump sum like $5,000, and people are laughing at me," he recalls. "They\'re like, \'No, no, how much you charging me for 500 feet of soffit?\' \'I don\'t know.\' \'How much you charging me for flashing?\' \'I don\'t know.\' After two months of being ridiculed, I bought the estimating package and started doing my homework."\n\nLuckily, Gunther helped him get a break. Big hailstorms had pummeled the Philly suburbs that winter, damaging so many homes that the insurance companies had to deputize some of their car adjusters and turn them, overnight, into house adjusters. They knew even less about home reconstruction than Weingartner did, so when they were asked to give the kid a break by their old auto body pal, Gunther, they began tossing Dynamic jobs.\n\nWeingartner began to learn the business--fast. He became trained in the crucial estimating tool--unit-cost pricing, a standardized system in the contracting trade that assigns a fixed dollar value to the installation of every piece of material --and sharpened his eye to discern which jobs were worth taking and which adjusters were worth courting. Even though adjusters can\'t assign the work directly, they can suggest a contractor, and since most homeowners and small-business owners have never seen their life\'s investment destroyed before, they have no idea whom to call. "The adjusters have to avoid any kind of collusion with contractors because it could look like they\'re conspiring against their clients, the property owners," Weingartner explains. "But the adjusters run the show."\n\nWeingartner also learned that disaster contractors have three types and two fates: There are the lightweight mom-and-pops who do residential drying and small rebuilding, usually making $1,500 to $3,000 a job; then come the middleweights that focus on the $10,000 to $20,000 residential and small corporate jobs; and finally, the bruisers like multinational Belfor and franchiser ServPro, which handle the big corporate jobs. But there is no stasis: You either move up a weight class or one of the big boys will eventually buy you out or drive you out.\n\nSo Weingartner quickly expanded to three locations, operating from strength in the areas he knew well: the pricey suburbs of West Chester, Pa.; the dense corporate downtown of Wilmington, Del.; and the wind-lashed beachfronts of Ocean City, Md. In 2004, he convinced a father and son to invest $1 million so he could take the next big step: setting up a catastrophic response team in DeLand, Fla., right on the fringes of the hurricane zone.\n\nHe managed to hire some seasoned young hands, like Jamie Moore, a savvy construction salesman who became director of business development, and Barry Hillebrand, who\'d worked for years as a stormchaser for one of Dynamic\'s big rivals (he\'d rather not say which).\n\nWith his team in place, Weingartner was nicely positioned for the 2004 hurricane season, which thanks to Frances and Jeanne turned out to be a doozy. Dynamic became skilled at working in the eeriness of a dark, dead city, with no traffic lights, people, gas, or food. And it began billing a lot of money--it grew 326% from 2001 to 2004 and earned $11.4 million last year to place No. 434 on this year\'s Inc. 500--but took some lumps. One of the worst was when Weingartner got overly eager and agreed to rebuild two condo developments for $2.9 million without getting any money up front. One year later, the homeowners\' association still hasn\'t paid. It\'s now costing Weingartner $300 an hour in legal fees to shake the money out of them.\n\nCatastrophic is the way to go," says Ed Weingartner. "You can earn $12 million to $20 million on one hurricane, easy."\n\n"Still, catastrophic is the way to go," he believes. A good year for one of his regional offices will bring in $2 million--about 40 jobs--so the total for his three locations is less than $6 million. But chasing hurricanes is far more lucrative than that. "I can make 10 times that with catastrophic," he says. "You can earn $12 million to $20 million on one hurricane, easy, and make such a name for yourself, you\'re either set for work or bought out."\n\nOr you can blow it all. "Man, you read the storm warnings wrong, and you can be too far out of the action or too deep in it," he frets. "You can be dropping thousands of dollars on hotel rooms and be four cities away, or reserve tons of equipment and have nothing to do with it."\n\nBy the time the winds started swirling off the Gulf Coast in August, Dynamic Restoration was mobilizing for its biggest test.\n\nSoon after we sneak through the blockade, Hillebrand stops the truck. The three of us stare in awe.\n\nThe road is cratered and buckled so badly it could have been pelted by comets. Gigantic dunes of torn timber and crushed appliances rise on either side of the cracked street; what was once a residential neighborhood has been smashed down to its component parts--raw wood, twisted aluminum, shattered cinder block--then shoved by the wall of water into long, tidy heaps, as if the whiskbroom of God would be by presently to sweep up.\n\nHillebrand creeps the truck down the road, snaking slowly between crevasses so he\'ll be able to burn rubber if he feels the asphalt collapsing beneath us--or so we hope. We\'ve got the windows up tight, to minimize the stench of raw sewage from the broken sewer main that has been pulled up like a weed and heaved against the snarled trunks of uprooted oaks. Two police on horseback are picking their way slowly over the rubble of a collapsed condo, looking for signs of life. A camouflaged Humvee rumbles along the sandy coastline, while Army Chinook choppers thump by overhead.\n\nThis isn\'t the first firepower Hillebrand has faced in his career, and it won\'t be the last of the day. Guns seem to be bristling from the rubble. Hundreds of mercenaries have reportedly been choppered into New Orleans to guard evacuated mansions and company headquarters. These aren\'t standard-issue security guards; for this job, private military companies like Blackwater, which works in Baghdad, and Israeli-trained ISI have been brought in, M16s in hand. In Gulfport, warnings are sprayed everywhere in menacing black paint: "Trespassers Will Be Met at Gunpoint," "This Was My House! The One Thing I Got Left Is My Gun. Stay Away!" "You Loot, We Shoot."\n\nIt\'s easy to see why the government set up a checkpoint. "Way-ull, ah told the man the truth," Hillebrand drawls. "Just depends what you mean by \'emergency response."\n\nHe sounds like a wise old hand with his hominy \'n\' grits accent and gospel-style exclamations, so it\'s a surprise to realize he\'s only 41 and not even showing the stress of hard miles in his lank brown hair and well-tended belly roll. Weingartner, meanwhile, looks like the assistant coach of every high school football team in America, with his dark cropped hair and clean Dynamic polo shirt tucked neatly into his crisp khakis. They\'re equally intense but pace their energy very differently: Weingartner is all intensity, all the time, while Hillebrand seems to amble along until it\'s time for action. "Barry lives for the belly of the beast," Weingartner says. "He likes to get into a storm zone when the trees are still flying."\n\nWe make it to the beach, turn right on the coastal promenade, and are amazed at the sight of...nothing. Nothing but gaping foundations and the occasional hint as to what once stood above: a fragmented Outback Steakhouse sign, the shredded canopy from a Ramada Inn snagged in the roots of a torn-up tree. There\'s something eerily familiar about this scene, something impossibly familiar, but I can\'t place it. It must be the climax of Planet of the Apes, I think, before it hits me: It\'s exactly like Huambo, once a jewel of a city in central Angola, which had been bombarded by 20 years of civil war and which I visited as a war correspondent. One day of wind has matched two decades of determined guerrilla artillery.\n\n"Lord, lord," Hillebrand breathes. "Fifteen years in the business and I\'ve never seen anything like this."\n\nWeingartner is on his cell, reporting in to a Nationwide adjuster. "Georgie, you\'re not going to believe Gulfport when you get here. It\'s in-sane. If your Kmart is downtown, you\'re okay. But if it\'s on the beach, it\'s probably gone. Completely. We\'ll run by both and get back to you."\n\nWeingartner clicks off and turns to Hillebrand. "This is more than I bargained for."\n\n"Hang on till we find it," Hillebrand says. "Maybe we\'ll all get lucky."\n\nWe\'re on a recon mission for Nationwide, looking for a Kmart with a $5 million policy, to see if the goods can be saved with a speedy roof tarping and mold mitigation. If water damage can be halted within 48 hours, it could save Nationwide a fortune in demolition and rebuilding. It might even get the store open in a few days, instead of a few weeks or months, and dodge the bulk of lost-business payouts.\n\nSome 10,000 adjusters are supposed to be pouring into Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi soon, but amazingly, none seems to have shown up yet. Usually insurance companies start at the center of the devastation and work outward, settling the claims of their most crippled customers before progressing to the fringes. This morning, the industry announced it would be doing the opposite: Because it couldn\'t guarantee "basic livable conditions"--food, water, beds, and lack of gunfire--it would be keeping the adjusters out of Mississippi and Louisiana.\n\nOf course, that didn\'t stop Hillebrand and the other cowboys. The hurricane hit Mississippi full force on Monday night; by Tuesday morning, Hillebrand had his truck loaded with food, water, and equipment and was on his way. Meanwhile, Weingartner was back in his main office in Pennsylvania, making the crucial decisions that can make or break a disaster recovery company: guessing exactly where to preposition his crews, figuring out how much equipment to rent or relocate, deciding whether to lock in additional labor now or hold tight and wait for the work to be secured.\n\nA few days later, Weingartner flew into Mobile, Ala. Until the adjusters arrive in person, the insurance companies use the disaster contractors as their unofficial scouts. Weingartner is happy to do the favor, of course. Keeping the adjusters and property managers happy is, literally, a full-time job. At this moment, even while the biggest opportunity of his career is unfolding, he has dispatched Jamie Moore to meet with Red Lobster\'s catastrophic loss guys in Florida, even though the seafood chain has had only two minor bouts of storm damage in five years. One adjuster in particular is notorious for calling Moore at bizarrely early hours of the morning, just to talk shop. It never turns into a work order, but Moore keeps picking up. You never know.\n\n"It\'s the biggest dilemma I\'ve got," says Weingartner. "Do I spend a $60,000 salary on a great job manager or on a great marketing rep? It doesn\'t matter how clean the job site is and how awesomely we dry out property if none of the insurance companies knows who we are. But what if we sell ourselves like gangbusters and don\'t have top-quality workers to back it up? I worry about it all the time."\n\nWe continue creeping along the coastal road in search of the Kmart. Judging by the devastation we\'ve seen along the waterfront, Weingartner is getting a sick feeling that the damage will be way beyond Dynamic\'s capabilities. "Here it is," Hillebrand says, eyeing the GPS on his dash.\n\n"Where?" Weingartner asks, swiveling his head.\n\nHillebrand looks up from the screen. "Oughta be around here some..."\n\n"Ah, jeez," Weingartner says. "There it is." He\'s pointing to a sagging steel frame with a blue K on the skeletal roof. It\'s a bitter blow: He would have loved nothing better than to nail down a fat contract with a brand-name client--someone he can later put on his brochure. Now he\'s lost a full day and risked getting arrested for nothing.\n\nWeingartner points to a sagging steel frame with a blue K on the skeletal roof. It\'s a bitter blow: "Good news and bad news, Georgie!"\n\nWell, almost nothing. He makes the call to Nationwide and tries hard to keep his tone light. "Good news and bad news, Georgie!" he says brightly. "We found it, but..." Maybe there\'s no way to make George lighthearted about writing a $5 million check to Kmart, but Weingartner is trying his damnedest.\n\nDisaster cowboys barely existed a decade ago. Recovery was basically a local, two-call affair: After your store or home was totaled by windstorm or fire, you called your Uncle Lou in construction and your insurance agent to pay him. Rebuilding work was regional, unpredictable, and little different--in terms of tools and skills--from any other contracting job. It was hard to imagine making a full-time living at it.\n\nBut in the early 1990s, two parallel influences converged in something of an industrial big bang that not only brought forth the masters of disasters but also allowed them to thrive. The first part of the bang was Hurricane Andrew. It slammed into Miami and southern Florida on August 24, 1992, then roared northwest along the Louisiana coast. Forty people were killed, 82,000 businesses were damaged, and some 100,000 residents of Dade County alone left for good. About three million addresses were left without power, meaning that in addition to property and loss of life compensation, insurers were on the hook for daily interruption-of-business payouts until the lights came on.\n\nBy the time the dust settled, Andrew had become the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history, racking up some $30 billion in property damage. As a tragic footnote it would have been bad enough, but even more troubling, it seemed part of an ominously accelerating trend. Since 1970, the number of super-severe, Category 4 and 5 hurricanes in the North Atlantic has shot up 56%, according to a new study funded by the National Science Foundation. The authors of the study keep their language conscientiously nonalarmist, but at one point, even they call the spike "rather astonishing."\n\nYou can imagine what that\'s meant for the insurance industry. "Global weather-related losses in recent years have been trending upward much faster than population, inflation, or insurance penetration, and faster than non-weather-related events," reports Evan Mills, a staff scientist in Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\'s Environmental Energy Technologies Division, in the August 2005 issue of Science. According to Mills\'s figures, insurance companies paid out nearly $100 billion for natural disasters in the 1990s, nearly four times the weather-related claims handed out in the 1980s.\n\nWhy the sudden surge in wind-related havoc? Environmentalists point to the storm spike as proof of global warming, but whether your meteorological outlook is formed by Fox or NPR, extreme weather events have led to increasingly extreme liability. In 2002, Texas homeowners saw their premiums double after mold damage claims topped $3 billion, and in 2004, seven private insurers in Florida stopped writing new homeowner policies altogether, forcing the state to step in as the second-largest provider.\n\nBut the insurers\' response hasn\'t been limited to jacking up premiums and fleeing high-risk zones. As long as they were going to be writing billions of dollars to construction companies, the carriers wanted to be sure costs were low and the rebuilt structures were erected with as much speed and storm-resistance as possible: No more Uncle Lou. They wanted specialists who would itemize every light socket and guarantee weather-proofed rooftops and fortified foundation walls.\n\nThe carriers also wanted to get those properties dried out ASAP so their clients could get back to work and end those crippling lost-business charges. That\'s where the second half of the bang came in. In the old days, cleaning mold and water out of a house was usually a job for Pine-Sol, a wet-dry vac, and a clawtooth hammer. It could take weeks for a building to dry, and even then, most of the drywall, flooring, ceiling tiles, and roof timbers were too water-weakened or mold-infested to salvage.\n\nBy the early \'90s, though, a new generation of high-powered industrial drying equipment had been created. By artful arrangement of Red Dragon Heaters, air scrubbers, Dri-Eaz LGR Dehumidifiers, and Vortex Axial Fans, a skilled dry-out man could suck a six-story building dry by dawn. And if they could hit the property within the first 48 hours of a soaking, contractors found that they could keep mold to almost zero and save much of the original interior.\n\nRed Dragon Heaters ain\'t cheap to rent though, or easy to use. Miscalculate and you could burn down the house or miss critical pockets of recessed moisture. You couldn\'t just plug in and go for coffee; you had to calculate square footage ratios, figure out proper routes to tentacle tubing into all the rooms, match air movers with dehumidifiers, and determine which walls and floors had to be demolished. To make it pay, you needed to buy the tools and hire the specialists--but who was crazy enough to try making a full-time living from something as unpredictable as weather?\n\nThe next morning, after a night in a rented condo in Perdido Key, Fla., Weingartner is in an uncharacteristically sour mood as Hillebrand drives him to the Mobile, Ala., airport.\n\nHe\'s annoyed that Dynamic\'s lawyers have pulled him out of the heat of the action to meet with the Florida homeowners who still owe him $2.9 million. Meanwhile, he\'s burning cash by the day in Mississippi but can\'t land any work until the adjusters show up. And to cap it off, Hillebrand gets a call during the drive and finds out that their main source of rental equipment, one of the few guys in the region who can supply them with the special VW-size drying units, is planning to rent the equipment to someone else.\n\n"I sent him a $75,000 deposit two weeks ago!" Weingartner explodes.\n\n"Someone else sent him a million," Hillebrand shrugs.\n\nWeingartner starts stabbing out a number on his phone. By the time the supplier answers, he has forced the sales tone back into his voice. "Hey, I\'m not feeling the love here," he says. "Don\'t forget, you can\'t spend that mill. You\'ve got to send it back if they don\'t get the work, and that\'s what I\'m down here doing--getting the work for both of us."\n\nWhen he hangs up, he\'s still disgusted. "We\'re always running on empty," he says. "We get a quarter tank, it\'s gone that afternoon. It\'s horrible to live that way. Every minute you spend chasing your money or chasing your tail, that\'s a minute you\'re not building your business."\n\nHe\'s still in this black mood when the phone rings. Hillebrand answers, laconic as ever, and Weingartner continues staring out the window.\n\n"Hey, Ed...did you hear me?" Hillebrand is saying.\n\n"What\'s that?" Weingartner asks, jolted back.\n\n"It\'s Jamie. George just called--he\'s got two apartment complexes for us. Something like 180 buildings need their roofs tarped. The manager is waiting for us. It\'s a lock."\n\n"Get out!" Weingartner says. "What else did George say? Can I sell them drying and demo work?"', 'title': 'Hurricane Chasing with Inc. 500 CEOHurricane Chasing with Inc. 500 CEO', 'url': 'https://www.inc.com/magazine/20051101/disaster-cowboys.html', 'keywords': ['disaster', 'hes', 'million', 'adjusters', 'insurance', '500', 'weingartner', 'way', 'ceo', 'ceohurricane', 'hillebrand', 'work', 'hurricane', 'job', 'chasing'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'He spirals an arm over his head, signaling his colleagues in the armored trucks to spread and let us through.\nEd Weingartner started Dynamic Restoration in 1994, after he spent a weekend hanging out with his buddy Fred Gunther at the Daytona 500.\n"You can earn $12 million to $20 million on one hurricane, easy."\n"Someone else sent him a million," Hillebrand shrugs.\nEvery minute you spend chasing your money or chasing your tail, that\'s a minute you\'re not building your business."', 'date': 1130803200}, {'text': "The growth is being driven by several factors. First, Boynton Beach has more developable land than many other already-filled-to-the-brim South Florida municipalities. Another key: Builders are choosing not to make it an exclusively high-end locale. A home in a new development can still occasionally be had for under $350,000, increasingly a rarity in Palm Beach County, where Boynton sits.\n\nBoynton also has a measure of Hollywood fame, thanks to the 2005 release of “The Boynton Beach Club,” a Susan Seidelman film about the romantic lives of a group of retirees. But even if you don’t find love in Boynton, you can find a good bagel — there’s a large Jewish population. And if you’re an ex-New Yorker, you can find fellowship among the countless Big Apple expatriates who now call Boynton Beach home or, at least, second home.\n\n“You walk around,” said Rita Buchner, a retired schoolteacher from Long Island who moved to Boynton eight years ago, “and all you meet are people from the same area you used to live.”\n\nThe Scene\n\nBoynton Beach is really two towns in one. In the city’s incorporated section, all to the east, it’s more about the water — Boynton extends to the Intracoastal Waterway, which separates the mainland from the beach, and through to the Atlantic Ocean, even though most of the oceanfront land in the Boynton area belongs to smaller municipalities, including Ocean Ridge and Gulf Stream. (Boynton does, however, have its own well-maintained beach, with discounted parking for city residents.)\n\nDevelopment is happening in and near the water, with Marina Village a prime example. The city hopes to improve on its seaside-town character even as it adds a splash of urban sophistication. “Boynton still has a lot of that Old Florida charm,” said Lisa Bright, who heads the Boynton Beach Community Redevelopment Agency.\n\nJust visit the marina that’s home to two of the city’s most popular open-air restaurants — Two Georges and Banana Boat — and you’ll see what Ms. Bright means. This is very much the Sunshine State that Jimmy Buffett immortalized in “Margaritaville”: a sunny spot with a kick-back attitude. (And Two Georges, by the way, makes a mean frozen margarita.)\n\nThe other Boynton is a few miles west — the unincorporated section that’s both a bedroom community for middle-class families and a haven for active, social-minded retirees and seasonal residents. And this is suburban South Florida, with a decidedly New York and Jewish accent. There are a handful of synagogues in the area as well as the Hochman Jewish Community Center, whose membership has grown by more than 70 percent since it opened eight years ago. Indeed, a 2006 study by two local Jewish federations showed that Boynton had the fastest-growing Jewish population in Palm Beach County, which is home to the country’s fourth-largest Jewish community.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“Jewish people thrive on being surrounded by Jewish people,” said Rabbi Geoffrey Botnick of Temple Torah in Boynton Beach. He said the city’s population revels in hearing “Yiddish thrown around” and eating traditional Jewish foods. “It adds to the texture,” he said.\n\nBetween these two Boyntons are neighborhoods of older homes as well as a mostly commercial strip — Congress Avenue — of shops and restaurants. The latter is where the Renaissance Commons project is taking root. Jim Comparato, president of Compson Associates, Renaissance’s developer, said that when completed, the project will give the city a focal point, with particular emphasis on fine dining.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In the retirement communities, often called “active adult” communities — in keeping with the more youth-oriented outlook of today’s seniors — there’s plenty to do without venturing beyond the gates. Activities range from seeing shows in the clubhouse theater (many Vegas-style entertainers still play the condo circuit) to attending fund-raising events for charitable organizations.\n\nThere’s the convenience factor, too: whatever Boynton is missing can be found within a 30-minute drive, from the museums and concert halls of Palm Beach and West Palm Beach to the ritzy shopping of Boca Raton. “You’re in the middle of everything,” said Barbara Resnick, another retired schoolteacher from the New York area — Rockland County — who moved to Boynton.\n\nCons\n\nBoynton may eventually have that downtown of its dreams, but right now, it still feels like the classic example of a city with no “there” there. The strip-mall-filled terrain can be more than a little off-putting to city dwellers who favor pedestrian-friendly streets. And if you’re looking for culture, good luck: the closest thing you may find within the city is the occasional bar band entertaining the crowds at the Banana Boat.\n\nAnother negative: Given that many of Boynton’s newest residents are flocking to the unincorporated western area, the Beach in the city’s name is a bit of a misnomer.\n\nOh, and there is that small meteorological phenomenon known as hurricane season. Hurricanes Frances and Jeanne (both 2004) and Wilma (2005) caused considerable damage. This August, Hurricane Ernesto had weakened to tropical-storm status by the time it struck.\n\nThe Real Estate Market\n\nWhile the rest of the South Florida housing market has been in a profound slump after years of growth, Boynton has held its own, local real estate agents say. That means, of course, that the city is no longer the bargain it once was.\n\nIn the new developments — particularly those by GL Homes — prices can start as low as $309,900, according to Mark Meeske, GL’s vice president for planning in its Florida division. But at Canyon Springs, a family-oriented GL community, they can go for $1 million or more.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs for new condos to the east, there’s often less sticker shock (but often less living space, too). Prices for a one-bedroom at the San Raphael development within the Renaissance Commons project start around $235,000, according to the sales office.\n\nResales can be cheaper, but if you want anything near the water, expect to pay a lot, said Barbara Barlage, an agent with ReMax Direct in Boynton Beach. A single-family home “with a peek” of the Intracoastal can easily run above $1 million, she said.\n\nLay of the Land\n\nPOPULATION 66,885, according to a 2005 Census Bureau estimate.\n\nSIZE 16 square miles.\n\nWHO’S BUYING Retirees from the New York area looking for a winter or year-round South Florida residence. Middle-class families within South Florida are also moving to Boynton Beach, attracted by the relatively affordable housing.\n\nGETTING THERE Boynton is about a 20-minute drive from Palm Beach International Airport in West Palm Beach.
