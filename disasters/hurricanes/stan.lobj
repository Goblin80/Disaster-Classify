The death toll in Louisiana stands at 972 – much lower than the 10,000 which had been feared. Some people are still unaccounted for.\n\nHurricane Rita, which lashed the Gulf coast in late September, was one of the most intense hurricanes for decades. It caused massive property destruction, but a relatively small number of deaths were attributed to the storm – some of which were caused by the evacuation itself.\n\nMeanwhile, tropical depression Tammy is dwindling in strength over the southeastern US.

Panabaj, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) west of Guatemala City, was declared a danger zone Tuesday because of health hazards, including the threat of more mudslides. A Spanish volunteer rescue group surveyed the scene Monday and said there was nothing else it could do. The remnants of Hurricane Stan, which hit the Mexican coast last week, combined with the normal Central American rainy season to send rivers of mud flowing down the central Guatemalan highlands. The heavy rains affected 20 of Guatemala\'s 22 provinces as well as other parts of Central America. Officials said at least 500 people have been killed in Guatemala. A fresh landslide in the west of the country was reported to have killed nearly 40 more people Monday. The United Nations issued a "flash appeal" Monday for about $22 million in aid for Guatemala, saying "entire villages have been swept away" by landslides numbering more than 900. UNICEF, the U.N. children\'s aid agency, said Tuesday it is rushing emergency relief supplies to communities in Central America and Mexico. "The demographics of the affected areas suggest that more than a third of the victims of this tragedy are children," said regional director Nils Kastberg. UNICEF said the rains left nearly 500,000 people homeless from southern Mexico to El Salvador, prompting some to call it the region\'s worst disaster since Hurricane Mitch in 1998. The organization said it is seeking almost $6 million for relief in Guatemala and El Salvador and has diverted funds from its regular development programs in the affected countries. Relief picks up Relief operations began to kick into high gear Monday after a break in the weather allowed boats and helicopters to carry aid to Guatemalan villages cut off for days by the flooding and mudslides. A good part of the country is at risk of a food shortage, said Eduardo Secaira, the country\'s international aid coordinator. "The problem is that the south coast is also in bad shape, so basic crops like corn and rice are gone," Secaira said. "I\'m concerned that this shortage could last several weeks. " The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Monday "preliminary estimates indicate that damage to national agriculture will surpass $400 million." "The availability of food will be curtailed in the short-term," OCHA said in a written statement. Private helicopters delivered food Monday to Santiago, and improved weather allowed boats to cross Lake Atitlan, a popular tourist destination, to take supplies to communities on the opposite side. Residents of villages on the far shore hurriedly distributed whatever aid they could get. The United States and Mexico have dispatched helicopters to assist in the relief efforts. Army Gen. John Craddock, chief of the U.S. military\'s Southern Command, visited Guatemala City on Monday to coordinate efforts with government officials there. "They were well prepared and they have done a very good job," Craddock told CNN. Adam Ereli, deputy spokesman for the U.S. State Department, said Tuesday the United States has provided more than $250,000 in relief supplies to Guatemala, including hygiene kits, blankets, drinking water and fuel. "Southern Command has delivered eight helicopters to assist Guatemala in search and rescue assistance in priority areas," he said. "They are also preparing to provide medical equipment and equipment for rebuilding bridges in Guatemala." Tens of thousands of Guatemalans have been displaced, and local authorities are concerned that the food crisis could become a medical crisis. "We have many people who are still recovering physically, but we need three things: water, more medicine and a general plan to prevent infections in the future," said Dr. Francisco Mendes Puac, a physician for the U.S.-based CARE International. In El Salvador, the situation was complicated by the eruption of one of the country\'s largest volcanoes. The United States has given El Salvador $100,000 in aid, said Ereli, "to meet the needs of people who are in shelters as a result of severe flooding as well as volcanic eruptions." CARE said Guatemala and El Salvador had heavy infrastructure damage, with some main roads blocked by landslides and low-lying areas cut off by flooding. The aid group\'s staff said Monday that areas in southern and western Guatemala had no electricity or clean water. The director of OCHA\'s New York office, Ed Tsui, told reporters Monday some people were not willing to give the Guatemalan army access to areas due to its past activities in the nation\'s civil war, which ended in 1996.

Poor and vulnerable people are usually the worst hit.\n\nWHO/C. Black The Asian earthquake on 8 October killed 73 000 people and seriously injured 70 000 more.\n\nTsunamis, hurricanes and typhoons, earthquakes, locusts and now the threat of a flu pandemic. Will 2005 be remembered as the year of natural disasters?\n\nThe year 2005 saw the aftermath of the 26 December 2004 earthquake and tsunami waves in Asia, hurricanes in central and north America, notably Katrina, which triggered flooding in the US city of New Orleans, and the 8 October earthquake in Pakistan and India. The year also saw famine after crops were destroyed by locusts in Niger.\n\nVirtually unnoticed by the outside world was tiny El Salvador where the country’s highest volcano, Ilamatepec, erupted on 1 October, displacing more than 7500 people and killing two. A few days later Hurricane Stan swept through and killed about 70 people with floods and mudslides.\n\nFrom January to October 2005, an estimated 97 490 people were killed in disasters globally and 88 117 of them in natural disasters, according to the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED), a WHO Collaborating Centre that operates a global disaster database in Belgium. According to CRED, the number of natural disasters — floods, windstorms, droughts and geological disasters — recorded since 1900 have increased and the number of people affected by such disasters has also increased since 1975.\n\nIs this as bad as it gets, or could it get worse? Why do natural disasters appear to be increasingly frequent and increasingly deadly?\n\nToday’s disasters stem from a complex mix of factors, including routine climate change, global warming influenced by human behaviour, socioeconomic factors causing poorer people to live in risky areas, and inadequate disaster preparedness and education on the part of governments as well as the general population.\n\nSome disasters experts reject the term “natural disasters, arguing that there is almost always a man-made element.\n\n“I don’t like to use the term ‘natural disasters’,” said Dr Ciro Ugarte, Regional Advisor for Emergency Preparedness and Disaster Relief with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) in Washington DC, explaining that natural disasters would not have such a devastating effect on people’s lives if they were not exposed to such risks in the first place.\n\nNatural phenomena do not always generate human disasters. Ugarte noted that in 2005, several earthquakes that struck in South America were of a higher magnitude than the one that devastated northern Pakistan and parts of India in October, but these hit sparsely populated areas and therefore caused less damage. The same goes for several tsunamis in 2005 which were not deemed “disasters” because they didn’t endanger anyone, Ugarte said.\n\nNatural phenomena are likely to affect more people because Earth’s population has increased. According to the United Nations Population Fund, this stands at about 6.5 billion people and is projected to reach 9.1 billion people in 2050.\n\nMarko Kokic, spokesperson for WHO’s Health Action in Crisis department, said that some communities are more vulnerable to the effects of natural disasters than 100 years ago because of ecological degradation. He said that, for example, when tropical storms hit the Caribbean in September 2004, there was nothing to stop storm waters gathering and wreaking devastation in Haiti because of deforestation.\n\n“We need to tackle the underlying issues, such as poverty and inequity,” Kokic said, adding: “In many countries, people cut down trees because wood is the cheapest fuel”.\n\nDisasters are also a consequence of development and industrialization. In Europe, experts believe that countries such as France and Germany are more adversely affected by floods today because major rivers, such as the Rhine, have been straightened to ease commercial traffic.\n\nGlobal warming as well as routine, cyclical climate changes are causing a higher number of strong hurricanes in the Caribbean, meteorologists say. Add to that the increasing number of people living in areas such as coastlines, in substandard housing and the destruction in a crisis of essential infrastructure, such as hospitals, and you have the potential for more devastating disasters than a few decades ago.\n\nThere have always been disasters. The bubonic plague wiped out more than 25 million people, or 37% of Europe’s population, in the 1300s. More recently, the 1918–19 flu pandemic killed between 20 and 40 million people worldwide. One of the earliest recorded disasters, the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD, buried the ancient Roman city of Pompeii killing about 10 000 people. Today, two million people live within its possible range, illustrating one major difference between then and now.\n\nAbout 75 disasters were reported globally in 1975, according to CRED. In 2000 the figure peaked at 525 and dropped to just under 400 in 2004. By far the highest number of fatalities — about 450 000 — occurred in 1984. In 2004 nearly 300 000 died in disasters, but the number of people affected has soared since 1975 with about 600 million people affected by disasters of all kinds in 2002.\n\nSo complex and intertwined are the factors behind these disasters that some experts believe the most practical approach to preparedness may be to focus on reducing the risks rather than factors behind the risks.\n\nDave Paul Zervaas, regional coordinator for Latin America and the Caribbean at the United Nations’ International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR), argued that preparation should focus on making people less vulnerable to disasters.\n\n“We think it’s much more important now to look at vulnerabilities, because you have factors you can control,” Zervaas said. “You can work to lower vulnerability [to disasters].”\n\nHurricane Katrina in the United States is a good example, Zervaas said. A number of factors contributed to the damage and loss of life. The storm was huge. It struck a city whose levees had not been maintained or strengthened for years, and government agencies’ response to the emergency was at first inadequate.\n\nIn Central America storms such as hurricanes Mitch and Stan have wrought damage with rain and landslides rather than wind. “The poverty issue and the social inequity situation have not become much better in most places,” said Zervaas, adding that migration to cities conspires with a lack of urban planning to put people in danger.\n\nClearly, climate change — whether helped by human behaviour or not — is playing a role. Hurricane experts say the world is in the midst of a routine, cyclical climate change that causes the Caribbean to heat up, increasing the frequency of powerful storms. The effect of this is greater than that of global warming, according to Stanley Goldenberg, a meteorologist at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Miami.\n\nWhile earthquakes represent some of the most devastating disasters in recent years, these are diminishing in strength compared with earlier times, Ugarte said. Nowadays an earthquake with a magnitude of 8, 9 or 10 on the Richter scale is rare, the one in south Asia in October 2005 was 7.6, Ugarte said, adding: “But yes, we are seeing a lot of damage. You will probably find more damage in the future for phenomena that are less in magnitude than in previous years.”\n\nExperts agree that the poor are disproportionately hit. “In several of these countries, the poor people are looking for spaces to build their houses or their communities [and] they find spaces that are not already used,” Ugarte said. “And those spaces that are not already used are usually the spaces at higher risk for natural phenomena. There’s a huge relationship between this kind of damage and poverty.”\n\nFor this reason financial services play a role in both prevention, and damage limitation and recovery. A report entitled, Climate change futures: health ecological and economic dimensions, published in November 2005 assesses the risks generated by climate change. One of several scenarios “would involve blows to the world economy sufficiently severe to cripple the resilience that enables affluent countries to respond to catastrophes,” according to the report, which was published by the Center for Health and Global Environment at the Harvard Medical School and sponsored by reinsurance company Swiss Re and the United Nations Development Programme. While it is important to encourage people, governments and companies to buy insurance, not everyone can afford it or see the need.\n\nMicrofinancing is another avenue, giving poor people the means to improve their economic situation so that a disaster does not hit them as hard as it would otherwise, and also by lending them money to use in recovering from it.\n\nMany countries are working to improve their disaster preparedness, but more needs to be done, Ugarte said.\n\n“Countries are now better prepared in comparison to 1970,” he said. “But now the level of preparation and risk reduction that you need is huge in comparison to that year.”\n\nThe Michoacan earthquake in Mexico in 1985 showed that being well prepared was not enough because hospitals in the disaster zone were destroyed. Likewise, in Grenada Hurricane Ivan damaged and disrupted much of the Caribbean island’s health system, making it difficult for health workers to respond to the needs generated by the hurricane.\n\nPAHO has expanded its programmes to focus not only on preparedness but also on mitigation. This involves reducing secondary deaths and destruction that can occur in the aftermath of a disaster, and implementing building codes that require hospitals, schools, military bases other vital structures to be built to withstand such disasters.\n\nMany countries say they can’t afford more preparation, but some measures are simple and can be inexpensive, such as a tsunami warning system, Ugarte said. “But from there to Banda Aceh, that is another step,” Ugarte said, referring to the capital of the Indonesian province that was worst hit by the earthquake and tsunami of December 2004. “And from Banda Aceh to all the little communities on the coast, that’s another issue. That last link of the chain is not in place. And that is the system that we need to build.”\n\nDisaster experts say early warning systems and education are essential to prevent and mitigate against the effects of natural disasters. In its World disasters report 2005, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies notes that a simple phone call saved thousands of lives when the giant tsunami waves hit India in 2004. A fisherman’s son named Vijayakumar Gunasekaran, who lives in Singapore, heard about the tsunami early on the radio and phoned relatives living on the east coast of India. Following his warning, all 3630 residents evacuated their village there before the waves arrived.\n\nTheresa Braine, Mexico City.', 'title': 'Was 2005 the year of natural disasters?', 'url': 'http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/84/1/news10106/en/', 'keywords': ['disaster', 'number', 'hit', 'health', 'natural', '2005', 'ugarte', 'factors', 'disasters', 'damage'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Was 2005 the year of natural disasters?\nWill 2005 be remembered as the year of natural disasters?\nFrom January to October 2005, an estimated 97 490 people were killed in disasters globally and 88 117 of them in natural disasters, according to the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED), a WHO Collaborating Centre that operates a global disaster database in Belgium.\nAccording to CRED, the number of natural disasters — floods, windstorms, droughts and geological disasters — recorded since 1900 have increased and the number of people affected by such disasters has also increased since 1975.\nSome disasters experts reject the term “natural disasters, arguing that there is almost always a man-made element.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'Local officials ordered visitors out of the Keys yesterday even as thousands of others were evacuated from low-lying areas in a 1,000-kilometre swath covering Cuba, Belize, Honduras, Jamaica, Haiti and the Cayman Islands.

"People should take this hurricane very seriously."

Wilma was on a curving course that would carry it through the narrow channel between Cuba and Mexico tomorrow, possibly within a few kilometres of Cancun and Cozumel. In the coastal state of Quintana Roo - which includes Cancun - officials ordered the evacuation of four low-lying islands, including the popular tourist destination of Isla Mujeres, offshore from Cancun. They also closed the popular cruise ship port on the island of Cozumel.\n\n"This is getting very powerful, very threatening," President Vicente Fox said of the hurricane. Hundreds of schools in Quintana Roo were ordered closed today and tomorrow, and many will be used as storm shelters. Storm surges of 2 to 3 metres were predicted for the coast if Wilma makes landfall there.\n\nPredictions differed on where the hurricane would go and how strong it would be when it reaches US shores; though some weakening was expected by today, the "potential for large loss of life is with us," said Max Mayfield, director of the US National Hurricane Centre in Miami, Florida. "This is one of those cases where we have a tremendous amount of uncertainty," said Mayfield. Referring to Wilma\'s explosive two-day growth from tropical storm to a "potentially catastrophic" category five hurricane, Mayfield said "this is one of the most perplexing storms we have had to deal with" this year.\n\nYesterday, tourists packed Cancun\'s airport even though skies were still partly sunny, looking for flights home or to other resorts. Heavy rain, high winds and rough seas pounded coastal areas of Honduras yesterday, knocking out power to some towns, forcing the evacuation of coastal villages and closure of two Caribbean ports.\n\nFour fishermen were reported missing at sea and about 500 US and European tourists were moved to safe locations at hotels on the Bay Islands. The head of Haiti\'s civil protection agency, Maria Alta Jean-Baptiste, said that at least 12 people had died in rain and landslides since Monday. At least 2,000 Haitian families had been forced from flooded homes. Cuban authorities suspended classes in the threatened western province of Pinar del Rio and prepared to evacuate tourists from campgrounds and low-lying areas, according to Granma, the Communist Party daily.\n\nHeavy rains in the island\'s eastern province of Granma forced the evacuations of more than 1,000 people. Jamaica, where heavy rains have fallen since Sunday, closed almost all schools and 350 people were living in shelters.

In 2004, by contrast, more than 60 percent of the total natural disaster deaths were caused by the tsunami in the Indian Ocean.\n\nSo far, the distribution of natural disasters for 2005 is similar to that of 2004, said Debarati Guha-Sapir, director of the Center for Research on Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) in Brussels, Belgium. However, Guha-Sapir cautioned that it is still premature to make direct comparisons between the two years, noting that the Dec. 6 tsunami that struck Indonesia and which killed 130,000 people.\n\nOther natural disasters for 2005 that have resulted in a major loss of life include:\n\nAn 8.7 magnitude earthquake that struck Indonesia on March 28, killing more than 1,600 people.\n\nHurricane Katrina, which struck the Gulf Coast in late August, killing more than 1,200 people.\n\nHurricane Stan, which triggered mudslides in countries throughout South America that killed a reported 1,153 people when it made landfall Oct. 4.\n\nHurricane Katrina, which caused an estimated $200 billion dollars in damage, is the costliest natural disaster so far this year. It is also the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history.\n\nAll of these numbers pale greatly in comparison to deaths caused every year by war, famine and communicable diseases.\n\nDisasters increasing\n\nAlong with the Office of US Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), CRED maintains an emergency disaster database called EM-DAT. An event is categorized as a natural disaster if it kills 10 or more people or leaves at least 100 people injured, homeless, displaced or evacuated. An event is also included in the database if a country declares it a natural disaster or if requires the country to make a call for international assistance.\n\nAccording to the EM-DAT, the total natural disasters reported each year has been steadily increasing in recent decades, from 78 in 1970 to 348 in 2004.\n\nGuha-Sapir said that a portion of that increase is artificial, due in part to better media reports and advances in communications. Another reason is that beginning in the 1980s, agencies like CRED and the US Agency for International Development (USAID) began actively looking for natural disasters.\n\n"Like in medicine, if you go out into a village and look for cases you find much more than if you just sit back and let people come to you when they\'re sick," Guha-Sapir said.\n\nHowever, about two-thirds of the increase is real and the result of rises in so-called hydro-meteorological disasters, Guha-Sapir said. These disasters include droughts, tsunamis, hurricanes, typhoons and floods and have been increasing over the past 25 years. In 1980, there were only about 100 such disasters reported per year but that number has risen to over 300 a year since 2000.\n\nIn contrast, natural geologic disasters, such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, landslides and avalanches have remained steady in recent decades.\n\nWhat\'s going on?\n\nScientists believe the increase in hydro-meteorological disasters is due to a combination of natural and made-made factors. Global warming is increasing the temperatures of the Earth\'s oceans and atmosphere, leading to more intense storms of all types, including hurricanes.\n\nNatural decadal variations in the frequency and intensity of hurricanes are also believed to be a contributing factor, as are large-scale temperature fluctuations in the tropical waters of the Eastern Pacific Ocean, known as El Niño and La Niña.\n\nPeople are also tempting nature with rapid and unplanned urbanization in flood-prone regions, increasing the likelihood that their towns and villages will be affected by flash floods and coastal floods.\n\n"Large land areas are [being] covered with cement so this means the flow of water becomes very strong," Guha-Sapir said. "The runoff from the water can\'t get absorbed by the soil anymore, so it keeps collecting and rushing down, getting heavier and faster, and then you have much bigger floods."\n\nPeople aren\'t just putting themselves at risk for floods, but for natural disasters of all types, including earthquakes and storms like hurricanes and typhoons.\n\nMaking disasters\n\n"As you put more and more people in harms way, you make a disaster out of something that before was just a natural event," said Klaus Jacob, a senior research scientists at Columbia University\'s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.\n\nAccording to the World Bank\'s "Natural Disaster Hotspots: A Global Risk Analysis" report released in March, more than 160 countries have more than a quarter of their populations in areas of high mortality risks from one or more natural disasters. Taiwan was singled out as being the place on Earth most vulnerable to natural disasters, with 73 percent of it\'s land and population exposed to three or more threats.\n\nThe good news is that the number of deaths from natural disasters has decreased substantially in recent decades thanks to better disaster preparedness and prevention programs. But this statistic is tempered by the fact that more people are being injured, displaced or left homeless.\n\n"If you don\'t die you need care," Guha-Sapir said. "To a certain extent we prevent people from dying but more and more people are affected."', 'title': 'Scientists: Natural Disasters Becoming More Common', 'url': 'https://www.livescience.com/414-scientists-natural-disasters-common.html', 'keywords': ['disaster', 'scientists', 'nature', 'natural', 'struck', 'common', 'guhasapir', 'hurricanes', 'reported', 'recent', 'increasing', 'disasters'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Earth might seem like a more active and dangerous place than ever, given the constant media reports of multiple natural disasters recently.\nIn 2004, by contrast, more than 60 percent of the total natural disaster deaths were caused by the tsunami in the Indian Ocean.\nSo far, the distribution of natural disasters for 2005 is similar to that of 2004, said Debarati Guha-Sapir, director of the Center for Research on Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) in Brussels, Belgium.\nHurricane Katrina, which caused an estimated $200 billion dollars in damage, is the costliest natural disaster so far this year.\nAnother reason is that beginning in the 1980s, agencies like CRED and the US Agency for International Development (USAID) began actively looking for natural disasters.', 'date': 1129539000}, {'text': "Hurricane Wilma slammed into Mexico's famed Caribbean beach resorts yesterday with screaming winds that flattened trees and signposts and trapped thousands of tourists inside cramped shelters.\n\nForecasters warned of catastrophic damage as the eye of the storm moved over the Yucatan Peninsula.\n\nIt was expected to crash into heavily populated southern Florida late yesterday, although forecasters hoped it would have weakened by then.", 'title': 'Florida braces for Wilma after Mexican resorts battered', 'url': 'https://www.smh.com.au/world/florida-braces-for-wilma-after-mexican-resorts-battered-20051023-gdmava.html', 'keywords': ['trapped', 'battered', 'winds', 'mexican', 'yesterday', 'weakened', 'florida', 'wilma', 'tourists', 'resorts', 'braces', 'warned', 'trees', 'thousands', 'yucatan'], 'tags': {'Column 8', 'Socceroos', 'Good Weekend', 'Quizzes', 'Horoscopes', 'Letters', 'For subscribers', 'Editorial', 'Obituaries'}, 'summary': "Hurricane Wilma slammed into Mexico's famed Caribbean beach resorts yesterday with screaming winds that flattened trees and signposts and trapped thousands of tourists inside cramped shelters.\nForecasters warned of catastrophic damage as the eye of the storm moved over the Yucatan Peninsula.\nIt was expected to crash into heavily populated southern Florida late yesterday, although forecasters hoped it would have weakened by then.", 'date': 1130025600}, {'text': 'Tropical Storm Stan received less attention than Hurricane Katrina\n\nIn 2005, emergency aid reached at least $17bn (£8.6bn) -

The Atlantic basin has seen 17 named storms since the season began June 1, and only four are left on the list. What\'s a meteorologist to do if the names run out? Go Greek. Should the Atlantic see more than 21 named storms "additional storms will take names from the Greek alphabet: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and so on," according to the National Hurricane Center Web site. "We only have four names left on the list this year: Stan, Tammy, Vince and Wilma. If we have a fifth storm it would be named Alpha," said Daniel Brown, a meteorologist at the center, which is based in Miami, Florida. At the beginning of each Atlantic storm season, the center publishes a list of 21 storm names. They alternate male and female names in alphabetical order. The letters Q, U, X, Y and Z are skipped because not enough names start with those letters, Brown said. Hurricane Alpha would be a first for the hurricane center. "There was one year in 1933 we actually had 21 storms. That\'s been the most in the Atlantic. However, it was before we started naming storms" Brown said. The National Weather Service started naming storms in 1953 as way to reduce confusion over the latitude-longitude naming method. In 1979 Atlantic male names were included, putting to an end the practice of naming hurricanes only after women. What makes a good storm name? According to the National Weather Service, short, distinctive given names work best. The World Meteorological Organization, a United Nations agency based in Geneva, Switzerland, now maintains lists of names for storm-prone regions around the globe. For the North Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico region, the list covers six years and rotates beginning every seventh year. Names are changed if the storm causes extreme damage and loss of life. Brown said Hurricane Katrina will "absolutely" be retired by the organization. Andrew, the name of the 1992 hurricane that according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration killed 23 people in south Florida and three in the Bahamas and caused $26.5 billion in damage, likewise has been retired.
