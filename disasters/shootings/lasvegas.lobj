It was the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.\n\nPresident Trump called the attack "an act of pure evil" and said the FBI and Department of Homeland Security were working with local authorities in the investigation. Mr. Trump spoke with Nevada\'s governor and the mayor and sheriff of Las Vegas, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. Mr. Trump observed a moment of silence for the victims Monday afternoon and was to travel Wednesday to Las Vegas.\n\nOfficials said Tuesday afternoon that all but three victims had been identified.\n\nThe gunman has been identified as Stephen Craig Paddock, 64, of Mesquite, Nevada. While the investigation into his motives continues, the FBI special agent in charge in Las Vegas, Aaron Rouse, said Monday that investigators had found "no connection with an international terrorist group." Late Monday evening, officials said there were no known threats in the Las Vegas area, according to Las Vegas Asst. Sheriff Todd Fasulo.\n\nResponding to a question from CBS News\' Norah O\'Donnell, Lombardo said video cameras were found both inside and outside the hotel room the gunman used for the shooting. Lombardo said he anticipates Paddock was "looking for anybody coming to take him into custody." Lombardo said he was not aware of any transmissions from the cameras.\n\nA hotel security guard who approached the room during the rampage was shot through the door and wounded in the leg. Lombardo called his actions "heroic."\n\nAs part of the investigation, authorities are evaluating more than 60 body camera videos, along with common space cameras. Based upon the amount of ammunition and evidence found at the scene, police say they believe the incident was a "premeditated" shooting.\n\nLombardo released body cam footage at a Tuesday evening press conference that showed the terror from the scene.\n\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said 47 weapons had been recovered from the hotel room, Paddock\'s residences in Mesquite and Verdi, Nevada. Paddock had devices attached to 12 weapons that enable semiautomatic rifles to mimic fully automatic gunfire, ATF special agent in charge Jill Snyder confirmed. The little-known devices, called "bump stocks," have been around for less than a decade, and Snyder said officials had determined they were legal.\n\nThe device basically replaces the gun\'s shoulder rest with a "support step" that covers the trigger opening. By holding the pistol grip with one hand and pushing forward on the barrel with the other, the shooter\'s finger comes in contact with the trigger. The recoil causes the gun to buck back and forth, "bumping" the trigger. Technically, that means the finger is pulling the trigger for each round fired, keeping the weapon a legal semi-automatic.\n\nAuthorities said loved ones or friends can call 1-800-536-9488 to report anyone missing in the wake of the fatal shooting. Anyone in the Las Vegas area who would like to report information related to the shooting should contact authorities by dialing 311.\n\nDuring a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, authorities announced a GoFundMe account that has been set up to assist the victims of the shooting has surpassed $3.7 million.\n\nCountry music star Jason Aldean was performing Sunday night at the end of the three-day Route 91 Harvest Festival when the gunman opened fire across the street from inside the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. On Tuesday, Aldean canceled his upcoming shows for the weekend.\n\nCBS News/Google Earth\n\nPolice and SWAT teams quickly descended on the concert and the casino, and officers used explosives to get into the hotel room where the suspect was inside, authorities said. Officials said Paddock shot and killed himself before a SWAT team breached the door.\n\nThe shooter: Stephen Paddock\n\nInvestigators are still trying to discern the motive of gunman Stephen Paddock and retrace the steps that led to his deadly rampage.\n\nAuthorities recovered a total of 42 guns belonging to the shooter -- at least 23 firearms were found in his Mandalay Bay hotel suite, Fasulo said Monday evening, and an additional 19 guns were found in a search of his home in Mesquite.\n\nOwners of at least three gun stores in Nevada and Utah said they legally sold a total of six firearms to Paddock, including a reported handgun, two shotguns and three rifles, CBS News justice and homeland security correspondent Jeff Pegues reports.\n\n"He was visiting all the local firearm shops, is what he told everybody," said Chris Michel, owner of Dixie GunWorx in St. George, Utah.\n\nLombardo said authorities found explosives and several thousand rounds of ammo along with some electronic devices that police were still evaluating Monday night.\n\nEarlier, officials said they discovered ammonium nitrate, an explosives component, in his vehicle.\n\nPaddock brought the weapons into the hotel himself and used "a device similar to a hammer" to break the window before he began firing, Lombardo said.\n\nAt casinos over the weekend, he used the ID of his girlfriend, 62-year-old Marilou Danley, who had worked at a Reno casino for three years, Pegues reports.\n\nAt a press conference Tuesday, Lombardo said Danley was in the Philippines. She was not in Las Vegas at the time of the shooting, but Lombardo described her as a person of interest in the investigation, and said investigators have questions for her when she returns from overseas.\n\nA law enforcement source said authorities have located her, but it was unclear how cooperative she has been, CBS News producers Pat Milton and Andy Triay report. Late Tuesday evening, a U.S. official told CBS News that Danley had arrived back in the U.S. and was met at the airport in Los Angeles by FBI agents.\n\nIt was still unclear whether she had agreed to be interviewed by authorities and, if so, when that interview might take place. The Las Vegas police say Danley is still considered a "person of interest."\n\nRecords show that Paddock had been married twice, in 1977 and in 1985, to different women in Southern California. Both marriages ended in divorce, although it was unclear when.\n\nCBS News has confirmed that Paddock was employed with the U.S. government at the Postal Service and IRS over a span of 10 years. Paddock worked off and on for the USPS from 1975-1976, and full-time a letter carrier from 1976-1978, according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. He worked for the IRS from 1978-1984 and worked in auditing for the Defense Contract Audit Agency from 1984-85.\n\n\n\nLombardo said Paddock was not known to law enforcement in Las Vegas.\n\nHis brother, Eric Paddock, told reporters Monday that the gunman was a multimillionaire who made much of his money investing in real estate. He said his brother was an accountant for many years and he wasn\'t aware of him having financial difficulties. In fact, he said in a second news conference at his Florida home on Tuesday, Stephen Paddock had provided money to help family members including their elderly mother live comfortable lives.\n\n"Steve took care of the people he loved. He helped make me and my family wealthy. He\'s the reason I was able to retire. This is the Steve we know, we knew. The people he loved and took care of," Eric Paddock said. He also described his brother as "intelligent" and "successful."\n\nA law enforcement source confirmed Tuesday that investigators are looking into whether Stephen Paddock may have planned an earlier attack at a concert in Las Vegas in September, CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton reports. The source said investigators are looking at whether he may have first had his sights on the "Life is Beautiful" festival on Sept 22 to Sept. 24. This year\'s three-day festival featured numerous concerts including Chance The Rapper.\n\nThe source, who was briefed on the police investigation, said Paddock had apparently tried to get a room at the Ogden condo hotel and another hotel in downtown Las Vegas, but apparently the specific suites he requested were booked. The source speculated that Paddock may had been seeking rooms that were strategically located to launch an attack.\n\nThe U.S. Homeland Security Department says there is no "specific credible threat" involving other public venues in the U.S. after the shooting.\n\nThe Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) claimed on Monday that Paddock had recently converted to Islam and was acting on behalf of the group, but offered no evidence. U.S. officials dispute that claim, telling CBS News there are no signs that Paddock had ties to radical Islamic groups or showed signs of being radicalized.\n\nThe shooting\n\nCountry star Jason Aldean was in the middle of a song when the shots came rapidly: Pop-pop-pop-pop. Video of the shooting then showed Aldean stopping and the crowd getting quiet as if they were unsure of what had just happened. The gunman paused and then fired another volley of muzzle flashes from the gold glass casino as more victims fell to the ground while others fled in panic. Some said they hid behind concession stands and other crawled under parked cars.\n\nAuthorities say Paddock fired at the crowd for nine minutes.\n\nGail Davis, who was at the Las Vegas outdoor country music concert Sunday night, witnessed the terrifying scene.\n\n"We went there to see Jason Aldean," she said. "We were standing, like, maybe halfway up. He came on and about 20 to 10, he sang about five songs and all of a sudden we heard about three or four little pop, pop, pops, and everybody looked around and said, \'Oh, it\'s just firecrackers.\' And then we heard pop, pop, pop, and it just kept going and going, and my husband said, \'That\'s not firecrackers. That sounds like a semi-automatic rifle.\' And then everybody started screaming and started to run.\n\n"I looked over to my right where this girl had been standing right beside me, and she had fallen -- first, she stood there and she grabbed her stomach and she looked at her hands and her hands were all bloody, and she was wearing, like, a little crop top and, you know, blue jean shorts and cowboy boots, and she looked at her hands and her hands were bloody, and she just kind of screamed and she just fell back."\n\nKodiak Yazzie, 36, said the music stopped temporarily when the first shots began and the tune even started up again before the second round of pops sent the performers ducking for cover and fleeing the stage.\n\n"It was the craziest stuff I\'ve ever seen in my entire life," Yazzie said. "You could hear that the noise was coming from west of us, from Mandalay Bay. You could see a flash-flash-flash-flash."\n\nChris Bethel, who was staying two floors down from the 32nd floor, told CBS News\' John Blackstone "the walls and the windows were vibrating. You could feel the compression, the sound."\n\n"I haven\'t had any sleep. I close my eyes -- I relive the moment," Bethel said.\n\nThousands in the crowd fled, or tried to. Monique Dumas from British Columbia, Canada, said she was at the concert, six rows from the stage when she thought she heard a bottle breaking, and then a burst of popping sounds that sounded like fireworks. She said as she made her way out it was "organized chaos" as everyone fled. "It took four to five minutes and all that time there was gunfire."\n\n"It\'s a devastating time," Sheriff Lombardo said.\n\nPolice shut down the usually busy Las Vegas Boulevard and authorities across the state and federal ranks converged onto the scene as dozens of ambulances ferried those struck by gunfire. Nearby Interstate 15 and flights at McCarran International Airport were briefly closed. Hospital emergency rooms were jammed with victims delivered by ambulance. Others loaded the wounded into their cars and drove them to hospitals.\n\nJose Baggett, 31, of Las Vegas, said he and a friend were in the lobby of the Luxor hotel-casino -- directly north of the festival -- when people began to run, almost like in a stampede. He said people were crying and as he and his friend started walking away minutes later, they encountered police checkpoints where officers were carrying shotguns and assault rifles.\n\n"There were armored personnel vehicles, SWAT vehicles, ambulances, and at least a half-mile of police cars," Baggett said.\n\nAmong those killed were two off-duty police officers who were attending the concert. Two on-duty officers were wounded, including one who underwent surgery and was upgraded to stable condition early Monday, police said.\n\nHours after the shooting, Aldean posted on Instagram that he and his crew were safe and said the shooting was "beyond horrific."\n\n"It hurts my heart that this would happen to anyone who was just coming out to enjoy what should have been a fun night," Aldean said.\n\nPoliticians react\n\nThe shooting prompted reactions from politicians on both sides of the aisle in Washington and around the country.\n\nPresident Trump said the nation must stay unified, and that although we "feel such great anger at the senseless murder of our fellow citizens, it is our love that binds us today and always will."\n\n"In moments of tragedy and horror, America comes together as one. And it always has," Mr. Trump said Monday morning at the White House. "Our unity cannot be shattered by evil" and "our bonds cannot be broken by violence."\n\nMr. Trump also issued a proclamation ordering flags be flown at half-staff until sunset Oct. 6. The proclamation covers flags at the White House and all public buildings, military posts, naval stations and naval vessels throughout the U.S. and all territories. It also extends to embassies, military facilities and other sites overseas.\n\nAt the daily White House briefing on Monday afternoon, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said now is not the time to talk about gun control.\n\n"There\'s a time and place for a political debate, but now is the time to unite as a country," Sanders said. She said Mr. Trump is a strong supporter of the Second Amendment.\n\nHouse Majority Whip Steve Scalise says he agrees with Mr. Trump that the shooting was "an act of pure evil."\n\nScalise, a Louisiana Republican, returned to the Capitol last week after he was shot and critically wounded in June as he and fellow Republicans practiced for a congressional baseball game. Scalise said he prays for the victims of the shooting and that the whole nation grieves with their loved ones.\n\nScalise encouraged people across America to stand together in solidarity to support the Las Vegas community, "especially by giving blood and encouraging others to do the same. In the face of unspeakable evil, our whole nation must respond with countless acts of kindness, warmth and generosity."\n\nHowever, other leaders refused to separate the tragedy of the Las Vegas shooting from the contentious issue of guns in America.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said it\'s time for Congress to take action. Murphy, a leading gun-control proponent, said mass shootings had become an "epidemic" in America.\n\n"It is positively infuriating that my colleagues in Congress are so afraid of the gun industry that they pretend there aren\'t public policy responses to this epidemic," he said.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said in a statement: "Today, our nation woke up to news of the worst mass shooting in our history, claiming the lives of at least 58 innocent men and women in Las Vegas. Nearly 12,000 Americans have been killed by guns in 273 mass shootings in 2017 – one for each day of the year."\n\nShe urged House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, to create a Select Committee on Gun Violence to come up with "common sense legislation to help end this crisis."\n\nHowever, action in the Republican-controlled Congress is unlikely.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan ordered flags over the Capitol lowered to half-staff and said "the whole country stands united in our shock, in our condolences and in our prayers."', 'title': 'ATF: Las Vegas shooter had 12 guns modified to mimic automatics – live updates', 'url': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/victims-of-las-vegas-shooting-list-names-latest-update/', 'keywords': ['shooting', 'modified', 'lombardo', 'hotel', 'atf', 'trump', 'automatics', 'shooter', 'updates', 'vegas', 'las', 'cbs', 'authorities', 'mimic', 'live', 'paddock', 'guns', 'gunman'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Mr. Trump observed a moment of silence for the victims Monday afternoon and was to travel Wednesday to Las Vegas.\nLate Monday evening, officials said there were no known threats in the Las Vegas area, according to Las Vegas Asst.\nThe Las Vegas police say Danley is still considered a "person of interest."\nGail Davis, who was at the Las Vegas outdoor country music concert Sunday night, witnessed the terrifying scene.\nHowever, other leaders refused to separate the tragedy of the Las Vegas shooting from the contentious issue of guns in America.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'My fellow Americans. we are joined together today in sadness, shock and grief.

Chase Stevens Las Vegas Review-Journal @csstevensphoto\n\nThe nation awoke Monday to the numbing news that the worst mass shooting in modern American history had ravaged the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nIt was a deadly ambush in a city built as an open invitation to the world.\n\n“I just kept thinking to myself, ‘This isn’t real. This is not happening. This is not real,’” Lisa Schau, of Sacramento, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal near the scene. “I just kept thinking that over and over. And it was.”\n\nBut the staggering carnage — at least 59 dead and 527 injured — brought out the best in Las Vegas Valley residents. They rushed to help the wounded; donated blood, supplies and money; and prayed en masse for victims and their families.\n\nA Mesquite man perched on the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay shot through his corner suite’s windows, then sprayed bullets into a crowd of thousands at an outdoor country music festival late Sunday, just east of the hotel.\n\nIt was confusion, then chaos. Some attendees thought fireworks were ringing out just as Jason Aldean began singing the first few lines of his hit “When She Says Baby” at the Route 91 Harvest festival. But as the rapid-fire shots continued and people began falling, the crowd collectively realized the horror that was happening. And they ran.\n\nFirst responders descended on the scene. Civilians did their part, too, taking truckloads of wounded to local trauma units. The injured were moved in wheelbarrows and on luggage carts, and more than 100 people were treated at University Medical Center alone.\n\nBefore the sun rose Monday, Sheriff Joe Lombardo stood in the dark parking lot of Metropolitan Police Department headquarters, steeling himself as he explained to the public and global news media that the shooter, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, had acted alone.\n\nShortly after, Gov. Brian Sandoval called it a “cowardly, despicable act.”\n\n‘We’re angry’\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Sandoval declared a state of emergency and a public health and medical disaster in Clark County.\n\n“We’re angry. We’re grieving. Confused,” the governor said. “People are hurting.”\n\nLas Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman said the city has a broken heart, “but it has bonded us so tightly.”\n\nVIDEO: Rapid fire from shooter(s) in Las Vegas pic.twitter.com/jgzCTQRUZP — Joel Franco (@OfficialJoelF) October 2, 2017\n\n“We will not be tarnished by this sick, horrible human being,” Goodman said.\n\nAbout an hour after shots first rang out, officers closed in on Paddock’s room, which he checked into on Thursday, Lombardo said. In seconds, Paddock shot through the door, injuring a security guard. Then he turned the gun on himself.\n\nInside, police found scopes and at least 23 firearms. Later, investigators found ammonium nitrate, a chemical compound that can be used in homemade bombs, inside Paddock’s car at Mandalay Bay.\n\nOn the streets below, red-and-blue lights speckled the Strip, drowning out its famous neon. Many who escaped the venue or ran from casinos in the confusion walked aimlessly. Some dragged luggage, others still wore blood-drenched clothing, the color drained from their faces.\n\nAnxious and weary\n\nWhile University Medical Center absorbed the worst of the wounded, Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center quickly became overwhelmed, too.\n\nAbout 12 hours after the ordeal began, Deserie Bohl, 35, sat in the east valley hospital’s small surgical waiting room as her husband underwent surgery. Next to her sat several others, praying and checking their phones. Some paced, looking anxious and weary. The silence was deafening.\n\nOccasionally, a doctor or surgeon would pop in, calling out the name of a patient. Like clockwork, a swarm of loved ones would rush over, huddling to hear the news.\n\nRobert Kyander, of San Bernardino, California, sat in limbo, his head down. His daughter, Lauren, and her boyfriend, Zach, both 21, had been at the festival all weekend. Zach was shot in the back.\n\nHours earlier, the 55-year-old Kyander had been at home, watching the Sunday night news when headlines about the shooting began ticking across his screen.\n\nPanicked, he bolted to Las Vegas. Just before he left, he got a text from Zach:\n\n“Hey this is Zach, I got shot in the back, but I made your daughter run like hell. I am truly sorry I’m not with her, but she is safe with Jodie. Love you both, I’ll keep you updated.”\n\nWhen he got to the hospital, Kyander found Lauren waiting in the lobby. He wrapped her in his arms.\n\n“I didn’t want to let go,” he said. “I’m just so glad my daughter was OK.”\n\nMany others never experienced that relief.\n\nSuspect’s Mesquite home\n\nAs the Las Vegas community hauled itself out of bed to help, collecting water and food for first responders and victims’ families, authorities swarmed the shooter’s Mesquite home.\n\nInside, they found explosives, 19 additional firearms and several thousand rounds of ammunition, the sheriff said.\n\nPolice initially asked the public to help locate Paddock’s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, whom they named as a person of interest. But before dawn, law enforcement had touched base with her and ruled her out as a suspect.\n\nAs of late Monday, Paddock’s motive remained a mystery.\n\nAs the sun began to set, hundreds of Las Vegas locals and tourists gathered at vigils throughout the valley to mourn, weep and share in their disbelief.\n\nIn front of Las Vegas City Hall, sorrowful singing grew into triumphant chants of “Hallelujah” and “Jesus.”\n\nSilverado High School student Ethan Dimayo stood alongside his younger brothers holding a sign that read “We Are Strong, We Are Battle Born.”\n\n“It’s really inspiring to see all these people come out and pray,” he said.\n\nTony Barber heard about the shooting Monday morning. He took his 5-year-old grandson to the vigil.\n\n“It’s important to pay homage and lend support to the city as a whole,” Barber said.\n\nIn the central valley, at the International Church of Las Vegas, faith and community leaders from several different backgrounds comforted a crowd of about 150.\n\nMany attendees sniffled between sermons and speeches from Clark County Commissioners Chris Giunchigliani and Steve Sisolak. One woman sat on the far end of a back-of-the-room bench, a stack of balled-up tissues to her right.\n\n“I think there’s great value in being with community at these times,” said Wendy Kraft, 57, an involved member of the Jewish community. “I’m saddened to my core. … I feel so very helpless.”\n\nContact Rachel Crosby at rcrosby@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-5290.

Upstairs in the Mandalay Bay, halfway up I see the shots coming from Mandalay Bay, halfway up.”\n\n“We have an active shooter — we have an active shooter inside the fairgrounds!”\n\nAt 10:12 p.m., the scale of the attack becomes more clear as an officer, using law-enforcement shorthand for gunshot wounds, reports in an agitated voice: “We have multiple casualties. G.S.W.’s in the medical tent. Multiple casualties!”\n\nBut the confusion over the source of the gunshots continues:\n\n“Shots are coming from Gate 7.”\n\n“We’re in front of Mandalay Bay. We’re trying to see where the shots are coming from. If anyone can advise if they’re coming from Mandalay.”\n\n“It sounds like it’s either Mandalay or Luxor, we cannot tell.”\n\nAt 10:13 p.m., the manhunt begins to focus.\n\n“It’s coming from like the 50th or 60th floor, north of the Mandalay Bay! It’s coming out a window.”\n\n“We’re seeing local flashes in the middle of Mandalay Bay on the north side, kind of on the west tower but towards the center of the casino, like one of the middle floors.”\n\nThe gunman had smashed two windows that have a broad view of the festival ground, the sheriff said later at a news conference.\n\nJohn Locher/Associated Press\n\nEven with pandemonium on the streets, one officer has clearly identified where the shooting is coming from:\n\n“I’m inside the Mandalay Bay on the 31st floor, I can hear the automatic fire coming from one floor ahead, one floor above us.”\n\n“Repeating, just be advised it is automatic fire. Fully automatic fire from an elevated position. Take cover.”\n\n“That is correct, it’s fully automatic fire. I’m right below it.”\n\nOutside, frustration grows.\n\n“We’re taking gunfire. It’s going right over our heads. There’s debris coming over our heads. We’re pinned down here with a bunch of civilians.”\n\n“We can’t worry about victims, we need to snuff the shooter before we have more victims! Anybody have eyes on him, on this shooter?”\n\n“Hey officers, please stay calm, just relax, we’re trying to get this set up.”\n\nBy 10:20 p.m., there are some indications the shooting has stopped, although it is not clear.\n\n“It’s been awhile since we’ve heard any shots. Does anybody have eyes on the shooter?”\n\nA later transmission indicates that the shooting may have ended about 10:25.\n\nAt 10:24 p.m., officers report from the stairwell just outside the gunman’s door.\n\n“I’m on the 32nd floor. The room is going to be 135.”\n\n“It’s room 135 on the 32nd floor. I need the SWAT.”\n\nAt 10:28 p.m., as SWAT teams gather on the 32nd floor and the 29th floor, where there have been erroneous reports of another gunman, an officer says that a hotel security officer has been shot.\n\nThe gunman was at one point in a large suite on the 32nd floor, with windows facing the concert grounds. The diagram below shows the typical floor plan.\n\nBy The New York Times\n\nOver the next 50 minutes, officers secure the floor and ready several SWAT teams.\n\nAt about 11:20 p.m., they explode a door-breaching device, and enter to find the suspect dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The man, who was later identified as Stephen Paddock, 64, had an arsenal of firearms in the room, officials said.\n\nAbout the Hotel\n\nThe Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino anchors the southern tip of a row of luxury hotels on Las Vegas Boulevard known as the Strip.

I mean, when you find out about it, like I said he\'s just a guy who lived in a house in Mesquite and drove down and gambled in Las Vegas.\n\n"When you get a phone call that says your brother, you know, just killed a bunch of people, it\'s like … we\'re shocked, horrified, completely dumbfounded."\n\nThe owner of a gun shop in Mesquite said Paddock bought firearms there and never gave any indication he might have been unstable.\n\nGuns and Guitars general manager Christopher Sullivan said in a statement all necessary background checks and procedures were followed and that Paddock showed no signs of being unfit to buy firearms.\n\nA Utah gun store owner has also said Paddock visited his shop, about a 40-minute drive from Mesquite, and purchased a shotgun.\n\nWhat about the ISIS claim?\n\nUS officials said there was no evidence to support Islamic State\'s claim of responsibility for the attack made through its Amaq news agency.\n\n"The Intelligence Community is aware of the claim of responsibility by a foreign terrorist organisation for the shooting in Las Vegas," CIA spokesman Jonathan Liu said.\n\n"We advise caution on jumping to conclusions before the facts are in."\n\nThe preliminary death toll, which officials said could rise, eclipsed last year\'s massacre of 49 people at an Orlando nightclub by a gunman who pledged allegiance to Islamic State militants.\n\nAustralian authorities are contacting hospitals in Las Vegas to check whether any Australians were admitted after the massacre.\n\nThe Federal Government was not aware of any Australians being killed or injured and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said consular staffing numbers had been boosted in response to the shootings.\n\nShot man \'was asking me for help\'\n\nVideo of the attack showed panicked crowds fleeing as sustained rapid gunfire ripped through the area.\n\n"People were just dropping to the ground. It just kept going on," said Steve Smith, a 45-year-old visitor from Phoenix, Arizona. He said the gunfire went on for an extended period of time.\n\n"Probably 100 shots at a time," Smith said. "It would sound like it was reloading and then it would go again."\n\nAs news of the shooting spread across Las Vegas, crowds formed long lines outside the city\'s blood donation centres to donate blood to the victims.\n\nLas Vegas casinos, nightclubs and shopping draw some 3.5 million visitors from around the world each year and the area was packed with visitors when the shooting broke out shortly after 10pm local time.\n\nA witness who gave her name as Christine was in tears as she told local TV that she saw a man shot in front of her.\n\n"They were trying to take him out and he was all bloody and unconscious," she said. "My friend was helping him out and they got him out, and we ran."\n\nShe said people were hiding wherever they could, including under her car.\n\n"Everyone was telling us to run as fast as you can. There were people hiding under my car for cover," she said. "There was a gentleman who was shot and he was asking me for help."\n\nSome police officers took cover behind their vehicles while others carrying assault rifles ran into the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino.\n\nShooting renews gun debate in US\n\nUS law prohibits possession of newly manufactured machine guns but allows the transfer of the weapons owned before May 1986 if approved by the government.\n\nDespite an outcry among some lawmakers about the pervasiveness of guns in the United States, the massacre, like previous mass shootings, was unlikely to prompt action in Congress.\n\nNevada has some of the most permissive gun laws in the United States. It does not require firearm owners to obtain licenses or register their guns.\n\nThe Second Amendment of the US Constitution protects the right to bear arms, and gun-rights advocates staunchly defend that provision.\n\nMr Trump, a Republican, has been outspoken about his support of the Second Amendment.\n\n"It\'s time for Congress to get off its ass and do something," said US Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, where 26 children and educators were killed in an attack on a school in 2012.\n\nEfforts to pass federal legislation after that attack failed.\n\nGun rights advocates argued that restrictions on legal gun sales would leave law-abiding citizens more vulnerable to attacks by criminals.\n\nThe dead in Las Vegas included one off-duty police officer, Sheriff Lombardo said.\n\nPolice believe man\'s Australian \'companion\' was not involved\n\nSheriff Lombardo said it was believed the shooter acted alone but police initially mounted a search for Ms Danley, who shared Paddock\'s Mesquite home.\n\nMs Danley was later contacted and is currently outside of the US.\n\nSheriff Lombardo said police believed she had no connection to the shooting and it was thought Paddock had been using some of her identification documents.\n\n"We have had a conversation with her and we believe her, at this time, not to be involved. Obviously that investigation will continue." Sherriff Joseph Lombardo said.\n\nA Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesperson said they were "aware of media reports referring to Marilou Danley as an Australian woman in connection with the shooting incident in Las Vegas".\n\n"Given the local authorities are still investigating the incident, we cannot comment further on these reports," the spokesperson said.\n\nReuters/ABC\n\nTopics: law-crime-and-justice, crime, death, terrorism, unrest-conflict-and-war, united-states\n\nFirst posted', 'title': 'Las Vegas shooting: Gunman Stephen Paddock kills 58 people, injures 500 outside Mandalay Bay Hotel', 'url': 'http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-10-03/las-vegas-shooting-mandalay-bay-hotel-stephen-paddock/9009432', 'keywords': ['shooting', 'outside', 'hotel', 'lombardo', 'kills', 'gun', 'las', 'vegas', 'killed', 'danley', 'mandalay', 'stephen', 'paddock', 'mesquite', 'guns', 'injures'], 'tags': {'united-states', 'death', 'unrest-conflict-and-war', 'crime', 'law-crime-and-justice', 'terrorism'}, 'summary': 'Las Vegas shooting: Gunman Stephen Paddock kills 58 people, injures 500 outside Mandalay Bay HotelUpdatedA man armed with at least 23 guns on a high floor of a Las Vegas hotel rained a barrage of bullets on an outdoor country music festival on Sunday, slaughtering 59 people, including himself, in the largest mass shooting in modern US history.\nHe ordered flags lowered to half-mast in a national gesture of mourning and said he would visit Las Vegas on Wednesday.\n"The Intelligence Community is aware of the claim of responsibility by a foreign terrorist organisation for the shooting in Las Vegas," CIA spokesman Jonathan Liu said.\nAustralian authorities are contacting hospitals in Las Vegas to check whether any Australians were admitted after the massacre.\nAs news of the shooting spread across Las Vegas, crowds formed long lines outside the city\'s blood donation centres to donate blood to the victims.', 'date': 1506988800}, {'text': "FOR the past four years, country-music fans have gathered on a 15-acre lot across from the Mandalay Bay Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip for the Route 91 music festival. On October 1st Jason Aldean, a honey-voiced singer from central Georgia, was closing out the festival when a shooter opened fire on the crowd from the 32nd storey of the hotel.

The suspect was Stephen Paddock, a 64-year-old resident of Mesquite, Nevada, a small town about 80 miles north-east of Las Vegas, on the Nevada-Arizona border.\n\nJoe Lombardo, sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, said the shooting was the act of “a solo actor…a lone wolf”. Police found a number of guns in Mr Paddock's hotel room. He appears to have killed at least 58 people and wounded at least 527, making this the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history.\n\nAmerican politicians routinely warn against “politicising” mass shootings. Although they take to the airwaves to discuss airline safety in the wake of a plane crash or security measures after a terrorist attack, discussing gun laws after a lunatic shoots scores of people to death—asking whether, perhaps, the ease of obtaining weapons in America might have something to do with the frequency with which mass murderers kill people with firearms—is understood to somehow be in bad taste. So let’s not mention the massacres at Port Arthur and Dunblane, which prompted Australia and Britain to pass more restrictive gun laws that dramatically reduced the risk of dying by gunshot in both countries.\n\nThis week the House of Representatives could pass the “Hearing Protection Act”, which rolls back restrictions on gun silencers. It was supposed to be taken up in June, but was postponed after a gunman opened fire on a congressional softball game. Separate legislation in the House would allow holders of concealed-carry permits to carry their weapons in other states with more restrictive licensing—effectively gutting state-level concealment restrictions. As Barack Obama said after a married couple slaughtered 14 people in San Bernardino, California with legally bought guns, “We’ve become numb to this…This is a political choice we make to allow this to happen every few months in America.”\n\nUpdate (October 3rd, 12.30pm London time): This piece has been amended to reflect an increase in the number of those killed and wounded.\n\nCorrection (October 5th, 10am London time): The headline figure has been revised down from 59 to 58 to exclude the shooter.", 'title': 'At least 58 people are killed and 527 injured in a shooting in Las Vegas', 'url': 'https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2017/10/02/at-least-58-people-are-killed-and-527-injured-in-a-shooting-in-las-vegas', 'keywords': ['shooting', 'weapons', 'hotel', '58', 'mass', 'gun', 'las', 'shooter', 'killed', 'injured', 'vegas', 'suspect', 'restrictive', '527'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'FOR the past four years, country-music fans have gathered on a 15-acre lot across from the Mandalay Bay Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip for the Route 91 music festival.\nThe suspect was Stephen Paddock, a 64-year-old resident of Mesquite, Nevada, a small town about 80 miles north-east of Las Vegas, on the Nevada-Arizona border.\nJoe Lombardo, sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, said the shooting was the act of “a solo actor…a lone wolf”.\nHe appears to have killed at least 58 people and wounded at least 527, making this the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history.\nCorrection (October 5th, 10am London time): The headline figure has been revised down from 59 to 58 to exclude the shooter.', 'date': 1506902400}, {'text': 'Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How the horror unfolded - in two minutes\n\nPolice are working to establish the motive behind a mass shooting which left 59 people dead and another 527 injured at a Las Vegas concert.\n\nGunman Stephen Paddock, 64, opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel towards an open-air music festival on Sunday evening.\n\nPolice found 23 guns in his hotel room, as well as firearms and explosives at his Nevada home.\n\nBut as yet, no clear reason for the killing has emerged.\n\nInvestigators have found no link to international terrorism, despite a claim from so-called Islamic State (IS).

At least 23 weapons, many of them rifles ranging in size from .308 to .223 caliber, were later found in the room, along with two tripods positioned near windows, according to police. And another 19 guns were found at his home, along with Tannerite explosive used in firearms practice.\n\nOct. 1\n\n10:08 p.m. Pacific time: Police dispatcher receives the first reports of shots fired at the Route 91 Harvest Festival. Country singer Jason Aldean is performing for 22,000 people, across the Las Vegas Strip from Mandalay Bay.\n\n“We’ve got shots fired,” a police officer shouts into his radio, as recorded by Broadcastify.com. “Sounded like an automatic firearm.”\n\nThirty seconds later, another officer confirms the shooting.\n\n“It’s coming from upstairs, Mandalay Bay,” the officer says. “I see the shots coming from Mandalay Bay, halfway up!”\n\n10:09 p.m. Casualties mount quickly, as reported by officers at the scene.\n\n“We have an active shooter!” one officer says. “We have an active shooter inside the fairgrounds!”\n\n10:10 p.m. Officers spend several minutes coordinating with dispatchers and trying to spot the source of the gunfire.\n\n“Just advising there are people down on stage left,” one officer says.\n\n10:12 p.m. There is initial confusion about whether the shots are coming from Mandalay Bay, the Luxor or even from within the fairgrounds. Despite the uncertainty, officers focus on Mandalay Bay and immediately move in that direction under withering gunfire.\n\n“Somewhere in Mandalay Bay,” one officer says. “It’s at the intersection, that’s where it sounds like. It’s that close.”\n\n“It sounded like an elevated position,” another officer says.\n\n“I’m going to form a strike team at Mandalay Bay and the boulevard,” one officer says. “I need five officers on me.”\n\n“We have multiple casualties!” one officer shouts. Gunshot wounds “in the medical tent! Multiple casualties!”\n\n10:13 p.m. Officers begin asking for help shutting down traffic on Las Vegas Boulevard between the fairgrounds and Mandalay Bay.\n\n“We’re seeing multiple flashes in the middle of Mandalay Bay, on the north side,” one officer says.\n\n10:14 p.m. Before seven minutes have elapsed from the first report of gunfire, an officer says he is on the 31st floor of Mandalay Bay.\n\n“I can hear the automatic fire coming from one floor ahead, one floor above us,” the office says quietly.\n\n“Just be advised,” another officer says. “It is automatic fire, fully automatic fire from an elevated position. Take cover.”\n\n“I’m right below it,” the first officer says.\n\nClark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said later that officers coordinated with security guards at the hotel to gather intelligence and learn that customers had complained about hearing shots from the 29th to the 32nd floors.\n\n“Some officers took it upon themselves to immediately go to the Mandalay Bay,” Lombardo said. “There was a team of six officers that approached security. They went up the elevators after discussing the situation with security and obtaining intelligence. They checked each floor, until they located were where they believed to be the room. Subsequently they approached the room, received gunfire, they backed off and SWAT responded.”\n\n10:16 p.m. At the same time, the carnage mounts on the ground below.\n\n“Multiple (gunshot wounds) in chest, legs, femoral arteries,” one officer says. “Send a medical (garbled) to Giles (Street) south, off Reno (Avenue).”\n\nReports flood in about injuries, including from Gate 4 where one female is shot in the legs and another is shot in the mouth. Officers again ask for medical treatment to begin at a Giles and Reno, diagonally across the fairgrounds from the Mandalay Bay.\n\n“We’re pinned down on the east side of Las Vegas Boulevard,” one officer says. “We’ve got about 40 to 50 people pinned against this wall. We’re taking gunfire. It’s going right over our heads.”\n\nAn officer is reported among the wounded.\n\n“We need to stop the shooter before we have more victims,” one officer says.\n\n10:17 p.m. The situation at a medical tent set up for the concert becomes dire.\n\n“We have multiple, multiple victims shot at the medical tent,” one office says. “We have one shot in head.”\n\n“Hey officers, stay calm,” another person says.\n\n10:18 p.m. “We’re in the medical tent on the east side,” an officer says. “We’re making tourniquets out of blankets, but I’m running out of blankets here.”\n\nClark County Fire Chief Greg Cassell said later that 108 firefighters from four departments responded to the scene, in addition to dozens of ambulances from three private companies, to treat injuries from gunshots, shrapnel and trampling.\n\n“I have never seen that many ambulances,” he said.\n\n10:19 p.m. Another group of four officers approaches the Mandalay Bay.\n\n“We’re going to make entry through the south wing, to make contact with the suspect, see if we can’t get up to him,” one officer says.\n\nAn officer already in position says a group is on that floor.\n\n“Copy,” the first officer says. “We’re going to make our way to give you support.”\n\n10:20 p.m. Officers evacuate wounded to the University Medical Center, one with a woman suffering a gunshot wound to the head and another with a wounded officer.\n\n10:21 p.m. Within 13 minutes, officers on the ground notice that the shooting appears to have stopped.\n\n“It’s been a while since we’ve heard any shots,” one officer says. “Does anyone have eyes on the shooter?”\n\n10:24 p.m. Up on the 32nd floor, police and security officers are closing in on room 135. An officer calls for a SWAT team after the gunman shot through his door and wounded a hotel security guard who accompanied the officers.\n\n“We have a security officer shot in the leg on 32 floor,” an officer says. “He shot down the hallway and hit a security guard.”\n\n10:29 p.m. As officers gather on the 32nd floor, there is still confusion about whether a second gunman could be on the 29th floor.\n\nDown on the ground, officers report that civilians are trying to get weapons from police cars to defend themselves.\n\n“Please advise all units to have their vehicles locked,” one officer says. “People are going in, trying to grab shotguns.”\n\n10:32 p.m. Police say multiple reports from the tower at McCarran International Airport about people walking across the runways. And first responders increasingly turn their attention to caring for the wounded.\n\n“Designate me one marked vehicle right now,” an officer says. “I’ve got an officer with a gunshot wound to the neck.”\n\n10:34 p.m. Amid the confusion, police keep alert to other suspicious activity. A black truck races out of a parking lot. A few minutes later, an older man wearing fatigues and carrying a black bag from the direction of the shooting climbed into a white recreational vehicle.\n\n10:46 p.m. With thousands of people leaving the concert, some got creative for transportation.\n\n“I had somebody take a patrol car,” one officer says. “I’m being overtaken by citizens trying to take patrol cars.”\n\n10:50 p.m. As officers converged on the Mandalay Bay’s 32nd floor, they took precautions to avoid shooting each other.\n\n“I’ll let you know before we come through a door, so we don’t have a blue on blue,” one officer said as he approached the floor.\n\nThe police confrontation with the gunman isn’t heard on the Broadcastify recording. But an officer on that floor of the hotel assures a colleague that they have enough firepower.\n\n“I have multiple rifles and plenty of officers,” the officer says.\n\n11:19 p.m. The airport warns of possible flight delays as police investigate the shooting. Nearly two dozen flights were diverted to other airports overnight.\n\n11:58 p.m. Police report the suspect is down.

Workers on Friday morning stacked the chairs in neat rows and picked up the garbage scattered across the artificial turf.\n\nThrough most of the week, the crime scene had been left untouched. Investigators strolled through it in small groups occasionally, but not continuously. They worked during daylight, and the area has been left dark at night.\n\nMost of the cars that filled an adjacent parking lot on Monday morning have been claimed, and only a few remained on Friday morning. Among them, though, were two large truck trailers, side by side. The one closest to the stage still serves as a billboard for Jason Aldean, the country star who was performing at the time of the shootings. It has his picture and name, the full size of a truck.\n\nThe N.R.A. calls for greater regulation of rapid-fire devices.\n\nThe National Rifle Association on Thursday endorsed tighter restrictions on bump stocks, devices that can turn a gun into a rapid-fire weapon, but did not say they should be outlawed.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, the N.R.A. said the federal authorities should “immediately review whether these devices comply with federal law.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“The N.R.A. believes that devices designed to allow semiautomatic rifles to function like fully automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations,” the group said.\n\nLast year, the N.R.A.’s online magazine, America’s First Freedom, called one of the rapid-fire devices “sublime,” and it advised users to keep copies of the firearms bureau’s ruling that such items are legal.\n\nVideo\n\nOn Capitol Hill, support appeared to grow for a ban on the bump-stock devices, either through regulation or legislation, as Republicans — who for decades have rejected any form of gun restrictions — began increasingly to speak out. Several leading Republicans, including Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, have raised questions about the devices.\n\nAnd in Las Vegas, a gun show scheduled for this weekend at the Eastside Cannery Casino Hotel has been canceled.\n\n“This was a mutual decision with the show’s organizers,” said David Strow, a spokesman for the Boyd Gaming Corporation, which owns the casino. “Given recent events, this seemed the prudent thing to do.”\n\nA murdered officer who was a joker and a father.\n\nHundreds of people took part in a candlelight memorial on Thursday night for Charleston Hartfield, the Las Vegas police officer who was one of the 58 people killed in the massacre on Sunday, remembering him as a big-hearted colleague, husband and father, always quick with a joke.\n\nAn Army veteran who spent 11 years on the police force, Officer Hartfield, 34, also worked as a youth counselor and football coach. In speeches at Police Memorial park in northwest Las Vegas, friends and fellow officers recalled calling him Charlie, Coach Chucky or even, occasionally, “Captain America.”\n\nPhoto\n\n“I know that none of us here really planned on saying goodbye to Charlie so soon, but I’m glad we get to send him off in our way, not somebody else’s way,” said Steve Grammas, the president of the Las Vegas Police Protective Association.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMany of the people who paid tribute to Officer Hartfield recalled his sharp sense of humor, how he was always ready with a comeback.

She said she feared it meant he was breaking up with her. Some media reports have put the amount of the transfer at $100,000.\n\nOfficials at the Philippines Anti-Money Laundering Council and the National Bureau of Investigation declined to comment on whether they were looking into the transaction.\n\nOther Philippine officials, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the subject, said that any overseas transfer of more than $10,000 was supposed to be flagged for review but that few were actually examined.\n\nThe volume of money transfers is so great, they said, that only questionable transactions or those involved in a crime are investigated. Even a transfer of $100,000 would not raise have raised any eyebrows, said a former United States law enforcement official who has worked in the Philippines.

McMahill said that door either had been left open or didn\'t shut completely.\n\n• Investigators looking into Sunday\'s massacre have found no known nexus to terrorism or connections to ISIS.\n\n• Authorities are confident there was not another shooter in Paddock\'s room but are still trying to determine whether anyone else knew of his plans.\n\n• Authorities do not believe another person used Paddock\'s room key at the Mandalay Bay hotel.\n\n• Investigators have reviewed "voluminous amounts of video" from different locations, including Mandalay Bay, and have not seen any other person they think at this point is another suspect.\n\n• Asked about video on which Paddock might have discussed motive, McMahill said: "I am not aware that we have recovered any such video."\n\n• Police don\'t know what the killer was going to do with 50 pounds of explosives found in his car.\n\n• Paddock brought the 23 guns and ammunition he had in his hotel suite over the course of several days, the undersheriff told CNN.\n\n• Paddock\'s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, continues to cooperate with investigators, her lawyer and McMahill each said Friday.

Today we are all Vegas strong," Pence told participants gathered at City Hall. "President Trump personally asked us to be here to stand with you, to pray with you, for strength, comfort and healing."\n\nThe President visited Las Vegas on Wednesday. Like Trump, Pence praised first responders, saying, "Their actions undoubtedly saved lives that night."\n\n"We find hope in the heroic actions in the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, the fire department and all the first responders on that night who, without regard for their personal safety, rushed into harm\'s way," Pence said.\n\nThe vice president called the shooting "a tragedy of unimaginable proportions" and said, "Las Vegas came face to face with pure evil" that night.\n\nRequest to seize shooter\'s assets\n\nThe family of one of the concertgoers killed last weekend is asking a Nevada court to appoint a special administrator to take control of the shooter\'s assets.\n\nJohn Phippen , 56, of Santa Clarita, California, was at the festival with his son Travis when the shooting started. When the son, a medic, stopped to help someone, Phippen stayed with him and was shielding a woman when he was shot dead, said a neighbor, Leah Nagiyvanyi.\n\nAttorneys for Phippen\'s family filed the petition Friday in District Court in Clark County. The petition asks a judge to appoint the county\'s public administrator to account for and control Paddock\'s estate -- in part to make it available for any future lawsuits filed by the shooting victims.\n\nPaddock, a gambler and retired accountant, owned a home in Mesquite, Nevada, and his brother has said he was a successful real estate investor who owned apartments and houses. Sales agents told CNN that Paddock paid $369,022 in cash for his Mesquite home in 2014.\n\nThe court "will notify (Paddock\'s) family members, and we\'ll see where this goes," said Richard A. Patterson, a California attorney representing Phippen\'s son Travis.\n\n"We want (Paddock\'s estate) administered by the court. I don\'t think we\'re at the bottom of (Paddock\'s assets)," Patterson said.\n\n"We want someone to oversee the assets so it stays the way it is," said Nevada-based probate attorney Richard Chatwin, who is working with Patterson on the petition.\n\nSource: Shooter tried to buy tracer rounds\n\nPaddock tried to buy tracer ammunition at a gun show in the Phoenix area in recent weeks, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CNN.\n\nPaddock bought other ammunition at the show, but he couldn\'t obtain the tracer ammunition -- bullets with a pyrotechnic charge that, when the round is fired, leaves an illuminated trace of its path -- because the vendor didn\'t have any to sell, the official said.\n\nPaddock did not use tracer bullets when he fired into the festival crowd hundreds of yards away.\n\nThe official explained that if Paddock had tracer ammunition, he could have had a more precise idea of where his shots were going in the darkness, and could have been more accurate.\n\nShooters wanting greater accuracy often mix tracer rounds with non-tracers -- perhaps having one tracer every fifth round in a magazine, said Art Roderick, a CNN law enforcement analyst.\n\n"It allows you to keep your weapon on not necessarily a specific target, but a specific area. ... There would have been a lot higher casualty rate if he had tracer rounds," said Roderick, a former assistant director of the US Marshals Service.\n\nJUST WATCHED New video shows concertgoers fleeing scene Replay More Videos ...

K.M. Cannon/Las Vegas Review-Journal @KMCannonPhoto\n\nDespite Mandalay Bay shooter Stephen Paddock’s history of high-stakes gambling, he had no known gambling debts, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said Tuesday.\n\nAnd, contrary to published reports, Paddock’s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, told investigators in Los Angeles she had no concerns about his mental health.\n\nIn an extensive interview Tuesday with the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Lombardo clarified those details and provided new information about the Oct. 1 shooting that killed 58 concertgoers and left nearly 500 injured.\n\nThe sheriff said investigators have made contact with Paddock’s entire “family tree,” including the shooter’s two ex-wives. Their conversations have shed new light on the shooter’s upbringing but have yet to answer the most daunting question: Why?\n\n“We may never know,” Lombardo said. “All those things that you would expect to find, we have not found.”\n\nHe said investigators are making progress each day.\n\nPaddock, a video poker player, checked in to Mandalay Bay on Sept. 25 — three days earlier than initially reported.\n\nLombardo said Paddock spent those first three days in a separate room, and the hotel provided that room free of charge for unknown reasons. Paddock spent the remaining days in the corner suite where he staged his attack, and he paid for the suite himself.\n\n“We’ve learned that there’s a difference of comp days versus personal pay days,” Lombardo said. “We were going off the personal pay days.”\n\nWhile investigators continue to comb through Paddock’s corner suite, nothing significant was collected from the first room, the sheriff said.\n\nThough Paddock checked in about a week before the shooting occurred, he did not remain in Las Vegas. Authorities believe he traveled to Mesquite several times in the days leading up to Oct. 1.\n\nThroughout his time in Las Vegas, Paddock did not interact with many people, the sheriff said, dispelling rumors the shooter had met with a prostitute for at least one night.\n\nBellman helped with bags\n\nOn at least two occasions, a bellman helped Paddock bring bags up to his 32nd-floor suite. After poring over surveillance footage, authorities have yet to spot any red flags about Paddock’s actions leading up to Oct. 1 that may have signaled his planned ambush.\n\nLombardo also said he was not aware of any video footage that may have shown Paddock driving into the desert near Mesquite to practice shooting his rifles, contrary to reports.\n\nDoctors have begun Paddock’s autopsy, and as of Tuesday, an examination of his brain revealed no abnormalities, the sheriff said. He did not have any information about Paddock’s toxicology results.\n\nThe Review-Journal first reported last week that Dr. Steven Winkler of Henderson had prescribed Paddock an anti-anxiety drug in June. Lombardo said the investigation has not identified any other physicians who have treated Paddock.\n\nThe night of the shooting, there were 51 Metropolitan Police Department officers working overtime to staff the Route 91 Harvest festival. When the volleys of gunfire began hitting the crowd, those officers formed several strike teams to find and take down the suspect.\n\nBut in the first hour after shots began, the echoes of gunfire created confusion, leading to false reports of gunshots at multiple Strip locations, Lombardo said. Medics were also dispatched to several different locations because some gunshot victims were able to run from the festival to different Strip properties, then call for help.\n\nBefore Paddock sprayed bullets into the crowd, Paddock opened fire down the hallway of the 32nd floor, injuring Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos. The guard, who was not armed, was on the floor responding to a door left ajar when he heard the sound of drilling coming from Paddock’s room.\n\nThe guard was shot in the thigh, and though Paddock fired more than 200 rounds down the hall and into nearby rooms, no one else in the hotel was injured.\n\nAfter the guard was shot, the guard radioed Mandalay Bay security, who then reported the shooting to police. The sheriff was cautious about giving an exact timeline, but he commended hotel staff for their response.\n\n‘Everybody did a fantastic job’\n\n“You’re never going to get me to say that somebody dropped the ball,” the sheriff said. “I don’t believe that happened.

Authorities have said they plan to return the belongings to people in the next week.\n\nMIKE PENCE PAYS RESPECTS\n\nAs Las Vegas police are appealing to the public for help in uncovering a wealthy retiree’s motive for massacring 58 people at an outdoor concert this week, US Vice President Mike Pence has visited Las Vegas offering solace. “We are united in our grief, in our support for those who have suffered and united in our resolve to end such evil in our time,” Pence said, joining Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman and other local leaders at a City Hall commemoration for victims of the shooting that followed a prayer walk through the city.\n\nParticipants trod 11km along four separate paths to City Hall for an event where security was high. President Donald Trump paid a visit to Las Vegas earlier in the week.\n\nThe commemoration came as Clark County Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said investigators remain largely in the dark about what drove retired real estate investor and high-stakes gambler.\n\nPOLICE SAY THEY HAVE NO MOTIVE FOR MASSACRE\n\nPolice in Las Vegas said yesterday they have looked at “everything” in Stephen Paddock’s life and can find no motive for what drove him to commit America’s deadliest mass shooting.\n\nSaying they could find “no known nexus” to suggest Paddock was acting on behalf of Islamic State, Las Vegas police confirmed he was alone in room 32135 of the Mandalay Bay casino when he opened fire last Sunday night.\n\nA lawyer for Paddock’s Australian partner, Marilou Danley said she “continues to co-operate fully with the investigation”.\n\n“She does not anticipate making any public statements today or in the immediate future,” he said.\n\nClark County Undersheriff Kevin McMahill yesterday expressed the frustration of police and FBI officers who have “run down well more than 1000 leads in this investigation”.\n\n“Some of it has helped create a better profile into the madness of this suspect but we do not still have a clear motive or reason why,” said Sheriff McMahill.\n\n“In the past, terror attacks or mass murder cases, motive was made very clear by a note that was left by a social media post, by a telephone call that was made.\n\n“Today, in our investigation, we don’t have any of that uncovered. I wish we did.”\n\nHe issued an appeal for anyone with any clues to come forward.\n\n“We do not clearly have a motive or a reason why,” he said.\n\n“I can assure we are aware of all aspects of this case to include the rumour, innuendo and suppositions by many in the public.\n\n“And I get it.

McMahill said Friday.\n\nAuthorities believe that the guard drew the attention of mass murderer Stephen Paddock away from the chaos below and toward the hallway outside his room.\n\nThe guard, Jesus Campos, was shot in the leg while checking on the alarm and according to a police-reported timeline, Paddock never fired on the crowd below again.\n\nThe alarm from a room "a number of doors down" from Paddock\'s likely was a coincidence, McMahill told CNN\'s "The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer." The door was not forced open, had been open for a while, and Paddock didn\'t have the keys to that room. McMahill said that door either had been left open or didn\'t shut completely.\n\nPaddock took his own life, authorities have said, after killing 58 people and causing injury to about 500 more.\n\nMcMahill spoke to CNN after telling reporters at a news conference that investigators looking into Sunday\'s massacre have found no known nexus to terror or connections to ISIS.\n\nThey have no credible information as to Paddock\'s motive, despite more than 1,000 leads and tips, McMahill said at the news conference.\n\nMcMahill said authorities are confident there was not another shooter in Stephen Paddock\'s room, but are still trying to determine whether anyone else knew of Paddock\'s plans.\n\nOther developments from the media briefing and McMahill\'s interview with CNN:\n\n-- Authorities do not believe another person used Stephen Paddock\'s room key at the Mandalay Bay hotel\n\n-- McMahill called Campos a "true hero."\n\n-- Investigators have reviewed "voluminous amounts of video" from many different locations including Mandalay Bay and have not seen any other person they think at this point is another suspect.\n\n-- Asked about video on which Paddock might have discussed motive, McMahill said: "I am not aware that we have recovered any such video."\n\n-- McMahill said police don\'t know what the killer was going to do with 50 pounds of explosives that were found in his car.\n\n-- Paddock brought the guns and ammunition he had in his hotel suite over the course of several days, the undersheriff told CNN.\n\n-- The FBI said it was going to put up billboards around Las Vegas seeking witnesses and people who might have interacted with the gunman.\n\n-- Paddock\'s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, continues to cooperate with investigators, her lawyer and McMahill each said Friday. Attorney Matthew Lombard said Danley wouldn\'t be making any more public statements in the near future.\n\nSource: Shooter tried to buy tracer rounds\n\nPaddock tried to buy tracer ammunition at a gun show in the Phoenix area in recent weeks, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation tells CNN.\n\nPaddock bought other ammunition at the show, but he couldn\'t obtain the tracer ammunition -- bullets with a pyrotechnic charge that, when the round is fired, leaves an illuminated trace of its path -- because the vendor didn\'t have any to sell, the official said.\n\nPaddock did not use tracer bullets when he fired into the crowd at the Route 91 Harvest Festival from his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel, hundreds of yards away.\n\nThe official explained that if Paddock had tracer ammunition, he could have had a more precise idea of where his shots were going in the darkness, and could have been more accurate.\n\nShooters wanting greater accuracy often mix tracer rounds with non-tracers -- perhaps having one tracer every fifth round in a magazine, said Art Roderick, a CNN law enforcement analyst.\n\n"It allows you to keep your weapon on not necessarily a specific target, but a specific area. ... There would have been a lot higher casualty rate if he had tracer rounds," said Roderick, a former assistant director of the US Marshals Service.\n\nBut tracer rounds also could have allowed police to see more quickly where Paddock was firing from, CNN law enforcement analyst James Gagliano said.\n\nWithout the tracer ammunition, Paddock\'s location was difficult to determine from the outside, said Gagliano, a retired FBI supervisory special agent.\n\n"The barrel of the rifle -- we could not see muzzle flashes, from the angles I\'ve seen on videos, which meant that he was ... pulled back inside," Gagliano said.\n\nA source close to the investigation told CNN on Friday that authorities think Paddock might have fired at massive jet fuel tanks at McCarran airport near the Mandalay Bay before firing on the crowd at the concert.\n\nAt least 88 of the injured still were in Las Vegas-area hospitals on Friday morning, 37 of whom were in critical condition, representatives of the facilities said.\n\nDid Paddock want to escape?\n\nFive days after the mass shooting, authorities still are trying to determine the motivation of the retired accountant, who had no criminal record and did not raise any flags while purchasing an arsenal of weapons.\n\nIn addition to the 23 weapons in his hotel suite, Paddock had more than 50 pounds of exploding targets and 1,600 rounds of ammunition in his car in the hotel parking lot, police said, fueling suspicion that he intended to survive the massacre.\n\nMcMahill said several times Friday that there was no evidence yet that Paddock intended to use the target material for a homemade bomb.\n\nJUST WATCHED What we know about the Las Vegas gunman Replay More Videos ...

The New York Times reported that authorities are trying to analyze its meaning, but Lombardo, the sheriff, didn\'t elaborate on whether they are significant or not.\n\n"Lombardo said that it contained numbers that were being analyzed for their relevance, and that it was not a manifesto or suicide note," the Times reported\n\nPaddock had rented rooms at other festivals\n\nBefore checking into the Mandalay Bay days before the massacre, Paddock rented a room at a Las Vegas condo complex that overlooked the September 22-24 Life is Beautiful music festival.\n\nIn addition, in August, a person named Stephen Paddock reserved a room at Chicago\'s Blackstone Hotel during the city\'s Lollapalooza music festival, said Wagstaff Worldwide, which represents the hotel.\n\nBut that person never checked into the hotel, which overlooked the festival, Wagstaff Worldwide spokeswoman Emmy Carragher said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the Stephen Paddock who booked the room was the same Stephen Paddock behind the Las Vegas massacre.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune, citing an anonymous law enforcement source, reported that it was the shooter Stephen Paddock who booked the room at the Blackstone Hotel.', 'title': "Las Vegas shooting: Alarm led to discovery of shooter's position", 'url': 'https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/06/us/las-vegas-shooting-investigation/index.html', 'keywords': ['shooting', 'cnn', 'hotel', 'tracer', 'position', 'paddocks', 'las', 'going', 'vegas', 'alarm', 'authorities', 'discovery', 'paddock', 'room', 'shooters', 'led'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': '-- The FBI said it was going to put up billboards around Las Vegas seeking witnesses and people who might have interacted with the gunman.\nJUST WATCHED What we know about the Las Vegas gunman Replay More Videos ...

Here is what we know:\n\nWhat is President Trump doing in Las Vegas?\n\nTrump and first lady Melania Trump arrived in Las Vegas at 9:37 a.m. Pacific time, where the sniper\'s broken windows at Mandalay Bay were visible from Air Force One at McCarran International Airport. Trump was greeted on the tarmac by Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo, Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman and Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt. Trump then visited the University Medical Center, where 104 people were taken after the Sunday shooting. Four of the patients died with injuries described as “non-survivable.” By Tuesday afternoon, 12 patients remained in critical condition and about 40 had been released, with the rest with conditions ranging from fair and serious condition.\n\nWhat is the latest on the girlfriend of the shooter?\n\nMarilou Danley, the girlfriend of Stephen Paddock, the man who massacred nearly 60 people attending a music festival in Las Vegas, has returned to the United States from the Philippiness. Danley, 62, was met at Los Angeles International Airport by FBI agents on Tuesday night after flying from Manila. Investigators named Danley as a “person of interest” in the investigation. Prior to her arrival, Las Vegas Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said “we anticipate some information from her shortly.”\n\nWhat is the background of Marilou Danley?\n\nDanley was born in the Philippines and moved to Queensland in eastern Australia in the early 1980s. She travels on an Australian passport, according to media reports. She is said to have left Australia for the U.S. in 1989, where she worked in casinos. In recent weeks, immigration documents in the Philippines show, Danley first arrived there on Sept. 15, departed on Sept. 22 then returned three days later on a flight from Hong Kong. Before Danley moved in with Paddock and became a "person of interest" in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history, she was an outgoing person and a "great neighbor," people who knew her said Tuesday. Danley would host parties and sleepovers for the neighborhood kids at the two-story home that she lived in with her then-husband in a newer community in northeast Sparks, Nev.\n\nWhat does Danley\'s family say about her?\n\nDanley\'s sisters said they believe Paddock sent her out of the country so she wouldn’t interfere with his plans, Australian media reported Wednesday. Her two sisters, who live in Australia, were interviewed by that country\'s Channel 7 TV network. Their faces were obscured and their names withheld. "She was away so that she will be not there to interfere with what he\'s planning," one of the women told Channel 7. "She didn\'t even know that she was going to the Philippines until Steve said \'Marilou I found you a cheap ticket to the Philippines.\'" She went on to describe her sister as "a good person and gentle soul," and said she "seemed madly in love with Steve."\n\nDid Paddock send money to Danley in the Philippines?\n\nPaddock transferred $100,000 to the Philippines in the days before the shooting. But it is unclear whether it was specifically sent to Danley. Investigators are trying to trace the money. Meanwhile, authorities also were probing reports that Paddock had recently gambled more than $10,000 per day.\n\nHow did the shooter obtain his arsenal?\n\nPolice have not detailed the type of weapons that Paddock, a 64-year-old resident of Mesquite, Nev., used in the attack. Gun owners in Nevada don\'t need a permit to buy or possess a rifle, shotgun or handgun, according to the National Rifle Association. Nevadans can even purchase machine guns or silencers, banned in other states, as long as they\'re within federal compliance. At least some of his arsenal was purchased legally at Guns & Guitars in Mesquite, Nev. Paddock also is believed to have purchased a number of weapons at Cabela’s in Verdi, Nev., a federal law enforcement official said.\n\nHow was the gunman able to fire so rapidly?\n\nThe pattern and inconsistent rate of gunfire signaled to experts that the weapons might have been semiautomatic, which require a separate trigger pull for each round, rather than an automatic that would continue to fire while the trigger was depressed. Sheriff Lombardo confirmed that some of the shooter\'s arsenal was legally modified with technology known as a "bump-stock\'\' that allows for rapid firing, similar to a machine gun.\n\nDid Islamic terrorists inspire the shooter?\n\nThe Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack within hours. But terrorism experts pointed out flaws in the claim, saying the gunman was older and more affluent than the typical recruit, without a history of crime. Two other claims in the last year were false. One was the June attack at a Manila resort that officials said wasn’t linked to terrorism, and the other was a bomb threat in September at a Paris airport, where no bombs were found. Since 2016, the Islamic State “has been claiming terrorist attacks with no evidence that had anything to do with them tactically,” said Erin Miller, program manager at the Global Terrorism Database.\n\nHow do other countries deal with gun restrictions?\n\nAustralian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says stricter gun laws enacted after a massacre of 35 people in Port Arthur in 1996 resulted in a dramatic decline in gun violence. The laws banned automatic and semi-automatic weapons, and featured the government buying weapons to take them out of circulation. During a three-month amnesty that ended last month, people turned over more than 26,000 unregistered, illegal or unwanted firearms without facing prosecution.\n\nHow many victims are there? Who are they?\n\nSheriff Lombardo said at least 58 people were killed and about 525 people had been injured. The first victim to be named was Sonny Melton, 29, a nurse from Tennessee. "He saved my life," his wife, Heather Melton, said. Other victims include: Chris Hazecomb, 44, of Camarillo, Calif,; Adrian Murfitt, 35, a fisherman from Alaska; Quinton Robbins, 20, a University of Nevada-Las Vegas student who worked in recreation for the city of Henderson; Heather Alvarado, 35, of Cedar City, Utah, who ran an in-home day care center; Carrie Barnette, 34, of Riverside, Calif., a restaurant worker; Rachael Parker, 33, of Manhattan Beach, Calif., a civilian police employee; Sandra Casey, also of Manhattan Beach, a special-needs teacher; Lisa Romero-Muniz, 48, of Gallup, N.M., a school counselor; and Susan Smith, 53, a school office manager in Vista, Calif.\n\nWas this an act of terrorism?\n\nAt a press conference, Aaron Rouse, chief of the FBI’s Las Vegas office, said the agency had found "no connection" between Paddock and terror organizations. Earlier, Sheriff Lombardo described Paddock as "a distraught person" intent on causing mass casualties. The Islamic State on Monday claimed responsibility, saying that the perpetrator was “a soldier” who had converted to Islam months ago. However, the group provided no evidence to support its assertion.\n\nWhere did the incident happen?\n\nAccording to police, the gunman fired from a room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay onto an open area across the Las Vegas Strip where the three-day Route 91 Harvest festival was taking place. Country superstar Jason Aldean, recently named 2017 Academy of Country Music Entertainer of the Year, was on stage playing to an estimated 22,000 people when the shooting began at 10:08 p.m. local time.\n\nHow many weapons were found?\n\nAt least 23 weapons were found in Paddock\'s hotel room, Clark County Assistant Sheriff Todd Fasulo said. The arsenal included semiautomatic rifles, scopes and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. Authorities also searched Paddock\'s home and found even more weapons — 19 firearms, explosives and unidentified electronic devices as well as thousands of rounds of ammunition.\n\nWhat else do we know about Stephen Paddock?\n\nPaddock was a retired accountant with a taste for high-stakes poker who had moved to his home in Mesquite, Nev., a city about 80 miles northeast of Las Vegas, in 2015. The gunman also had a long career owning and managing apartment complexes and also worked for the predecessor company of aerospace and defense giant Lockheed Martin from 1985 to 1988, the company said in a statement. Paddock lived in an upscale retirement community of about 1,400 homes called Sun City Mesquite by Del Webb. Residents must be at least 55, and no children are permitted to live there. His home in Mesquite is assessed at more than $353,000, according to property tax records.\n\nHow does this mass shooting compare with others in the U.S.?\n\nWith at least 59 dead, the incident is the worst mass shooting in modern American history. The prior mass shooting with the highest death toll was an attack at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., in June 2016 in which 49 people were killed and 58 injured.\n\nHow does the U.S. compare to other countries when it comes to gun violence?\n\nThe United States is in a class of its own when it comes to gun homicides. The U.S. saw on average 8,592 gun homicides each year — 2.7 gun homicides for every 100,000 people — between 2010 and 2015, according to data from the Small Arms Survey, a Geneva-based organization that tracks gun violence. That’s more than five times the rate of neighboring Canada, with 0.5 per 100,000, and more than 10 times that of the Netherlands and France, with 0.2 per 100,000 people.

Two cowboy hats lie between them, a reminder of what happened a few nights before. It was Sunday and the three-day Route 91 country-music festival was wrapping up. Jason Aldean, a famous crooner from Georgia, had just begun strumming the guitar chords for his number “When She Says Baby”, when bullets started to rain down from the sky. Along with about 22,000 other people, the couple looked for cover anywhere they could find it, eventually crawling under a stand. “We’re afraid to gamble; we’re the luckiest people alive,” the husband said as he reflected on what had happened.\n\nFifty-eight people were killed and 489 injured in the attack. Although police have yet to determine his motive, they have identified the perpetrator as Stephen Paddock, a reclusive 64-year-old Nevada resident with a penchant for betting. Mr Paddock smuggled a trove of guns to a luxury suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay with unobstructed views of the uncovered fairground where the Route 91 festival was held. He smashed through two of the gold-glazed windows and shot at the crowd continuously for about ten minutes. Before a SWAT team was able to break into his room, he had turned a gun on himself.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince December 2012, when a gunman killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook elementary school in Connecticut, there have been over 1,500 shootings where four or more people were shot dead or wounded in the same place at the same time, one definition of a mass shooting. Using a different definition of mass shootings, with a higher threshold, Jaclyn Schildkraut of the State University of New York and H. Jaymi Elsass of Texas State University counted 166 mass shootings in 14 countries between 2000 and 2014. Of these, 133 were in America.\n\nPolice recovered 23 firearms in the shooter’s suite at the Mandalay Bay. Twelve were semi-automatic rifles that had been modified with bump stocks, small pieces of equipment that allow semi-automatic guns to fire nearly as rapidly as automatic weapons—or roughly nine rounds a second. In addition to the arsenal found at the hotel, they found 19 guns at Mr Paddock’s home in Mesquite, a dusty retirement community 85 miles from the Las Vegas Strip, and seven at his residence in Reno. Nothing about the massive collection of weaponry—the types of guns found, the quantity or the modifications— was immediately deemed illegal. Short-barrelled shotguns, short-barrelled rifles and fully automatic weapons manufactured after 1986 are among the only categories that are prohibited outright. Bump stocks are legal and largely unregulated. Some Republican senators are now calling for the law covering them to be changed, setting up a trial of strength with the National Rifle Association.\n\nI won’t back down\n\nMass shootings account for far fewer casualties than incidents of everyday gun violence in America. An average of 93 people are killed by guns each day, mostly in suicides and homicides. But because of their scale and the way they inject terror into activities as mundane as sending children to school, attending church, dancing at a club or singing along at a concert, mass shootings tend to provoke more strident calls to overhaul gun policy.\n\nFollowing the Las Vegas attack, some of these appeals have come from people who previously opposed limits on gun ownership. The morning after the massacre, Caleb Keeter, a guitarist for the Josh Abbott Band, a country group that performed at the Route 91 festival, tweeted a diatribe that began: “I’ve been a proponent of the Second Amendment my entire life. Until the events of last night… A small group (or one man) laid waste to a city with dedicated, fearless police officers desperately trying to help, because of access to an insane amount of firepower…We need gun control right now.” Other gun enthusiasts are not convinced. Nephi Oliva, who owns a hookah lounge and gunfight-simulation centre a few miles from the Mandalay Bay, admits that even an armed crowd would not have been able to fight back against Mr Paddock. But he insists guns are necessary for self-defence in other situations. Pulling up his black, skull-emblazoned T-shirt to reveal a loaded handgun, he explains: “Say a guy starts smashing your head in. You can call the police and tell on him after the fact, but you still got your head smashed in. That’s not going to happen if you can defend yourself to begin with.”\n\nA growing body of evidence suggests certain restrictions can in fact reduce gun violence. Federal law mandates that only retail gun stores have to conduct criminal background checks when selling firearms. Transactions between two individuals are not regulated, allowing those without rap sheets to pass guns on easily to those with less savoury backgrounds. Certain states have introduced their own laws to close that loophole. Everytown For Gun Safety, an advocacy group, found that in the 19 states (and Washington, DC) that mandate background checks for every handgun sale, 47% fewer women are shot to death by their romantic partners, 53% fewer law enforcement officers are killed while working, and there are 47% fewer suicides by firearm. Laura Cutilletta of the Law Centre to Prevent Gun Violence, another advocacy group, also stresses the benefits of waiting-period laws, which require a certain number of days to elapse between when a gun is purchased and when a buyer can take it into his possession. Research published in the American Journal of Public Health suggested that, adjusted for population, states with such laws had 51% fewer firearm suicides than states without them.\n\nSuch policies, while still advisable, might not do much to forestall future mass shootings. Mr Paddock and Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, passed background checks allowing them to buy their weapons. Mr Mateen had to wait three days for one of the two guns he purchased. Mr Paddock carefully selected a room with a perfect view of the country festival; ostensibly to alert him to police approaching, he had set up cameras in his suite and in the hall outside. Waiting a few days to receive a weapon would not have deterred someone with such a coldly calculated plan.\n\nMr Paddock’s gun collection illustrates another intractable difficulty: the quantity of guns already in circulation. According to the Congressional Research Service, in 2009 there were approximately 310m guns available to civilians in America—twice as many guns per person as there were in 1968, and nearly enough for every man, woman and child to have their own.", 'title': 'The Las Vegas shooting has reinvigorated calls for gun control', 'url': 'https://www.economist.com/united-states/2017/10/05/the-las-vegas-shooting-has-reinvigorated-calls-for-gun-control', 'keywords': ['shooting', 'states', 'mr', 'fewer', 'mass', 'gun', 'las', 'vegas', 'killed', 'reinvigorated', 'mandalay', 'paddock', 'guns', 'control', 'calls', 'shootings'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Using a different definition of mass shootings, with a higher threshold, Jaclyn Schildkraut of the State University of New York and H.

Firearms enthusiasts called bump-fire stocks a novelty device that made guns hard to fire accurately, and said they had no real self-defense value.\n\nBut in the same statement, the NRA claimed gun control laws would not stop further attacks, and called on Congress to pass a law that would make it easier for owners to carry weapons across state lines – a measure that would gut local restrictions on gun carrying and might make it legal for tourists to carry their firearms on the New York City subway.\n\nPassing this “right-to-carry reciprocity” law, the NRA argued, “will allow law-abiding Americans to defend themselves and their families from acts of violence”. The NRA said banning guns “will do nothing to prevent future attacks – a fact that has been proven time and again in countries across the world”.\n\nResearchers who study the effects of major gun restrictions – including in Australia, which saw a decline in murders and no further large-casualty mass shootings after buying back hundreds of thousands of guns in the wake of the Port Arthur massacre in 1996 – would probably disagree.\n\nMoves in Congress\n\nIn Washington, Republican leaders said they would consider restrictions on bump stocks, raising the prospect of the first US gun control legislation for years.\n\n“Fully automatic weapons have been banned for a long time,” the House speaker, Paul Ryan, told MSNBC on Thursday. “Apparently, this [the bump stock] allows you to take a semi-automatic and turn it into a fully automatic. So clearly that’s something we need to look into.”\n\nThe mass shooting on Sunday night in Las Vegas that left 58 victims plus the gunman dead and wounded nearly 500 has reopened debate around the need for tougher gun laws.\n\nOfficials said 12 of the rifles authorities recovered from the hotel suite used by gunman Stephen Paddock were fitted with bump stocks. “I didn’t even know what they were until this week,” said Ryan, a frequent hunter. “I think we’re quickly coming up to speed with what this is.”\n\nHe offered no other details about what action the Republican-controlled House might take or what the timeline would be. But the remarks signalled a shift for a party that has thwarted legislative reform even as the horrors of Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook and Orlando have piled up.\n\nNevertheless, for many anti-gun activists, curtailing these devices would be the minimum Congress could do.\n\nIf that’s the only action we take after 58 Americans are shot and killed, we should be ashamed of ourselves Shannon Watts, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America\n\nShannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said: “Of course bump stocks should be prohibited, but if that’s the only action we take after 58 Americans are shot and killed and hundreds more injured, we should be ashamed of ourselves.\n\n“We’ll work with legislators interested in prohibiting bump stocks, but we’ll also demand other laws to help save American lives. Now is the time to demand that lawmakers prioritise people over gun manufacturers’ profits.”\n\nRyan’s comments followed a call on Wednesday by the Senate’s No 2 Republican, John Cornyn, for an examination of bump stocks. “I own a lot of guns and as a hunter and sportsman I think that’s our right as Americans, but I don’t understand the use of this bump stock, and that’s another reason to have a hearing,” he said.\n\nAnother Republican senator, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, said: “I have no problem in banning those.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A bump fire stock that attaches to an semi-automatic assault rifle at a gun shop in Utah. Photograph: George Frey/Reuters\n\nThe White House welcomed the NRA’s statement, but earlier the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said: “The president’s a strong supporter of the second amendment. That hasn’t changed. At this point in the process, I think we all need to take a step back. We’ve had one of the most horrific tragedies ever on US soil. I don’t think we’d want to go out and make rash decisions while we’re still having an investigation.”\n\nDemocrats are pushing for a ban on the devices, which are selling out as gun enthusiasts react to reports they may be outlawed.\n\nSenator Chris Murphy has outlined “a menu” of gun control measures he plans to introduce, including to expand background checks and to restrict people convicted of domestic violence from obtaining a gun.\n\nOn Thursday, the minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said on the Senate floor: “I say to President Trump: come out and say that you support and would sign a law to ban bump stocks, the modification used by the Las Vegas gunman to make his weapons automatic. That’s small, and it’s the right thing to do. Don’t wait for the NRA to make up their mind. Do it.”\n\nSenator Dianne Feinstein has also called for bump stocks to be banned. Congressman David Cicilline has also proposed a ban with a bill in the House that he said has 148 co-sponsors.\n\n'Gunsplaining' and conspiracy theories: how rightwing pundits saw the Las Vegas shooting Read more\n\nBump stocks were originally intended to help people with limited hand mobility fire a semi-automatic without the individual trigger pulls required. They harness the recoil of the gun to allow the user to fire much faster than if they repeatedly pulled the trigger – as the rifle recoils, the trigger bumps forward into the shooter’s finger to speed up the rate of fire.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic congressman Adam Schiff and senator Richard Blumenthal have reintroduced legislation to hold gun manufacturers, sellers and interest groups accountable when they are deemed to have acted with negligence.\n\nSchiff said: “This bill would pierce the gun industry’s liability shield by putting an end to the special protections the gun industry receives when they shirk their fundamental responsibility to act with reasonable care for the public safety.”\n\nPlay Video 0:29 Las Vegas shooting: Trump refuses to talk about gun control laws – video\n\nDonald Trump visited Las Vegas on Wednesday but when asked about gun control measures, said: “We’re not going to talk about that today.”\n\nLas Vegas plans to open a memorial “healing garden” on Friday with 58 trees to honour each of those killed in the massacre. It will also have a wall of remembrance, flowers, walkways and benches, “all to create something beautiful out of something horrific”, a city news release said.\n\nWorkers on Thursday were preparing soil at a roughly half-acre plot of vacant city-owned land at Charleston and Casino Center boulevards.\n\nAuthorities embraced the idea after a local landscaping company, Stonerose Landscapes, proposed and designed the garden as a space for mourning, prayer and reflection. The magicians Siegfried and Roy are among those who have donated a tree.\n\nThe garden is due to be open amid First Friday events, a monthly arts festival which is going ahead as planned, a sign that the city is slowly returning to its routine.\n\nA city council meeting on Wednesday had a moment’s silence for the victims before becoming a platform for competing views on gun control. “How stupid do we have to be to allow this to continue to happen?” said Bob Coffin, a Democrat, the LasVegas Review-Journal reported. He urged swift action to curb guns. “Hell, that’s not political, that’s survival.”\n\nA total of 160 firefighters from multiple fire departments across the city responded to the shooting, the Clark County fire chief, Greg Cassell, told reporters. “Our response time to that incident, I can honestly say, for our first arrive unit, was less than five seconds.”\n\nCassell described a chaotic scene as people jumped over fences, ran into taxi lanes and crowded into nearby hotels. The fire department received more than 32 reports of gunshot victims.

She said she had not been expecting the money and it had made her worried that he was breaking up with her.\n\nTrump and the first lady arrived in the Nevada gambling capital shortly after 9.30am, after Air Force One landed at an airport adjacent to the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino, the location from which a gunman rained down bullets on thousands of people at a country music festival on Sunday night.\n\nSpeaking at the city’s University Medical Center shortly after meeting injured victims, Trump refused to engage with a question about gun violence in America.\n\nHe praised hospital staff, police, and victims – some of whom, he said, were badly wounded only because they returned to the concert venue to help others. He said he had invited victims to the White House, telling them: “If you’re ever in Washington, come on over to the Oval Office.”\n\nHe added that his message to victims of the tragedy was: “We are there for you. And they’re there for us.”\n\nHe described the shooter, Stephen Paddock, as “a very sick man” and “a very demented person”, but said there was “not yet” information about his motives. “You will know very soon if we find something. We’re looking very, very, hard.”\n\nPaddock, 64, killed 58 people and injured nearly 500, using an arsenal of 23 weapons that included semi-automatic assault rifles that appeared to have been been legally modified so that they functioned more like fully automatic machine guns.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A semi-automatic hunting rifle with a high-capacity detachable magazine is displayed at a gun store in Rocklin, California.

Photograph: -/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe White House’s cautious choreographing of the Las Vegas visit comes after Trump has been repeatedly criticized for making inappropriate or inflammatory comments in the wake of several national tragedies since becoming president.\n\nWhile on route to Las Vegas, Trump appeared animated by other matters, tweeting: “NBC news is #FakeNews and more dishonest than even CNN. They are a disgrace to good reporting. No wonder their news ratings are way down!”\n\nThe message appeared to be a reference to an NBC report that the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, recently called the president “a moron” during a cabinet-level meeting – a report that has not been disputed by Tillerson.\n\nAsked about Tillerson’s reported remark during his visit to the hospital, Trump replied: “It was fake news. It was a totally phoney story. It was made up by NBC. They just made it up.”\n\nOn Tuesday, during a fraught trip to hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, Trump offended some locals by complaining that relief efforts had put the US budget “a little out of whack”.\n\nThe president used clumsy phraseology on Tuesday when, previewing his trip to Las Vegas, he said that what had occurred in the city was “in many ways, a miracle”.\n\nPlay Video 0:40 Donald Trump calls Las Vegas gunman 'demented' - video\n\nDuring his attack on Sunday, Paddock planted surveillance cameras outside his hotel room, apparently to look out for Swat teams approaching in the corridor outside during the attack, and used “bump stocks” to modify semi-automatic rifles so they could fire a rapid, continuous flow of bullets into a crowd of more than 20,000 at the Route 91 Harvest festival.\n\nThe result was carnage, with concertgoers fleeing in every direction, unaware of where the shooting was coming from.\n\nOfficials have said they know of no religious or political beliefs that could explain Paddock’s shooting spree.\n\nA wealthy, retired accountant and high-stakes gambler, with a pilot’s license and property investments across the US, Paddock lived with Danley in a quiet retirement community in the city of Mesquite, an hour’s drive from Las Vegas.\n\nLaw enforcement officials said they hoped their conversations with Danley, which were continuing on Wednesday when Trump arrived in the city, would yield important clues. They have declined to comment on the significance, if any, of a disclosure from the Philippines National Bureau of Investigation that she received a $100,000 wire transfer from Paddock last month.\n\nDanley’s sister, who lives in Queensland, Australia, described Marilou as a “good person” and said she would not have known anything about Paddock’s plot.\n\n\n\nDanley arrived in the Philippines on 15 September, according to documents obtained by the Associated Press news agency. She then left for three days and returned again on 22 September, a full week before the attack.\n\n“I know that she don’t know anything as well, like us. She was sent away. She was away so that she will be not there to interfere with what he’s planning,” the sister, whose name was not revealed, speculated to the Seven Network. She said Marilou was “madly in love” with Paddock.\n\nAn Australian man who is in a relationship with Danley’s sister came forward Wednesday to give one of the more detailed insights into the killer, outside comments from Paddock’s family, who said they were stunned by his actions.\n\nThe man, who declined to give his identity, told the Guardian he came to know Paddock intimately in recent years, staying with him in the Philippines and the US. He described him as a “extremely intelligent, methodical, conservative” individual who was nonetheless “guarded”.\n\nBut nothing at the time, including their “robust” discussions about US gun laws, rang alarm bells to suggest that he was capable of “such an inhumane, terrible, vicious act”.\n\n\n\nHave you changed your opinion on gun control? Read more\n\nHe said that Paddock had a “gun room” at the home he shared with Danley in a retirement community in Mesquite, and recounted conversations he had with the killer about the second amendment to the US constitution and the right to bear arms.\n\nThose debates have been reignited in Washington, following a familiar pattern after mass shootings in America, in which prominent Democrats call for restrictions on gun ownership and Republicans mostly adhere to the demands of the powerful National Rifle Association.\n\nThis week Democratic senators outlined “a menu” of gun control measures they plan to introduce, including efforts to expand background checks and restrict people convicted of domestic violence from obtaining a firearm.\n\nThe California senator Dianne Feinstein reintroduced a bill that would prohibit bump stocks, which can currently be purchased over the internet for $99. But Senate Republicans and the White House argue it is too soon for a debate on any new measures that would limit gun violence.\n\nBefore departing Las Vegas, Trump held a press conference, reading from prepared remarks at the city’s police department, where he was surrounded by politicians, law enforcement officials and attendees of the concert who had been praised for their courage.\n\nHe praised the “incredible character, courage, and resolve” of Nevadans. “In the depths of horror we will always find hope in the men and women who risk their lives for ours. The mass murder that took place in America on Sunday night fills America’s heart with grief. America is truly a nation in mourning.”\n\nHe added: “In the months ahead, we will all have to wrestle with the horror that unfolded this week, but we will struggle through it together.”\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report", 'title': "Donald Trump visits Las Vegas after attack: 'It’s a very, very sad day for me, personally'", 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/04/trump-visits-las-vegas-after-attack-its-a-very-very-sad-day-for-me-personally', 'keywords': ['day', 'know', 'trump', 'gun', 'las', 'victims', 'vegas', 'danley', 'president', 'donald', 'visits', 'attack', 'paddock', 'marilou', 'sad', 'personally'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Also on Wednesday, an attorney for the Las Vegas shooter’s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, said Danley had no knowledge of any plans by him to commit a massacre.\nSpeaking at the city’s University Medical Center shortly after meeting injured victims, Trump refused to engage with a question about gun violence in America.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Marilou Danley.\nWhile on route to Las Vegas, Trump appeared animated by other matters, tweeting: “NBC news is #FakeNews and more dishonest than even CNN.\nBefore departing Las Vegas, Trump held a press conference, reading from prepared remarks at the city’s police department, where he was surrounded by politicians, law enforcement officials and attendees of the concert who had been praised for their courage.', 'date': 1507075200}, {'text': 'Image copyright Getty Images\n\nA hotel worker has said he alerted staff to report a gunman had opened fire before the suspect shot dead 58 people at a Las Vegas music festival.\n\nStephen Schuck said he was responding to a jammed fire door on the 32nd floor when he heard gunfire and spotted a colleague who had been shot.\n\nHe called dispatchers and told them to call police as the gunman sprayed bullets down the hallway, he said.\n\nHis account has intensified questions about why the gunman was not stopped.\n\n"As soon as I started to go to a door to my left the rounds started coming down the hallway," Mr Schuck said on Wednesday.\n\n"I could feel them pass right behind my head."\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Police officers who entered the Las Vegas gunman\'s hotel room describe what they saw.\n\nMr Schuck said he encountered hotel security guard Jesus Campos, who had been shot in the leg by gunman Stephen Paddock.\n\nMr Campos told the maintenance man to take cover.\n\n"It was kind of relentless so I called over the radio what was going on," said Mr Schuck.\n\n"As soon as the shooting stopped we made our way down the hallway and took cover again and then the shooting started again."\n\nSoon afterwards, Paddock, 64, sprayed bullets upon a nearby crowd at the Route 91 country music festival, perched above in his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel.\n\nPaddock apparently took his own life after the attack, the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, leaving 58 dead and 500 wounded.\n\nAccording to CBS News, gunfire could be heard as Mr Schuck told a dispatcher on his radio: "Call the police, someone\'s firing a gun up here.

Heidi Fang Las Vegas Review-Journal @HeidiFang\n\nA sometimes combative and at times emotional Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo on Friday announced a second significant adjustment to the Metropolitan Police Department’s timeline of events surrounding the Oct. 1 Strip attack.\n\nMetro’s newest version reflects the latest information provided by MGM Resorts International, owners of Mandalay Bay, where the gunman was staying and from where he fired his guns.\n\n“I’m not in conflict with their statement,” Lombardo said during a news conference Friday, following a dispute that transpired this week over the timeline of events that occurred the night of the shooting.\n\nThe sheriff said Monday that Stephen Paddock shot Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos at 9:59 p.m., about six minutes before the gunman turned his weapons on the Route 91 Harvest festival crowd below his hotel suite. He previously reported Campos was shot after the attack on the concert crowd.\n\nTwice this week, MGM Resorts offered information that conflicted with Metro’s revised timeline. The company released the following details Thursday:\n\n“The 9:59 p.m. PDT time was derived from a Mandalay Bay report manually created after the fact without the benefit of information we now have. We are now confident that the time stated in this report is not accurate. We know that shots were being fired at the festival lot at the same time as, or within 40 seconds after, the time Jesus Campos first reported that shots were fired over the radio.”\n\nAt Friday’s briefing Lombardo said he agreed with MGM Resorts’ statement that Campos was hit about the same time shots were fired into the festival crowd. The guard was shot at about 10:05 p.m., he said. The 9:59 p.m. time stamp, Lombardo said, instead referred to the time when Campos encountered a barricaded door.\n\nLombardo confirmed to the Las Vegas Review-Journal after the news conference that a barricaded door he mentioned during the briefing was one that led from a stairwell to the 32nd floor hallway adjacent to Paddock’s room. He also confirmed that it was the same door that officers used a crowbar to break open when they arrived on the floor at 10:17 p.m.\n\nIn the hours following the shooting, preliminary information was released to the public to provide “calmness in the community,” Lombardo said, warning that details from Friday’s media briefing would likely shift as the investigation continues.\n\nThe sheriff also had said during the Monday news conference that Paddock checked in to Mandalay Bay in a different room on Sept. 25, three days earlier than previously reported.\n\nOfficials still have not said where the gunman’s first room was located in the hotel, but said that it was provided to him free of charge between Sept. 25 and Sept. 28, when he switched to the corner suite and added the name of his girlfriend, Marilou Danley, to the reservation.\n\nOther updates\n\nInvestigators are still looking for any details as to what led the shooter to open fire on the Route 91 Harvest festival crowd, including looking for any potential neurological issues.\n\nAn initial autopsy of the shooter’s brain revealed no visual abnormalities, Lombardo said. But police have sent the organ to “an appropriate evaluation facility” to look for microscopic anomalies.\n\nLombardo also updated the number of injured, which has fluctuated over the past 13 days. Lombardo said they now believe that 546 people were wounded in the shooting, and that 501 of them have been discharged from medical care.\n\nThe number of people killed remains unchanged at 58 as of Friday, though Lombardo said some of the 45 wounded who are still hospitalized are in critical condition.\n\nNo questions\n\nBefore refusing to take questions from reporters, the sheriff addressed growing criticism of the Metropolitan Police Department, citing the magnitude of the investigation.\n\n“In the public space, the word ‘incompetence’ has been brought forward,” he said. “And I am absolutely offended with that characterization.”\n\nBut toward the end of the news conference, the sheriff’s composure shifted from agitated to emotional as he commended several of his wounded Metro police officers, including officer Brady Cook.\n\nOn his second day of field training, Cook suffered four gunshot wounds from one bullet the night of the shooting. Cook and his field training officer, who were among the first to arrive at the scene, joined three other units stationed across the festival grounds. The lights from their patrol cars momentarily pulled the brunt of Paddock’s gunfire off the crowd of more than 22,000 concertgoers.\n\n“So the response of those individuals, I believe, saved lives,” he said. “And the reason I bring this one up, he asked me if he could go back to work today.”\n\nCook was discharged from the hospital less than a week ago. On Sunday at his mother’s home, he demonstrated to the Review-Journal that he still hadn’t regained full mobility in his right arm where he was shot.\n\nTaking a moment to gather himself, the teary-eyed sheriff ended the news conference with a show of gratitude to the community.\n\n“I want to thank you for letting me be your sheriff,” Lombardo said, fist raised in support. “Vegas Strong.”\n\nFollow @riolacanlale on Twitter.

on Las Vegas Boulevard EPA\n\nThroughout the investigation into the attack, those strange inconsistencies have allowed people to seize on the mysterious parts of the story and suggest something is being hidden about the attack.\n\nThat confusion is partly because authorities have now changed the timeline of what happened last night. And in that new timeline – given a week after the events – there appear to be a number of strange gaps and inconsistencies.\n\nThey suggest – apparently entirely without basis – that there is something not being told about Jesus Campos, the security guard who is said to have first engaged with the gunman. There is no suggestion, proof or substantial reports that there was anything unusual about his behaviour – but he has now found himself at the middle of questions about the police response to the attack.\n\nInternet detectives claim to have visited the man\'s house, for instance, and are poring through his online footprint in an attempt to make their theories stick. False reports have even attempted to blame him for the attack, reviving conspiracy theories about their being another shooter on the night of the attack, which have been entirely rejected by police.\n\nThere is absolutley nothing to suggest that Mr Campos was involved in the attack in any way beyond what the police have communicated: that he found the attacker, was shot by him, and then alerted the police.\n\nBut while the conspiracy theories appear to have no basis at all, a range of questions do remain about the events of that night – and it appears to be those questions that have led the attack to become such fertile ground for planting conspiracy theories.\n\nAccording to the new timeline, two hotel employees called for help and said that gunman Stephen Paddock had been shooting inside the hallway of the hotel, and that one of those shots had hit an unarmed security guard in the leg. That barrage of bullets inside the hotel came several minutes before Paddock went on to shoot out of the window, killing 58 people and injuring almost 500 in the massacre.\n\nPolice didn\'t arrive at Paddock\'s hotel room until two minutes after the shooting started, according to authorities. That has led to concern about how long police took to arrive at the room – they got there at 10.17pm, 12 minutes after the shooting began at 10.05pm.\n\nThat delay was despite the fact that police now say there was six minutes between Paddock shot inside the hotel and when he began his shots into the crowd at the concert. And there was a full 18 minutes between the shooting of the security guard and the police\'s arrival in the room – despite the fact that staff were reported to have told authorities what room and what floor the shooter was in.\n\nQuestions have now arisen about whether police actually knew about that. If they didn\'t, why weren\'t they told? And if they did, what happened in those crucial minutes?\n\nHere is an Associated Press run-down of what happened in those mysterious, crucial moments.\n\n———\n\nTHE CHRONOLOGY OF THE SHOOTING HAS CHANGED\n\nOn Monday, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said Paddock shot and wounded the security guard outside his door and opened fire through his door around 9:59 p.m. — six minutes before shooting into the crowd.\n\nThat was a different account from the one police gave last week: that Paddock shot the guard, Jesus Campos, after unleashing his barrage of fire on the crowd.\n\nThe sheriff had previously hailed Campos as a "hero" whose arrival in the hallway may have led Paddock to stop firing. On Monday, Lombardo said he didn\'t know what prompted Paddock to end the gunfire and take his own life.\n\n———\n\nBULLETS WHIZZING DOWN THE HALLWAY\n\nA hotel maintenance worker, Stephen Schuck, told NBC News on Wednesday that he told hotel dispatchers to call police and report that a gunman had opened fire in the hallway on the 32nd floor.\n\nHe had been called there to check out a report of a jammed fire door and made it about a third of the way down the hall when he heard gunshots. Schuck saw Campos, the security guard, peek out from an alcove and was told to take cover.\n\nHe described bullets whizzing past his head as he tried to flee the shooting.\n\n"It was kind of relentless so I called over the radio what was going on," he said. "As soon as the shooting stopped we made our way down the hallway and took cover again and then the shooting started again."\n\nGunshots can be heard in the background as Schuck reported the shooting on his radio, telling a dispatcher: "Call the police, someone\'s firing a gun up here. Someone\'s firing a rifle on the 32nd floor down the hallway."\n\n———\n\nSECURITY GUARD IS SHOT\n\nCampos had been dispatched to the 32nd floor before Schuck to respond to an alarm that signaled a door was open and heard an odd drilling sound, police have said. As he approached there was a series of single gunshots through the door, one of which hit him in the leg. At about the same time the maintenance worker arrived and Paddock fired more than 200 rounds through the door at Campos and Schuck.\n\nAs he was running away, Campos used his radio and possibly a hallway phone to call for help, Assistant Sheriff Tom Roberts confirmed to The Associated Press.\n\n———\n\nHOTEL QUESTIONS POLICE TIMELINE\n\nLate Tuesday, a spokeswoman for Mandalay Bay questioned the latest timeline of events provided by police.\n\n"We cannot be certain about the most recent timeline that has been communicated publically (sic), and we believe what is currently being expressed may not be accurate," said Debra DeShong, a spokeswoman for MGM Resorts International, which owns the Mandalay Bay hotel casino. The company\'s statement did not offer what it thinks was the correct timeline.\n\n———\n\nWHAT TYPICALLY HAPPENS WHEN THERE\'S A SHOOTING AT A CASINO\n\nA security officer in a casino-hotel the size of Mandalay Bay, with about 3,200 rooms, would typically report the shooting to an in-house dispatcher who would then call Las Vegas police, said Jim Tatonetti, an executive with Griffin Investigations, a Las Vegas company that provides security and surveillance information to casinos.\n\nTatonetti said they should have gotten word quickly about the shooting from the lead hotel security supervisor or they would hear the call from police dispatch.\n\n"When you have law enforcement on property you defer to them," Tatonetti said, adding that hotel security officers would turn to their primary duty: guest safety. Officers would focus on evacuating and keeping guests away from dangerous areas.\n\nA large casino in Las Vegas might have 50 or more security officers on a shift, Tatonetti said. Supervisors might be armed. Few on regular patrol have guns. Some might have emergency medical training.\n\n———\n\nWHAT WE STILL DON\'T KNOW\n\nIt was unclear if the hotel relayed the reports of the hallway shooting or the gunman\'s location to the police. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department hasn\'t responded to questions from The Associated Press about whether hotel security or anyone else in the hotel called 911 to report the gunfire. Police have not responded to questions about the hotel\'s statement or whether investigators stand behind the revised timeline released earlier in the week. A request for the 911 recordings was denied by police who said they were part of the ongoing investigation.\n\nAdditional reporting by Associated Press', 'title': "Las Vegas shooting: Conspiracy theories spread as police change timeline of massacre – and don't account for six important minutes", 'url': 'https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/las-vegas-shooting-jesus-campos-stephen-paddock-latest-rumours-conspiracy-theories-a7996621.html', 'keywords': ['shooting', 'minutes', '91', 'hotel', 'spread', 'massacre', 'music', 'country', 'las', 'vegas', 'theories', 'timeline', 'festival', 'important', 'harvest', 'dont', 'route'], 'tags': {'Las Vegas', 'iPhone', 'Podcast', 'Stephen Paddock', 'Kernels Podcast', 'Transfer news', 'Las Vegas attack', 'Brexit latest'}, 'summary': "Try another or register with your social accountQuestions are swirling about what exactly happened on the night of the Las Vegas shooting.\nMore than a week after the attack, police have still not laid out a complete timeline of what happened that night.\nPolice didn't arrive at Paddock's hotel room until two minutes after the shooting started, according to authorities.\nA large casino in Las Vegas might have 50 or more security officers on a shift, Tatonetti said.\nThe Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department hasn't responded to questions from The Associated Press about whether hotel security or anyone else in the hotel called 911 to report the gunfire.", 'date': 1507811013}, {'text': '(CNN) Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock opened fire on a crowd at a music festival just 40 seconds after shooting a Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino security guard -- not six minutes later, the resort\'s owner said Thursday, disputing a police timeline.\n\nThe new statement from MGM Resorts International contradicts recent comments by authorities who say Paddock shot Jesus Campos through his hotel room door at 9:59 p.m., injuring him, before the gunman opened fire on the crowd six minutes later.\n\nInitially, police said Campos had approached Paddock\'s room as the October 1 shooting was underway, diverting the gunman\'s attention. Paddock then shot Campos through the door and quit firing at concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest Festival from his hotel room on the 32nd floor, the timeline said.\n\nBut MGM, which also owns the concert venue, said the time the security guard was reported shot is wrong.\n\n"The 9:59 p.m. PDT time was derived from a Mandalay Bay report manually created after the fact without the benefit of information we now have. We are now confident that the time stated in this report is not accurate," MGM said.\n\n"We know that shots were being fired at the festival lot at the same time as, or within 40 seconds after, the time Jesus Campos first reported that shots were fired over the radio," MGM said.\n\nPolice were with armed Mandalay Bay security officers in the building when Campos first reported shots were fired over the radio, the statement said. The officers and the armed security personnel immediately responded to the 32nd floor, MGM said.\n\nLas Vegas Metro Police Department spokesperson Laura Meltzer said the department would not comment on the MGM statement.\n\nThe gunman\'s motive, the timeline of the shooting and why he stopped shooting are among the wealth of unanswered questions that persist after 11 days of investigation into the Las Vegas music festival massacre that left 58 people dead and injured nearly 500.\n\nThe lack of answers, especially about the timeline, seems all the more curious when, it would appear, many moments in the shooter\'s dayslong preparation -- and the actual assault -- were captured by hotel video surveillance or by cameras the gunman himself installed in his suite and hallway.\n\nClark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo has asked the public for patience, saying authorities are trying to "draw the most accurate picture" of how the shooting unfolded.\n\nFederal and local agencies continue collecting evidence, delving into the gunman\'s life and interviewing those close to him.\n\n"There\'s more than 20,000 moving parts associated with this investigation and it takes time," the sheriff told CNN affiliate KLAS on Wednesday.\n\nWhat happened in the 6 minutes after the hotel security guard was shot?\n\nAccording to the police timeline, an open door to a room near Paddock\'s suite had set off an alarm, prompting Campos to respond to the floor. Once there, Campos heard a drilling sound from Paddock\'s room, and he was shot in the right upper thigh.\n\nPaddock opened fire at 10:05 p.m. and unleashed bullets on concertgoers for about 10 minutes. The police didn\'t get to Paddock\'s 32nd-floor suite until 10:17 p.m. They didn\'t breach the room until 11:20 p.m., after a SWAT team arrived with explosive charges, Lombardo said.\n\nIt\'s unclear why Paddock stopped shooting into the festival crowd after 10 minutes.\n\nWhen SWAT officers breached Paddock\'s door, they discovered the gunman dead, apparently of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\nLombardo said Campos, upon being shot, notified security, and his action helped pinpoint the suspect\'s location.\n\nPolice didn\'t know Campos was shot until they met him on the 32nd floor, Lombardo said.\n\nIt\'s still unclear who Campos initially contacted and what happened in the six minutes between Campos being shot and Paddock opening fire on the festival. Also fuzzy: Why did it take 18 minutes for officers to reach the 32nd floor?\n\nMGM, in a statement Thursday, said it would respond to Gasper\'s allegations "through the appropriate legal channels."\n\n"As our company and city work through the healing process, our primary focus and concern is taking actions to support the victims and their families, our guests and employees and cooperating with law enforcement," it said.\n\nIs the new timeline of events correct?\n\nLombardo told KLAS the timeline is not static.\n\n"Nobody\'s trying to hide anything. What we want to do is draw the most accurate picture we can," Lombardo said. "That timeline might change again."\n\nResponding to MGM, a law enforcement source close to the investigation said police stand by the timeline, calling it "pretty accurate with all the facts known."\n\nHow could he meticulously plan this kind of attack without anyone noticing?\n\nOver several days, Paddock took guns and ammunition to his hotel suite. He had 23 weapons in his room. In his car were more than 50 pounds of explosives and 1,600 rounds of ammunition, police said. Twelve of the firearms had bump stocks -- legal accessories for rifles that enable them to be fired more rapidly.\n\nAuthorities also found a note containing calculations on distance and trajectory to the concertgoers below, according to a law enforcement source.\n\nLombardo said they have found "no evidence to show there was a second shooter."\n\nAuthorities have received 200 accounts of Paddock traveling around Las Vegas, and that he "has never been seen with anyone else," the sheriff said.\n\nThrough her attorney , Paddock\'s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, said it "never occurred to me in any way whatsoever that he was planning violence."\n\nWhat was he planning to do with the explosives in his car?\n\nInvestigators learned Paddock had "personal protection equipment with him," Lombardo told reporters Monday, leading authorities to believe he planned more than a mass shooting.\n\n"We know he attempted to shoot at fuel tanks," Lombardo said. "I would be comfortable saying, depending on the splash he made during the shooting, it would enable first responders to draw their attention to other locations, which would allow Paddock to just leave the hotel."\n\nWhy did he do it?\n\nAuthorities have received more than 1,000 tips but still have no credible information on Paddock\'s motive.\n\nLombardo admitted the slow speed of the investigation frustrated him.\n\n"It\'s because this individual purposely hid his actions leading up to this event and it is difficult for us to find the answers to those actions," he said.\n\nNothing about Paddock\'s life provides clues as to why he would have meticulously planned and perpetrated mass murder. The 64-year-old retired accountant had no apparent political or religious affiliations , one of his brothers said.\n\nPaddock would wager up to $1 million a night but wandered around casinos in sweatpants and flip-flops. He carried his own drink into the high rollers\' area because he didn\'t want to tip the waitresses much, according to a deposition obtained exclusively by CNN that was part of a 2013 civil lawsuit Paddock brought against the Cosmopolitan Hotel over a fall.\n\nHe had no criminal record. His purchase of an arsenal raised no red flags.\n\n"Currently, we do not believe there is one particular event in the suspect\'s life for us to key on," the sheriff said.\n\nIn the 2013 deposition, Paddock said he had no mental issues or addictions.\n\nOver the years, he owned apartments and houses in Nevada, Florida and California. Most recently, he lived in a retiree community in Mesquite, Nevada, northeast of Las Vegas.\n\nHe kept a low profile . Some neighbors rarely saw him.\n\nIn September, Paddock rented a room at a Las Vegas condo complex that overlooked the Life Is Beautiful music festival.', 'title': 'Hotel: Paddock opened fire on crowd within 40 seconds after guard was shot', 'url': 'https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/12/us/las-vegas-shooting-investigation-updates/index.html', 'keywords': ['shooting', 'mgm', 'guard', 'hotel', 'campos', 'paddocks', 'crowd', '40', 'opened', 'timeline', 'seconds', 'paddock', 'shot', 'room', 'festival', 'security'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': "The new statement from MGM Resorts International contradicts recent comments by authorities who say Paddock shot Jesus Campos through his hotel room door at 9:59 p.m., injuring him, before the gunman opened fire on the crowd six minutes later.\nInitially, police said Campos had approached Paddock's room as the October 1 shooting was underway, diverting the gunman's attention.\nPaddock then shot Campos through the door and quit firing at concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest Festival from his hotel room on the 32nd floor, the timeline said.\nBut MGM, which also owns the concert venue, said the time the security guard was reported shot is wrong.\nOnce there, Campos heard a drilling sound from Paddock's room, and he was shot in the right upper thigh.", 'date': 1507766400}, {'text': 'How police zeroed in on the Las Vegas gunman\n\nThe worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history begins during a music festival on a Sunday night in Las Vegas.\n\nDuring the final performance, a gunman with weapons stockpiled in his room at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino starts shooting into the crowd below.\n\nPolice working at the Route 91 Harvest Festival respond and converge on the shooter\'s position.\n\nIn the 10 minutes before the gunman shoots himself, he kills 58 people and wounds 489 on the grounds below.\n\nThis is how the incident unfolded (all times Pacific):\n\nSept. 28: The gunman checks in\n\nStephen Paddock, 64, of Mesquite, Nev., checks into room 135 on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, bringing “in excess of 10 suitcases” to the two-room suite.\n\nOct. 1: Paddock takes aim at concert-goers\n\nAn estimated 22,000 people are attending the Route 91 Harvest Festival, spread across a 15-acre concrete lot.

A man in her friend\'s group was shot in the stomach; they still weren\'t sure of his fate Monday afternoon.\n\n"It doesn\'t even seem real right now," Reitz said, crying into her boyfriend\'s shoulder.\n\nReitz was at home in panic, not knowing how many of her friends had been at the shooting, including her longtime coworkers, whom she considers family.\n\nThe couple tried to find out whatever they could on social media.\n\n"Later in the evening, I just kept seeing statuses (on Facebook), people posting that there was still an active shooter at Mandalay," Reitz said.

Gothard said her brother was even talking about going in with a friend to buy their own boat.\n\nThat all came to an end Sunday night when a man opened fire and Murfitt, 35, was shot in the neck while he stood near the stage.

A bump stock basically replaces a gun\'s shoulder rest with a "support step" that covers the trigger opening.\n\n\n\nBy holding the pistol grip with one hand and pushing forward on the barrel with the other, the shooter\'s finger comes in contact with the trigger.\n\n\n\nThe recoil causes the gun to buck back and forth, "bumping" the trigger and firing rounds much faster than if the shooter were to manually pull the trigger each time.\n\n\n\nThe stock effectively turns a semi-automatic weapon into a fully automatic one that can unleash continuous rounds until the magazines are empty with a single trigger pull.\n\nOn Sunday, the organisation said it was open to regulation but opposed any legislation banning the devices.\n\n"We don\'t believe that bans have ever worked on anything. What we have said has been very clear — that if something transfers a semiautomatic to function like a fully automatic, then it ought to be regulated differently," said Chris Cox, the NRA\'s chief lobbyist.\n\nPolice said the gunman of the Las Vegas shooting, Stephen Paddock, 64, fitted 12 of his weapons with bump stock devices that allow semi-automatic rifles to operate as if they were fully automatic machine guns, which are otherwise outlawed in the United States.\n\nMr Cox and Wayne LaPierre, the NRA\'s chief executive, accused the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives under Democratic former president Barack Obama of paving the way for the use of bump stocks and creating legal confusion about their usage.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, whose party controls both chambers of the US Congress, was an outspoken advocate of gun rights during his 2016 campaign for the White House.\n\nThe NRA spent more than $US30 million in support of his candidacy.\n\nSeveral Republican politicians suggested last week that they were receptive to legislation to curb the use of bump stocks, including Kevin McCarthy, the number two Republican in the House of Representatives, who said such controls were an area where Congress may be able to act.\n\nBut House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, a Republican who himself was nearly killed by a gunman earlier this year while at a baseball practice, was cautious about potential new legislation.\n\n"I do think it\'s a little bit early for people to say they know what to do to fix this problem," he said.\n\n"A week ago most people didn\'t know what a bump stock was so — to think that we\'re now all experts and know how to write some panacea law, it\'s fallacy," Mr Scalise added.\n\nSome gun control advocates praised the NRA for showing some flexibility.\n\n"This is the first time that the gun lobby has shown willingness to come to the table and I think that\'s in part because Americans just simply do not accept mass shooting after mass shooting happening and Congress doing absolutely nothing," Democratic senator Chris Murphy said.\n\nBut the comments from the NRA representatives suggested nothing may have changed as they admonished calls for gun control measures in the emotional aftermath of a mass shooting.\n\n"There used to be a common decency in this country where people paused talking about policy... they want to exploit a tragedy from day one. It\'s shameful, but apparently that\'s the new normal," Mr Cox said.\n\nInvestigators remain largely in the dark about what drove Paddock, a retired real estate investor and high-stakes gambler, to carry out the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history.\n\nReuters\n\nTopics: terrorism, murder-and-manslaughter, crime, law-crime-and-justice, united-states', 'title': 'Las Vegas shooting: NRA opposes ban on bump stock device', 'url': 'http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-10-09/las-vegas-nra-opposes-ban-on-bump-stock-gun-device/9030888', 'keywords': ['shooting', 'bump', 'mass', 'device', 'las', 'gun', 'vegas', 'trigger', 'stock', 'opposes', 'nra', 'ban', 'week', 'automatic'], 'tags': {'united-states', 'murder-and-manslaughter', 'crime', 'law-crime-and-justice', 'terrorism'}, 'summary': 'Las Vegas shooting: NRA opposes ban on bump stock devicePostedThe US National Rifle Association says it would oppose an outright ban on bump stock devices, like those used in the Las Vegas shooting which left 59 people dead, including the gunman.\nWhat is a bump stock?\nA bump stock basically replaces a gun\'s shoulder rest with a "support step" that covers the trigger opening.\nBut the comments from the NRA representatives suggested nothing may have changed as they admonished calls for gun control measures in the emotional aftermath of a mass shooting.\nInvestigators remain largely in the dark about what drove Paddock, a retired real estate investor and high-stakes gambler, to carry out the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history.', 'date': 1507507200}, {'text': 'A little-known device called a "bump stock" is attached to a semi-automatic rifle at the Gun Vault store and shooting range Wednesday, Oct. 4, 2017, in South Jordan, Utah.

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer) less\n\nA little-known device called a "bump stock" is attached to a semi-automatic rifle at the Gun Vault store and shooting range Wednesday, Oct. 4, 2017, in South Jordan, Utah. Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock ... more\n\nParticipants cast long shadows at a vigil for the Las Vegas shooting victims in Newtown, Conn., the site of the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012.\n\nApparently, it was all legal.\n\nThough an investigation continues, it appears that everything Stephen Paddock did last Sunday night, before breaking the windows in his 32nd-floor hotel room and pouring gunfire onto a crowd at a Las Vegas country music festival, complied with state and federal gun laws.\n\nNo law prohibited Paddock from buying the 23 firearms, including semiautomatic rifles, that were found in his room after the slaughter. And although federal law has forbidden the sale of machine guns since 1986, except for a limited number of high-priced weapons made and registered before then, neither U.S. nor Nevada law bans the modestly priced kits that Paddock apparently used to convert 12 of his weapons to automatic rifles that could fire hundreds of rounds per minute.\n\nThe worst civilian mass shooting in modern U.S. history has revived the long-running debate about gun control, public safety and the rights of gun owners. The carnage at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., in 2012 and a nightclub in Orlando in 2016 prompted much talk but no action, at least at the federal level; this time, some congressional Republicans have expressed support for banning “bump stocks,” the semiautomatic weapons conversion kits.\n\nThe events of last Sunday have also illuminated the gaping divide in gun regulations among states and the federal government.\n\nNevada fits the definition of a “purple” state — a Republican governor, a Democratic Legislature, U.S. senators from each party, and an electorate that voted narrowly for Hillary Clinton last year — but its gun laws are among the nation’s most lenient, reflecting regional attitudes and the influence of firearms groups.\n\nAnyone in the state who passes a federal background check can buy an unlimited number of handguns or long guns and, after meeting minimal permit requirements, can carry guns openly in public. Semiautomatic weapons are legal, as are federally registered machine guns and converter kits.\n\nNevada, like the federal government, requires background checks only for purchases from licensed gun dealers. The state’s voters narrowly approved an initiative last November to extend the checks to private sales and gun shows, but Nevada’s Republican attorney general, Adam Laxalt, declared the law unenforceable after a dispute over whether the FBI or a state agency would conduct the reviews.\n\nNeighboring California, by contrast, has perhaps the strictest gun regulations of any state.\n\nState law bans semiautomatic rifles and converter kits. Federally licensed machine guns are technically legal in California, but permits are generally available only to members of the military, police and film studios. State law prohibits the sale of gun magazines that hold more than 10 cartridges, and a new law, passed by voters, would bar their possession as well, but is currently blocked by a federal judge.\n\nCalifornia also requires background checks, and a 10-day waiting period, for all purchasers of firearms, and will require them for buyers of ammunition starting in 2019.\n\nTo some extent, states like California “can fill the gap,” said Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor who studies gun regulation. But with the stark differences among states, he said, “laws will be less effective than they otherwise might be. If you can buy one of these bump stocks in Nevada and transport them across the state border, a determined shooter will be able to get their hands on them.”\n\nAnother obstacle, Winkler said, is the shortage of research on gun violence — due largely to federal budget amendments, backed by gun groups since 1996, that have halted firearms studies by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nFederal data are available for deaths caused by firearms, however, and they show that after California began tightening its gun laws in 1993, following the murders of eight people at a San Francisco law office, gun-related deaths fell by 56.6 percent in the state over the next 20 years, more than twice the rate of decline in the rest of the nation.\n\nAnother study, released in June by researchers led by Stanford law Professor John Donohue, found that overall violent crime rose 13 to 15 percent more over a 10-year period in 33 states that allow their residents to carry concealed handguns, with few or no restrictions, compared with states like California that allow local law enforcement offices to deny requests for handgun permits.\n\nUsing data through 2014, Donohue found no evidence to support a 1997 study by two University of Chicago researchers that concluded “right-to-carry” laws reduced violent crime.\n\nResearch has been less conclusive on the impact of a federal ban on semiautomatic weapons, which was sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., after the 1993 San Francisco shootings and remained in effect until 2004, when Congress refused to renew it. Some studies found no impact on violent crime, while others reported a decline in mass shootings while the ban was in effect.\n\nIn general, the studies show that “California law is a good model,” said Hannah Shearer, an attorney with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a gun-control group based in San Francisco. In a nation horrified by the events in Las Vegas, she said, now is “exactly the time to have that conversation.”\n\nIt’s precisely the wrong time to make political decisions, countered Craig DeLuz, spokesman for the Firearms Policy Coalition in Sacramento.\n\n“Those who seek to ban the right to keep and bear arms are utilizing this tragedy in order to advance their own political agenda,” DeLuz said. He attributed California’s 20-year drop in violent crime to the enactment of laws like “three strikes” that increased prison sentences, and to an increase in statewide gun sales during that period despite the laws restricting certain weapons.\n\nWhile California continues to pass gun-control laws — bills on Gov. Jerry Brown’s desk would ban carrying rifles openly in non-hunting areas and eliminate school officials’ authority to let staff members carry guns — Congress is considering legislation that would allow gun owners to carry concealed handguns anywhere in the country if they have permits from their home states.\n\nRepublican sponsors put that measure on hold after the Las Vegas shootings but are likely to return to it after the furor dies down. But the usual partisan divide may not apply to one measure aimed squarely at gunman Paddock’s arsenal: the “bump stock” kits that convert semiautomatic weapons into the equivalent of machine guns.\n\nA bill introduced Wednesday by Feinstein would outlaw them.\n\nFeinstein included a similar ban in a 2013 measure that attempted to revive the federal prohibition on semiautomatics. The bill was rejected along party lines. Her new bill has two dozen co-sponsors, all Democrats, including California’s Kamala Harris. But a Republican congressman, Carlos Curbelo of Florida, is proposing a bump-stock ban in the House, and several Republican senators have also voiced support, including Senate majority whip, John Cornyn of Texas.\n\n“For the first time in decades, there is growing bipartisan consensus for firearm reform,” Curbelo said in announcing his legislation co-sponsored by Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass. The effort gained momentum Thursday when the National Rifle Association said it would support “additional regulations” of the devices.\n\nCongress may be emboldened to act against the converter kits, said UCLA’s Winkler, because “gun owners don’t like them. They make firearms highly inaccurate.”\n\nAlthough public opinion on firearms regulation fluctuates — support for restrictions tends to rise, usually only briefly, after mass shootings — polls generally indicate that gun control is more popular with the public than with a majority of Congress.\n\nGallup reports that 55 percent of those surveyed a year ago said gun laws should be more strict than they are, compared with 34 percent who said they should be less strict. Majorities approaching 90 percent favor background checks for all gun sales, the polling company reports, but a ban on semiautomatic rifles, once popular, had less than 40 percent support in the most recent survey.\n\nBob Egelko is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. Email: begelko@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @egelko\n\nCalifornia’s firearms laws\n\nHere is a closer look at California’s regulation of firearms — “common-sense gun laws,” as described by Hannah Shearer’s group and like-minded organizations, which say they could be a model for the nation; or, in the view of Craig DeLuz’s group, as attacks on the right to “keep and bear arms.”\n\nBackground checks: All purchasers must have their backgrounds checked for serious criminal convictions and other disqualifying factors, such as mental disorders, drug addiction and domestic violence restraining orders. California conducts a more searching examination than federal background checks and imposes a 10-day waiting period before gun delivery. A law approved by state voters last November, the first of its kind in the nation, will require background checks for buyers of firearm ammunition, starting in 2019.\n\nHandgun limits: The state limits private citizens to one handgun purchase per month, a law passed in 1999 after two high school students in Littleton, Colo., used multiple firearms to kill 12 fellow students and a teacher before taking their own lives. Similar laws exist in Maryland, New Jersey and the District of Columbia. Legislation to extend the one-per-month limit to rifles and shotguns was vetoed by Brown last year, and another attempt this year was rejected in the Assembly.\n\nAssault weapons: The nation’s first ban on “assault weapons” — semiautomatic firearms with detachable magazines — was narrowly passed in California in 1989 and signed by Republican Gov. George Deukmejian after a gunman used such a weapon to kill five schoolchildren in Stockton. Lawmakers expanded the ban to additional rifles in 2000 and enlarged it again last year to cover guns with “bullet buttons,” devices that allowed users to manually remove magazines and reload quickly.\n\nThe National Rifle Association, which campaigned successfully to block renewal of the federal law sponsored by Feinstein, has sued to overturn assault-weapons laws in California and other states, arguing that the guns are no more dangerous than other firearms and are legitimate weapons of self-defense. A federal appeals court upheld Maryland’s law in February, and gun owners backed by the NRA have appealed to the Supreme Court. Lower federal courts are reviewing California’s law.\n\nLarge-capacity magazines: In 2000, California banned manufacture and sale of gun magazines carrying 10 or more cartridges, a prohibition that was also part of Feinstein’s federal law against semiautomatic rifles and stayed in effect after the nationwide law expired. The new voter-approved law would take it a step further by banning possession of large-capacity magazines. It was scheduled to take effect in July but was blocked two days earlier by a federal judge in San Diego, who said lawmakers would be “disarming California’s law-abiding citizens.” The state has appealed.\n\nConcealed-carry permits: California, and seven other states, allow local law enforcement agencies to decide whether to issue a permit to carry a concealed handgun outside the home. Such permits are usually granted in rural areas of California to those without criminal records, but are generally denied in populous counties except for police and security guards.\n\nThe concealed-carry laws were fiercely challenged by gun organizations, who argued that the constitutional right to bear arms, which the Supreme Court invoked in 2008 to allow possession of handguns at home for self-defense, applies equally outside the home. But a federal appeals court upheld California’s law in June 2016, and the nation’s high court denied review a year later.\n\nFamily/police intervention: Family members or police can ask a judge to prohibit gun ownership by persons who are determined, after a court hearing, to be dangerous to themselves or others. The law was passed in 2014 after a mentally disturbed man fatally shot three UC Santa Barbara students and stabbed three others to death in the college town of Isla Vista before killing himself.\n\nGun violence research: In July, California introduced another first-in-the-nation project, the Firearm Violence Research Center at UC Davis, with a five-year grant of $5 million approved by the Legislature last year. The political sensitivity of such research had been clear since 1996, when Congress, at the NRA’s prodding, prohibited the Centers for Disease Control and Education from using any federal funds to “advocate or promote gun control,” a ban the agency has interpreted to apply to any studies of gun violence.', 'title': 'Las Vegas shooting highlights wide gaps in gun laws', 'url': 'https://www.sfchronicle.com/nation/article/Las-Vegas-shooting-highlights-wide-gaps-in-gun-12261195.php', 'keywords': ['shooting', 'weapons', 'state', 'laws', 'wide', 'semiautomatic', 'gun', 'las', 'vegas', 'law', 'federal', 'ban', 'firearms', 'california', 'highlights', 'gaps'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock ... moreParticipants cast long shadows at a vigil for the Las Vegas shooting victims in Newtown, Conn., the site of the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012.\nThough an investigation continues, it appears that everything Stephen Paddock did last Sunday night, before breaking the windows in his 32nd-floor hotel room and pouring gunfire onto a crowd at a Las Vegas country music festival, complied with state and federal gun laws.\nThe worst civilian mass shooting in modern U.S. history has revived the long-running debate about gun control, public safety and the rights of gun owners.\nSemiautomatic weapons are legal, as are federally registered machine guns and converter kits.\nGallup reports that 55 percent of those surveyed a year ago said gun laws should be more strict than they are, compared with 34 percent who said they should be less strict.', 'date': 1507467600}, {'text': 'Federal investigators have traced Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock’s rifles and handguns to at least eight gun shops in California and Nevada, the Bay Area News Group has learned.\n\nRelated Articles At Reno gun show, firearm fans denounce gun control but support bump stock ban\n\nWhere do Las Vegas massacre survivors stand on gun control?\n\nA ‘liberal teacher’ became a conservative enemy for a viral Vegas tweet.

The rest of the weapons were located at a house in Verdi, just west of Reno near the California border.\n\nPaddock bought 33 of the guns over the past year and at least 12 of the guns in the hotel had been outfitted with bump stocks, authorities have said.\n\nMany of the guns found in the hotel room were traced to a Sportsman’s Warehouse store in Reno, the source said.\n\nA manager at the large chain — which sells guns, hunting gear, knives, boats and other outdoor equipment — declined to talk to a reporter by phone Friday. The manager referred questions to the corporate office — which did not return calls or emails.\n\nA Bay Area News Group reporter was also turned down for an interview Saturday during a visit to the huge, cavernous store, where deer heads are mounted on every wall.\n\nReading this on your phone?

He also had his Colt M-4 assault weapon serviced at the store.\n\nEmployees at the store declined to comment to a reporter Saturday in the small, sparsely decorated store, with loud thuds booming from the next door shooting range. Emails to the managers were not immediately returned.\n\nLast October, Paddock pulled off Interstate 80 in Rocklin and bought two shotguns and a rifle at an enormous Bass Pro Shop store, according to the source. Despite living in Nevada since 2014, according to public records, Paddock used a valid California driver’s license from when he lived in Cerritos, in Southern California, the source said.\n\nTo buy guns in California, a valid California driver’s license or state ID is necessary.\n\nLast fall, Paddock bought a rifle at the Las Vegas Bass Pro Shop, but none of the guns purchased at either Bass Pro Shop were found in the hotel room, the source said.\n\nStore employees at both Bass Pro Shop locations referred a Bay Area News Group reporter to their corporate office, which did not return calls or emails requesting comment.\n\nWhen Discount Firearms, a large weapons store in Las Vegas, learned about the deadly shooting, it contacted authorities and told them that Paddock had bought a Daniel Defense rifle from them. That gun was found in the hotel room with a bump stock added to it, the source said.\n\nA store employee told the Bay Area News Group that the owner told employees not to speak to the media, and emails to the store requesting comment were not returned.\n\nThe source said Paddock also bought a shotgun and Smith & Wesson pistol back in 2000 at an undisclosed Southern California store.\n\nIn Paddock’s hometown of Mesquite, general manager Christopher Sullivan of Guns & Guitars said in a statement to The Associated Press that Paddock showed no signs of being unfit to buy guns when he purchased several from the store.\n\nAt New Frontier Armory in Las Vegas, owner David Famiglietti told Newsweek that Paddock bought a shotgun and rifle there last spring for $3,500. He said his employee and Paddock talked about how the customer wanted to use them for a tactical gun competition.\n\nLike our Facebook page for more conversation and news coverage from San Jose, the Bay Area and beyond.\n\n“My staff takes their job very seriously, and if there were any red flags during this transaction, like any other, it would be halted immediately,” Famiglietti told CNN.\n\nIn Utah, Chris Michel, the owner of Dixie GunWorx in St. George, told KTVX-TV he sold Paddock a shotgun and there were no alarms.\n\n“I didn’t think there was a problem with him,” Michel said. “He came in. He wanted a firearm. He knew exactly what he was looking for. He just wanted a shotgun.”\n\nStaff writer Casey Tolan, reporting from Reno, contributed to this story.', 'title': 'Where Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock bought his guns; it was all legal', 'url': 'https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/10/07/where-las-vegas-shooter-stephen-paddock-bought-his-guns-it-was-all-legal/', 'keywords': ['legal', 'bought', 'told', 'store', 'gun', 'shooter', 'las', 'vegas', 'source', 'stephen', 'paddock', 'california', 'guns'], 'tags': {'Las Vegas', 'Guns', 'Mass Shootings', 'Gun Control', 'Regional'}, 'summary': 'Related Articles At Reno gun show, firearm fans denounce gun control but support bump stock banWhere do Las Vegas massacre survivors stand on gun control?\nLas Vegas massacre weighs heavy on Oakland Blue Mass for first respondersHundreds gather to remember former San Jose resident killed in Las Vegas shooting Some were big box chains.\nPaddock bought 33 of the guns over the past year and at least 12 of the guns in the hotel had been outfitted with bump stocks, authorities have said.\nAlmost three miles north on Interstate 580 at Reno Guns & Range, Paddock bought a rifle and handgun in December, according to the source.\nAt New Frontier Armory in Las Vegas, owner David Famiglietti told Newsweek that Paddock bought a shotgun and rifle there last spring for $3,500.', 'date': 1507334400}, {'text': 'version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?

Sandy Lopez Las Vegas Review-Journal\n\nJesus Campos, the Mandalay Bay security guard who first encountered mass shooter Stephen Paddock, is shown in an image provided by the International Union, Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America. SPFPA\n\nBy all accounts, Jesus Campos has not disappeared. He’s landed on Ellen DeGeneres’ couch.\n\nThe 25-year-old had been dodging reporter interviews. Signs outside his east valley home still read, “NO TRESPASSING” and “NO MEDIA ON PROPERTY.”\n\nBut the Mandalay Bay security guard whom a gunman shot in the leg Oct. 1 before opening fire on a nearby country music festival crowd continues to stay in contact with his employer, and police don’t consider him missing.\n\n“Jesus Campos wants to tell his story at a time and place of his choosing,” MGM Resorts International, which owns and operates Mandalay Bay, said in an email to the Las Vegas Review-Journal early Tuesday. “He’s asked that everyone respect his request for privacy. We could not be more proud of Jesus.”\n\nApparently the place of his choosing is the “The Ellen Degeneres Show.” In an episode that will air at 3 p.m. Wednesday on KVVU-TV, Channel 5, Campos and Mandalay Bay maintenance worker Stephen Schuck will describe what happened to them Oct. 1.\n\nSchuck was caught in the initial hallway gunfire and helped direct police to gunman Stephen Paddock’s room. He previously appeared on “The Today Show” but otherwise has also kept a low profile since the shooting.\n\nIn clips of “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” supplied to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Campos reviewed the events of the shooting, recounting how he was alerted to check on a door that was ajar. He said he was on the stairwell going from the 31st to the 32nd floor and came upon a door that was blocked and wouldn’t open. So he rerouted through a hallway and called security dispatch to get an engineer to check on the blocked door. The worker summoned would be Schuck.\n\nCampos said he then heard drilling sounds and believed the slamming of the heavy door he passed through to get to the 32nd floor alerted Paddock to his presence. Paddock shot through the door and hit Campos in the leg.\n\n“I was walking down and heard rapid fire,” he said. “And at first I took cover. I felt a burning sensation. I went to go lift my pant leg up and I saw the blood. That’s when I called it in on my radio that shots have been fired.\n\n“And I was going to say that I was hit, but I got on … my cellphone just to clear radio traffic so they could coordinate the rest of the call.”\n\nSchuck said he came to the 32nd floor from a higher floor via a service elevator and rounded the corner. Campos was toward the end of the hallway, but Schuck said he didn’t know that at first.\n\n“I thought I saw someone hop out of the cubby, and I kept walking,” Schuck said. “Once I got more than halfway is when I saw Jesus and I started to hear shooting.”\n\nShuck said he thought the sound was a jackhammer at first but knew that was unlikely. He also thought the shooting sound was outside and not in the hallway yet.\n\nCampos leaned out and said, “Take cover, take cover,” Schuck said.\n\nTomorrow, the first people to encounter the Las Vegas shooter are here – security guard Jesus Campos and building engineer Stephen Schuck. pic.twitter.com/dDmjzN6xBx — Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) October 18, 2017\n\n“He yelled at me, and within milliseconds, if he didn’t say that, I would have got hit. I wasn’t fully in cover, and (shots) were passing behind my head and I could feel the pressure.”\n\nCampos said a female guest came out of another room’s door and he told her to go back in because it wasn’t safe. Campos told Schuck to stay back and take cover. More rounds from the shooter’s guns followed, Campos said.\n\nCampos seemed to acknowledge that he wouldn’t revisit the events of Oct. 1 after his interview with DeGeneres.\n\nDeGeneres said, “You’re talking about it now and then you’re not going to talk about it again, and I don’t blame you because why relive this over and over?” Campos nodded.\n\nCampos then thanked Metro, the FBI, the first responders, people who got called into the hospitals, and the community for coming together valiantly.\n\n“Everything puts pieces together on how everyone came together to help that night even in the darkest hour,” Campos said.\n\nThe question of Campos’ location first arose Thursday, when Campos failed to show up to five television interviews scheduled by the International Union, Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America.\n\nHis neighbors haven’t seen him in a few days. No “Jesus Campos” is registered as a guest at any MGM properties on the Strip.\n\nAnd while calls to his listed telephone numbers continue to go unanswered, Metropolitan Police Department spokesman Larry Hadfield said Campos is “fully cooperating with the investigation.”\n\nFluid timeline\n\nCampos became a critical witness the second he was shot in the right thigh.\n\nInterest in speaking with Campos intensified after Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo began changing the timeline of the shooting, which left at least 58 dead and more than 500 injured.\n\nLombardo first said Campos had been shot after the gunman opened fire on the festival crowd. He hailed the guard as a hero and even cited Campos as a reason why Paddock may have stopped firing on the crowd, fearing authorities were closing in.\n\nPaddock shot himself in the room sometime after that, the sheriff said.\n\nDuring that initial explanation of events, Lombardo said it was a “miracle” Campos survived. Investigators recovered about 200 rounds in the 32nd-floor hallway where the security guard had ducked and covered while nursing his wound.\n\nWhen the gunfire stopped, the sheriff said, Campos even helped hotel guests to safety until officers arrived to breach the gunman’s room.\n\nThen, without much context, Lombardo said early last week that Campos had actually been shot at 9:59 p.m., six minutes before the gunman ever opened fire on the festival. He added that Campos never actually helped hotel guests out but he still considered Campos a hero.\n\nWithin a day, MGM disputed the sheriff’s new timeline.

Add Interest\n\nCampos and Mandalay Bay building engineer Stephen Schuck were DeGeneres\' guests in an interview taped Tuesday.\n\n"As I was walking down [the hallway], I heard rapid fire," Campos told DeGeneres in the interview. "I took cover, and I felt a burning sensation. I went to go lift my pant leg up and saw blood. That\'s when I called in on my radio that shots were fired."\n\nThe show released an eight-minute clip of the interview on Tuesday night, and the full episode will air Wednesday afternoon.\n\nCampos laid out his recollection of the events leading up to Paddock\'s firing on a crowd at a country music festival across the street from the Mandalay Bay hotel on Oct. 1. Fifty-eight people were killed, and hundreds more were injured, in the deadliest shooting in modern U.S. history.\n\nCampos\' account on "Ellen" was in line with much of what has been reported on the shooting. He did not specify times for his account — a point of confusion in the investigation.\n\nHe said he was on the 31st floor of the hotel when he was called to check on an open door on the 32nd floor. When he went to a stairwell, he found the door to the 32nd floor was jammed. He left the stairwell and took an elevator to the 32nd floor to check why the door wasn\'t opening.\n\nCampos said the door was jammed using brackets, so he called engineering, which sent Schuck to look.\n\nAs Campos was walking back down the hallway, with his back to the suite Paddock was in, the gunman opened fire. Campos said he realized he had been hit and was bleeding.\n\nSchuck reached the 32nd floor and approached the same hallway, completely unaware of the situation unfolding.\n\n"Once I got more than halfway [down the hallway] is when I saw Jesus and heard shooting," Schuck said. "At first I thought it was a jackhammer.\n\n"Jesus leaned out and said, \'Take cover, take cover,\' and yelled at me, and within milliseconds, if he didn\'t say that, I could\'ve got hit."\n\nSchuck described the "pressure" of the bullets flying past his head as he ducked behind a door frame for cover.\n\nMark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images\n\nCampos and Schuck did not elaborate further on the situation or clarify why it took so long — about 20 minutes, according to Las Vegas police accounts — for police to reach the 32nd floor. When police eventually breached the door to Paddock\'s suite, he was found dead of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot.\n\nSchuck and Campos thanked the Las Vegas Metro Police Department and other first responders for their efforts in the aftermath of the shooting.\n\nCampos appeared on "Ellen" for what he said would be his only public comments on the shooting. He was noticeably emotional in the interview, often being patted on the back by Schuck and comforted by DeGeneres.\n\nSchuck previously spoke to NBC, and Campos drew attention recently after he skipped out on scheduled interviews with Fox News and other outlets last Thursday. The Associated Press reported that Campos had "disappeared" after requesting to go to a walk-in medical clinic on Thursday. Other interviews were canceled, and the head of his union had been unable to contact with him.\n\n"Thank you so much for being here," DeGeneres said at the close of the interview. "I know you\'ve had so many people asking for you to tell the story and talk about this, and I understand your reluctance because you just want this to be over."\n\n"You\'re talking about it now, and then you\'re not going to talk about it again," DeGeneres continued. "And I don\'t blame you, because to relive this over and over again ...

So I think now is the time for political debate," Kimmel said.\n\nAuthorities clarified Tuesday night that the widely reported number of 59 deaths includes the gunman.\n\nHours after the massacre, President Donald Trump tweeted his “warmest condolences and sympathies to the victims and families of the terrible Las Vegas shooting.”\n\nThe president also dubbed the attack an “act of pure evil,” but on Tuesday said there will be a conversation about gun laws “as time goes by.”\n\nSen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., called the attack “senseless” and offered his prayers as well. Vice President Mike Pence offered condolences.\n\nKimmel also criticized politicians like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.\n\n“They should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country,” Kimmel said.\n\nThe comedian said he hates talking about politics on his show, but finds gun control to be a “public safety issue” worth discussing.\n\n“I want this to be a comedy show,” he added. “I just want to laugh about things every night, but it seems to be increasingly difficult lately.

On a dismal Monday, during which the N.R.A. captives who are running the country had nothing more to offer than bromides and prayers, it was left to Jimmy Kimmel, at a television recording studio on Hollywood Boulevard, to register a cry for humanity, and a protest at the failing U.S. political system.\n\n“Well, hello, everyone, in the aftermath of another terrible and inexplicable, shocking and painful tragedy, this time in Las Vegas, which happens to be my home town,” Kimmel said in a shaky voice at the start of his opening monologue. After citing the number of dead and injured, he went on, “We wonder why, although there’s probably no way to ever know why a human being would ever do something like this to other human beings who are at a concert having fun, listening to music . . . It’s the kind of thing that makes you want to throw up, or give up. It’s too much to even process.”\n\nKimmel is paid handsomely to send people to bed with smiles on their faces. On Monday, many of his viewers were probably tuning in to escape the round-the-clock news coverage of the Las Vegas shooting. But, rather than looking for laughs, Kimmel chose to state some harsh truths and name names.\n\n“I’ve been reading comments from people saying this is terrible, but there is nothing we can do about it,” he said. “But I disagree with that intensely, because of course there’s something we can do about it. There are a lot of things we can do about it. But we don’t. Which is interesting, because when someone with a beard attacks us, we tap phones, we invoke travel bans, we build walls—we take every possible precaution to make sure it doesn’t happen again. But when an American buys a gun and kills other Americans, then there’s nothing we can do about that. Second Amendment, I guess. Our forefathers wanted us to have AK-47s is the argument, I assume.”\n\nIf that was meant to be a joke, Kimmel wasn’t laughing. Noting that President Trump had offered prayers for the victims’ families, and that Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, had said that this wasn’t the time for political debate, he went on, “We have fifty-nine innocent people dead. It wasn’t their time, either. So I think now is the time for political debate.” He reminded his audience that, in February, Trump had signed a bill that made it easier for people with mental illness to buy guns. “The Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, a number of other lawmakers who won’t do anything about this because the N.R.A. has their balls in a money clip, also sent their thoughts and their prayers today. Which is good. They should be praying. They should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country.”\n\nRepublicans and gun-rights advocates will tell Kimmel to stick to celebrity interviews, but lately he has decided to politicize his show. In April, he revealed that his young son, Billy, had been diagnosed with a heart ailment requiring expensive surgery and follow-up treatment. Speaking about the situation on air, Kimmel pointed out that, before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, Billy would have been tagged with a preëxisting-condition label, and would have had a harder time getting insurance coverage for the rest of his life. Kimmel’s remarks prompted Bill Cassidy, the Republican senator from Louisiana, to say that any health-care legislation needed to pass the “Jimmy Kimmel test.” Last month, when the Senate was considering a regressive health-care-reform bill championed by Cassidy, Kimmel told his audience that the senator had “just lied right to my face” when he appeared on the show.\n\nOn Monday, Kimmel put up on the screen the faces of the fifty-six senators who, days after last year’s mass shooting in Orlando, voted down a bill that would have expanded background checks for gun purchases. He also pointed to a bill working its way through the House of Representatives that would legalize the sale of gun silencers. “We have a major problem with gun violence in this country, and I guess they don’t care,” Kimmel said, his voice starting to break up again. “If I’m wrong on that, fine. Do something about it. Because I’m sick of it . . . I want this to be a comedy show. I hate talking about stuff like this. I just want to just laugh about things every night. But it seems to be becoming increasingly difficult lately. It seems like somebody has opened a window into Hell.”\n\nIndeed, it does. And, as Kimmel noted, what’s more frustrating is that the country’s current situation is so needless and contrary to ordinary intuition. “This isn’t about gun control, it is about common sense,” Kimmel went on. “Common sense says no good will ever comes from allowing a person to have weapons that can take down five hundred and twenty-seven Americans at a concert. Common sense says you don’t let those who suffer from mental illness buy guns.”\n\nLast year, he noted, the N.R.A. even tried to get a bill passed that would have allowed people on the federal no-fly list to buy guns. “Who thinks that makes sense? Them, I guess,” Kimmel said, pointing to the faces of the senators. “Maybe I’m nuts, but I would like to think that we can put politics aside and agree that no American citizen needs an M-16, or maybe ten of them. And maybe that way we don’t do this again. I mean, that seems very reasonable to me.”\n\nFinally, the studio audience, which seemed to have been stunned into silence by an address that was emotional but also admirably disciplined, started to clap.

But the tragic fact is that there will be no end to the gun massacres in America. Nights like last night will be replayed many times in the years ahead.\n\nThere is no end to gun availability in America — estimates are there is at least one gun for every citizen of the United States, so more than 300 million within easy reach.\n\nAnyone determined to obtain guns can and will, despite any existing waiting periods, background checks, mental health warning flags or other proposed palliatives.\n\nGun lobby holds sway\n\nThe gun lobby has a stranglehold on the political process in Washington.\n\nNo sensible gun control could be enacted after the massacre of 20 children and six teachers in Sandy Hook Connecticut. No modest gun control could be considered in Congress after a young man murdered black worshippers in Charleston South Carolina.\n\nNothing changed after these events, which brought a president to tears (it was the hardest, the toughest day of his presidency, Obama said).\n\nNothing changed after the near fatal shootings of congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords in 2011 as she greeted constituents, or congressman Steve Scalise at a charity baseball practice this year.\n\nIf the elected representatives of the American people cannot in the aftermath of those horrific events translate the yearning of people across the country to do something real and meaningful about guns, then nothing will be done.\n\nAmericans want gun control\n\nPolls have found that a clear majority of Americans favour more gun control.\n\nIn the Clinton presidency, a ban on assault weapons was enacted. It expired after 10 years, and the National Rifle Association has blocked every attempt to reinstate it.\n\nAnd it certainly will not be revived by this President. He is not in the pocket of the National Rifle Association; he is a co-conspirator with the NRA.\n\nIn April, Trump addressed their national convention:\n\n"Only one candidate in the general election came to speak to you and that candidate is now the President of the United States standing before you again … The eight-year assault on your Second Amendment freedoms has come to a crashing end. You have a true friend and champion in the White House."\n\nAddressing the nation after the Las Vegas shooting, Trump called for "unity and peace" in the face of the violence.\n\nOn Twitter he offered his "warmest condolences and sympathies" to the victims and their families.\n\nWords that change nothing.\n\nNo more surprises\n\nAs sad and tragic as the Las Vegas massacre is, the only certainty in the life of America\'s gun culture is that it will continue unabated.\n\nWe cannot be surprised any more.\n\nThere will be many more nights of gun death and horror across America.\n\nThe gun lobby is stronger than any president, it is stronger than any voices in Congress, and will continue to reap its murderous whirlwind.\n\nThere is no end to the carnage, or the power of those responsible for the culture that allows it to occur.\n\nBruce Wolpe worked with the Democrats in Congress in Barack Obama\'s first term.

Here are five big obstacles that stand in the way.\n\nThe NRA\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A woman shows off a model gun and holster at an NRA fashion show\n\nThe National Rifle Association is one of the most influential interest groups in US politics - not just because of the money it spends on lobbying politicians, but also because of the engagement of its 5 million members.\n\nIt opposes most proposals to strengthen firearm regulations and is behind efforts at both the federal and state levels to roll back many existing restrictions on gun ownership.\n\nIn 2016 the NRA spent $4m on lobbying and direct contributions to politicians as well as more than $50m on political advocacy, including an estimated $30m to help elect Donald Trump president.\n\nIts overall annual budget is roughly $250m, allocated to educational programmes, gun facilities, membership events, sponsorships, legal advocacy and related efforts.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Nevada State Senator Don Gustavson: "I\'ve shot those guns myself before - they\'re fun to shoot at targets"\n\nMore than just the numbers, however, the NRA has developed a reputation in Washington as a political force that can make or break even the strongest politicians.\n\nIt grades politicians on their votes and directs its resources and those of its membership - both financial and organisational - to supporting its fiercest advocates and defeating staunch opponents.\n\nAs one former Republican congressman told the New York Times in 2013: "That was the one group where I said, \'As long as I\'m in office, I\'m not bucking the NRA.\'"\n\nCould it change? Gun-control groups, backed by wealthy benefactors like former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, have become more organised in recent years, attempting to match the NRA\'s political might. As long as pro-gun groups keep racking up the legislative and electoral wins, however, they\'ll still be king of the hill.\n\nGerrymandering\n\nMost recent attempts to pass new federal laws regulating firearms are over before they ever really begin, stymied in the US House of Representatives, which has been in Republican hands since 2011.\n\nIn June 2016 a group of Democratic politicians staged a sit-in on the floor of the House to protest the Republican House leadership\'s decision not to hold a vote on two gun-control bills.\n\nThe House tends to have a pro-gun-rights tilt for the same reason it has recently tended toward the Republican Party in numbers larger than the pure national congressional vote total would indicate.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption House members sit on the floor "to demand action on common sense gun legislation"\n\nDue to the way the lines of House congressional districts are drawn, many by Republican-controlled state legislatures, there are more "safe" seats for Republicans than there are for Democrats.\n\nIn these congressional districts, the politicians are more responsive to their primary voters, who tend to be motivated by hot-button issues like gun rights. The price for crossing these voters is much higher than alienating those who, while perhaps more in favour of gun control, do not vote in Republican primaries.\n\nDemographics also play a part in the pro-gun sentiment in the House, as there are more rural districts with higher levels of gun ownership than there are urban ones. Racking up big pro-gun-control majorities in urban areas does little to change this political reality in the House.\n\nCould it change? Unless there\'s a flood of big-city liberals itching for the country life, demographics will be what they are. There have been some efforts to crack down on overly partisan gerrymandering, however. Barack Obama has made it one of his post-presidency goals, and the Supreme Court is currently considering a legal challenge to Wisconsin legislative districts that give a distinct advantage to Republicans. Getting politics fully out of line-drawing will be a tall task, however.\n\nThe filibuster\n\nIf a gun-control bill were to make it out of the House of Representatives, it would still face a challenge in the Senate, where the rural-urban divide plays itself out on the state level, as well. States dominated by big-city voters, such as New York, Massachusetts or California, are outnumbered by rural and Southern states with pro-gun sentiments.\n\nThe rules of the Senate can also thwart efforts to enact more stringent firearm regulation, thanks to the "filibuster" - a procedural hurdle that means most major pieces of legislation need the backing of 60 out of 100 senators to pass, rather than a simple 51-vote majority.\n\nIn 2013, following the Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting, it appeared that efforts to strengthen gun-purchase background checks had significant bipartisan support in the Senate. After a concerted lobbying effort by the NRA, however, the bill received only 56 votes in favour, four short of the mark necessary to break the filibuster.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Barack Obama’s mass shooting speeches\n\nNo gun-control measure has come close to passage since then.\n\nCould it change? Mr Trump has been perhaps the most vocal proponent of doing away with the Senate filibuster, as he views it as an obstacle to enacting his legislative agenda. A majority of senators are on the record against changing the rules, however.\n\nThe courts\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Protesters in front of the Supreme Court in 2008\n\nWith Congress more interested in rolling back existing firearm regulations than implementing new ones, left-leaning US states have taken a greater role in implementing gun-control measures.\n\nAfter the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, 21 states passed new gun laws, including imposing assault weapons bans in Connecticut, Maryland and New York.\n\nSome of the laws have run up against another barrier, however - the US judicial system. In recent years the Supreme Court has twice ruled that the right to own personal weapons such as handguns is enshrined in the constitution.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How countries around the world introduced restrictions following mass shootings\n\nThe Second Amendment says that "a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed".\n\nGun-control activists point to the introductory clause as evidence that the amendment was meant primarily to create a "well regulated" militia. In 2008, however, a sharply divided court held that the Second Amendment provides a broad right to firearm ownership that prohibits stringent registration requirement for personal weapons.\n\nSince then, lower courts have considered challenges to state-imposed assault weapon bans, registration requirements and open-carry prohibitions. So far the Supreme Court has declined to hear any of the new cases, however.\n\nCould it change? Trump-appointed Justice Neil Gorsuch has made it clear he views Second Amendment rights broadly. The president is filling out the ranks of the lower courts with pro-gun-rights judges. If anything, the judiciary is moving to the right on this issue.\n\nThe enthusiasm gap\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nPerhaps the single biggest obstacle to new gun-control laws at the national level is that opponents tend to hold fiercely to their beliefs, while support for new regulation tends to ebb and flow around each new instance of violence.\n\nThe NRA\'s strategy, and that of pro-gun politicians, is to wait out the storm - to delay legislative efforts until attention turns elsewhere and the outcry fades.\n\nPro-gun politicians offer their thoughts and prayers, observe moments of silence and order flags flown half-staff. Then, in the quiet, legislative efforts are deferred and ultimately derailed.\n\nOn Monday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters "there\'s a time and place for a political debate, but now is the time to unite as a country".\n\nMr Trump, in comments as he left the White House for Puerto Rico, said "we will be talking about gun laws as time goes by".\n\nAs time goes by. As that song from the film Casablanca says, it\'s still the same old story.\n\nCould it change? According to one poll during the 2016 presidential campaign, guns were an important issue for both Democrats and Republicans. That could be a reflection of that year\'s record-setting mass shooting in an Orlando nightclub or the first indication of a new trend.\n\nFollow Anthony Zurcher on Twitter.', 'title': "Las Vegas shooting: Five reasons US gun control won't happen", 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41489552', 'keywords': ['shooting', 'efforts', 'state', 'reasons', 'change', 'gun', 'las', 'guncontrol', 'vegas', 'happen', 'house', 'politicians', 'wont', 'republican', 'caption', 'control'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What's Donald Trump said about guns and gun control?\nIn the wake of the mass shooting in Las Vegas, gun control advocates are renewing calls for tightening regulation on firearms.\nIts overall annual budget is roughly $250m, allocated to educational programmes, gun facilities, membership events, sponsorships, legal advocacy and related efforts.\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Barack Obama’s mass shooting speechesNo gun-control measure has come close to passage since then.\nAfter the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, 21 states passed new gun laws, including imposing assault weapons bans in Connecticut, Maryland and New York.", 'date': None}, {'text': 'A LAPTOP belonging to the Las Vegas shooter has unearthed new clues in the case to establish his motive, investigators have revealed.\n\nPolice investigating Stephen Paddock, 64, over the deadliest shooting in modern US history found the computer when searching his Mandalay Bay Hotel room.

Joe Lombardo, the Las Vegas sheriff leading the investigation, shared details of the autopsy after a search of his room proved largely fruitless. He revealed that doctors found “no abnormalities” after examining his brain – ruling out yet another line of enquiry to explain his shooting spree. Lombardo said despite frustrations with the investigation, he remained determined to keep the public informed. "It’s important for people to know what I know, when I know it.

After all, most of the media didn’t publish detailed reports on those who lost their lives in the massacre. However, there’s also another reason the media must cease its incessant coverage of mass shooters: the copycat effect.\n\nIn 2015, Mother Jones reported the FBI found that those plotting an attack often look to past shootings for inspiration “in hopes of causing even greater carnage.” And the magazine found that the media’s use of the perpetrator’s name, picture and background story turns the shooter — in the words of psychologist John Van Dreal — into a hero to those who are thinking about carrying out a shooting. Potential shooters see the perpetrator’s name and face splashed all over the media and are attracted to the notoriety they can achieve by carrying out an attack.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Las Vegas massacre, too much of the media fell into the trap of covering the shooter’s life, allowing him to live on in the minds of potential attackers. While some in the media may argue that it’s necessary to examine the shooter’s life to tell the entire story of what happened, one of the central tenets of journalism is to minimize harm. And in this case, the media is doing the opposite, as its coverage makes it more likely that these tragedies will happen again in the future.\n\nInstead, the media must take concrete steps to ensure that it doesn’t fuel the copycat effect. As documented by Mother Jones, some strategies of doing this include minimizing references to the shooter’s name in stories, reducing images of the attacker and avoiding terms like “lone wolf” that glorify the shooter.\n\nNot taking these steps would be an abdication of responsible journalism, as well as a slap in the face to those whose lives have been forever changed by this horrific tragedy.', 'title': 'Media coverage of Las Vegas shooting counterproductive', 'url': 'https://theithacan.org/columns/media-coverage-of-las-vegas-shooting-counterproductive/', 'keywords': ['shooting', 'life', 'massacre', 'counterproductive', 'las', 'vegas', 'stephen', 'coverage', 'paddock', 'media', 'shooters', 'tragedy'], 'tags': {'Evan Popp', 'Meaghan McElroy', 'Jack Murray', 'Emma Whitestone', 'Bianca Mestiza', 'Mahad Olad', 'Meredith Burke'}, 'summary': 'After a mass shooting at a music festival in Las Vegas on Oct. 1 left more than 50 people dead and over 500 people injured, the media descended on the city.\nWhile much of the coverage focused on the tragedy itself and the debate over gun control, another genre emerged as well: examinations of the shooter’s life.\nThe media’s nonstop coverage of the shooter and his past was disrespectful to the victims of this tragedy.\nHowever, there’s also another reason the media must cease its incessant coverage of mass shooters: the copycat effect.\nIn the aftermath of the Las Vegas massacre, too much of the media fell into the trap of covering the shooter’s life, allowing him to live on in the minds of potential attackers.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'A laptop computer recovered from the Las Vegas hotel room where Stephen Paddock launched the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history was missing its hard drive, depriving investigators of a potential key source of information on why he killed and maimed so many people, ABC News has learned.\n\nInterested in Las Vegas Shooting?

A madman tried to change our lives,” Heller said, adding the shooter ultimately failed “because today we stand closer, stronger and more united.”\n\nSen. Catherine Cortez-Masto said Las Vegas is still a small city in some ways — many people knew someone attending the Route 91 festival. Cortez-Masto said her niece was there.\n\n“I’m angry, I’m sad,” Cortez-Masto said. “But most of all I’m so proud of our city.”\n\nParticipants in Saturday’s unity walk trekked for miles to City Hall, from all directions.

With music in the background, a voice listed the names and cities of each of the 58 victims.\n\n“Prayer is medicine after the fact,” he said. “How are we gonna prevent it?”\n\nLas Vegas will continue to be a safe place to live and visit, emphasized Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman.\n\nGoodman called the shooter “a horrific, senseless animal,” and said she “will never mention that name.”\n\n“We will not be defined by hate. Violence. We will not be defined by anger,” Goodman said. “And we will not be defined by fear.”\n\nContact Jamie Munks at jmunks@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0354. Follow @JamieMunksRJ on Twitter.

Richard Brian Las Vegas Review-Journal @vegasphotograph\n\nMore than 450 victims of the Oct. 1 massacre in Las Vegas have filed a lawsuit in California against MGM Resorts International and other defendants, including the gunman’s estate.\n\nThe lawsuit includes two wrongful death claims, while lawyers involved in the litigation also have filed other complaints in Los Angeles, according to a news release from the Texas-based firm Abraham, Watkins, Nichols, Sorrels, Agosto & Aziz.\n\nAmong five complaints filed Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court, one names hundreds of victims from Nevada, California and 19 other states, along with victims from Canada.\n\nAlleging negligence, the suit claims that MGM had a “duty of reasonable care” and failed to properly monitor the people entering and leaving the Mandalay Bay suite from which shooter Stephen Paddock fired upon a crowd of thousands at the Route 91 Harvest festival, killing 58 and leaving more than 500 injured.\n\nAlong with the hotel-casino giant and Paddock’s estate, defendants include MGM Resorts Festival Grounds LLC, Live Nation Entertainment Inc. and Contemporary Services Corp., a security company.\n\nThrough Paddock’s VIP status with the resort company, he was allowed “exclusive access” to a service elevator at Mandalay Bay, which gave him the means to “stockpile weapons and ammunition in his hotel suite over the days leading up to the mass shooting,” the lawsuit states.\n\nThe complaint references a “do not disturb” sign that hung on the door of the gunman’s suite for days without staff checking on the room, along with security cameras he placed on a hotel room door, in a service cart and in the hallway of the 32nd floor where the room was located “to prolong his shooting spree.”\n\nAccording to the suit, MGM acted negligently in several ways: failing to monitor the hotel premises with a closed-circuit television, failing to respond to the shooting of security officer Jesus Campos, failing to notice or take precautions against Paddock’s delivery of guns and ammunition to his hotel room, failing to adequately prevent or discover broken windows; failing to train employees on suspicious activity, and ignoring the “do not disturb” sign.\n\nIn a statement, MGM said: “The incident that took place on October 1st was a terrible tragedy perpetrated by an evil man. These kinds of lawsuits are not unexpected and we intend to defend ourselves against them. That said, out of respect for the victims, we will give our response through the appropriate legal channels.”\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Live Nation, which controlled the concert venue, did not adequately mark exits or properly train workers on an “appropriate plan of action in the case of a foreseeable event, such as a terrorist attack or other emergency.”\n\nAgainst Paddock’s estate, the lawsuit claims assault, battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nAnother lawsuit, initially filed in Clark County by Paige Gasper, a California woman who also was injured in the shooting, has been transferred to Los Angeles, according to court documents.\n\nSeparate suits also were filed by the families of Christopher Roybal, a 28-year-old Navy combat veteran from Colorado Springs, and Rocio Guillen Rocha, a 40-year-old mother of four, who died after being struck by gunfire while attending the concert. A fifth lawsuit names Kristina Staples, another California woman, who suffered a gunshot wound and remained in a coma for weeks after the shooting.\n\nContact David Ferrara at dferrara@reviewjournal.com or 702-380-1039.

Facebook, for instance, previously had a team of trained news editors who chose which stories appeared in its trending topics section, a huge driver of traffic to news stories. But it disbanded the group and instituted an automated process last year, after reports surfaced that the editors were suppressing conservative news sites. The change seems to have made the problem worse — earlier this year, Facebook redesigned the trending topics section again, after complaints that hoaxes and fake news stories were showing up in users’ feeds.\n\nThere is also a labeling issue. A Facebook user looking for news about the Las Vegas shooting on Monday morning, or a Google user searching for information about the wrongfully accused shooter, would have found posts from 4Chan and Sputnik alongside articles by established news organizations like CNN and NBC News, with no obvious cues to indicate which ones came from reliable sources.\n\nMore thoughtful design could help solve this problem, and Facebook has already begun to label some disputed stories with the help of professional fact checkers. But fixes that require identifying “reputable” news organizations are inherently risky because they open companies up to accusations of favoritism. (After Facebook announced its fact-checking effort, which included working with The Associated Press and Snopes, several right-wing activists complained of left-wing censorship.)\n\nThe automation of editorial judgment, combined with tech companies’ reluctance to appear partisan, has created a lopsided battle between those who want to spread misinformation and those tasked with policing it. Posting a malicious rumor on Facebook, or writing a false news story that is indexed by Google, is a nearly instantaneous process; removing such posts often requires human intervention. This imbalance gives an advantage to rule-breakers, and makes it impossible for even an army of well-trained referees to keep up.\n\nBut just because the war against misinformation may be unwinnable doesn’t mean it should be avoided. Roughly two-thirds of American adults get news from social media, which makes the methods these platforms use to vet and present information a matter of national importance.\n\nFacebook, Twitter and Google are some of the world’s richest and most ambitious companies, but they still have not shown that they’re willing to bear the costs — or the political risks — of fixing the way misinformation spreads on their platforms. (Some executives appear resolute in avoiding the discussion. In a recent Facebook post, Mark Zuckerberg reasserted the platform’s neutrality, saying that being accused of partisan bias by both sides is “what running a platform for all ideas looks like.”)\n\nThe investigations into Russia’s exploitation of social media during the 2016 presidential election will almost certainly continue for months. But dozens of less splashy online misinformation campaigns are happening every day, and they deserve attention, too. Tech companies should act decisively to prevent hoaxes and misinformation from spreading on their platforms, even if it means hiring thousands more moderators or angering some partisan organizations.\n\nFacebook and Google have spent billions of dollars developing virtual reality systems.

The misidentification spread rapidly from dark corners of the internet to mainstream platforms just hours after hundreds were injured at a festival near the Mandalay Bay casino, the latest example of fake news polluting social media amid a breaking news story.\n\nThe flow of misinformation on Monday illustrated a particularly grim trend that has increasingly dominated viral online propaganda during US mass shootings – hyper-partisan trolls battling to blame the tragedy on opposing political ideologies.\n\nLas Vegas police name suspect in deadly attack Read more\n\nPolice have identified Stephen Paddock as the suspect who opened fire from a high-rise hotel room, killing scores and injuring hundreds more. But before authorities named the 64-year-old Nevada man, some on the far right falsely identified the man behind the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history as Geary Danley. It’s unclear where exactly the hoax originated, but rightwing users aggressively promoted his name, seizing on evidence that he was a liberal.\n\nOn 4chan, the anonymous message board and a favorite platform of the “alt-right”, some noted that Danley was a registered Democrat. Soon after, Gateway Pundit, a conspiracy-laden blog that earned White House credentials under Trump, published an evidence-free story headlined, “Las Vegas Shooter Reportedly a Democrat Who Liked Rachel Maddow, MoveOn.org and Associated with Anti-Trump Army”. The piece was based on a review of Facebook “likes”.\n\nPlay Video 1:55 ‘People started dropping around us’: Las Vegas shooting told by witnesses - video report\n\nDespite the fact that the claims were unproven and coming from non-credible sources, Facebook’s “Safety Check” page, which is supposed to help people connect with loved ones during the crisis, ended up briefly promoting a story that said the shooter had “Trump-hating” views, along with links to a number of other hoaxes and scams, according to screenshots. At the same time, Google users who searched Geary Danley’s name were at one point directed to the 4chan thread filled with false claims.\n\nThe rightwing users’ successful manipulation of social media algorithms to politicize a tragedy speaks to a relatively new pattern of online abuse. While users of Twitter and Reddit memorably misidentified the suspect behind the Boston marathon bombing in 2013, fake news during global tragedies and terrorist attacks over the last year has increasingly gone beyond careless reporting and retweeting to overt exploitation and targeted disinformation campaigns.\n\n“It’s getting more polarized. There’s this mad scramble to paint the guy as a Democrat or a Republican, so they can cheer,” Brooke Binkowski, managing editor of fact-checking website Snopes.com, said in an interview. “A lot of this is pushed by trolls deliberately to muddy the conversation.”\n\nFalse content can quickly move from social media to legitimate news sources, she added: “People are putting out crap information on purpose … It’s really easy to get shit into the news cycle by being on Twitter.”\n\n1,516 mass shootings in 1,735 days: America's gun crisis – in one chart Read more\n\nWhile authorities have struggled to identify the possible motives of Paddock, the suspect who police believe killed himself, some far-right users and conspiracy theorists have, without any proof, attempted to link him to anti-fascist groups and the leftist Antifa movement. Infowars, the hyper-partisan site known for propaganda, claimed on Monday that Paddock was found with “antifa literature”. At the same time, a sham Facebook page pretending to be Antifa claimed responsibility for the attack, saying the goal of the shooter was to murder “Trump supporting fascist dogs”.\n\nA YouTube user also pushed an unsubstantiated rumor that the suspect was a Hillary Clinton supporter.\n\nOn the flipside, some conservatives on Twitter have theorized that leftwing social media users have attempted to falsely paint Paddock as a rightwing individual. Some have speculated that liberals are posing as white nationalists and Trump supporters and following a Twitter account that has the same name as the suspect, in hopes of proving he is a conservative.\n\nIn reality, the suspect had no known “affiliations” that could explain the massacre, according to one of his brothers, who spoke out on Monday.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Donald Trump makes remarks at the White House on the mass shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock\n\nGoogle, Facebook and Twitter have faced repeated accusations that they allow propaganda to spread on their sites and reach large audiences, and in the wake of embarrassing stories of promoting fake news and offensive content, the tech corporations have typically blamed their algorithms and offered vague pledges of improvement.\n\nThe Mandalay Bay shooting was no exception. Google said in a statement: “Unfortunately, early this morning we were briefly surfacing an inaccurate 4chan website in our Search results for a small number of queries. Within hours, the 4chan story was algorithmically replaced by relevant results. This should not have appeared for any queries, and we’ll continue to make algorithmic improvements to prevent this from happening in the future.”\n\nLas Vegas gunman may have used special device to fire faster, expert says Read more\n\nFacebook attempted to downplay its role in promoting false stories, saying in a statement: “Our Global Security Operations Center spotted these posts this morning and we have removed them. However, their removal was delayed, allowing them to be screen captured and circulated online. We are working to fix the issue that allowed this to happen in the first place and deeply regret the confusion this caused.”\n\nBinkowski noted that the online debates about possible political affiliations of the suspect distract from meaningful policy discussions about gun control.\n\n“People would rather debate whether the mass shooter is a Republican or Democrat … than address structural issues,” she said.\n\nBeyond the politically charged fake news, a wide range of hoaxes and irresponsible reporting clouded social media on Monday. A number of viral tweets posted fake accounts of missing victims, according to BuzzFeed.\n\nSome celebrities were also quick to spread unverified claims before police had offered any official confirmation of the basic facts of the shooting.

He just didn’t care. He loved country, and he drove a big huge Dodge [truck] — that was his baby. He was a country boy through and through.\n\n“We decided to wear something Canadian [to the festival]. On the first night he wore his Canadian tuxedo, which was jean-on-jean and it cut off the sleeves, with these boots that he never took off. And he wore this bandanna.”\n\nThe couple had traveled to Vegas to celebrate both of their birthdays (she turned 23 last weekend, his was coming up on Friday).\n\nVanderpol lit up as she described their weekend getaway.\n\n“It was an amazing weekend,” she said. “Before it all happened, we had the greatest day. We went out for lunch, and we were singing to each other and we were dancing.\n\n“Just to be able to go again and to walk the strip, to see everything and take a bunch of pictures… it was a great trip.”\n\nThe festival itself was a highlight for both of them.\n\n“Everyone was having a good time, everyone was singing and dancing,” she said. “We were all coming together for the love of country music.”\n\nWATCH: Gunman fired for about 9 to 11 minutes: Las Vegas police\n\n‘We’re not done’\n\nThen, on Sunday night, everything changed.\n\n“We were dancing and singing, because we were both big fans of Jason Aldean [who was performing at the time], and then we heard the shots,” she said. “We’ve been around guns so we knew what was going on.\n\n“We started to run, and he covered me, and he saved me.”\n\nREAD MORE: Las Vegas shooting: Canadians among 59 dead, over 500 injured after attack at music festival\n\nThe couple ran for cover against a table near a bar, and McIldoon made sure to keep Vanderpol away from the line of fire as best as he could.\n\nSuddenly, he told his girlfriend that he had been shot.\n\n“I rolled him over,” Vanderpol said. “I wanted to see it. In all the chaos that was going on, I was trying to look at it, trying to get him to talk to me, trying to make sure he was still conscious.\n\n“I constantly, constantly told him, ‘I love you, I love you. You can’t go anywhere, we’re not done.'”\n\nAn off-duty paramedic rushed over to the couple and assisted. Vanderpol said they took turns giving McIldoon CPR.\n\n“I gave him his last breaths,” she said.\n\n“His last words to me after being shot were, ‘I love you.’ And that is something that I will never forget.”\n\nVanderpol was then ripped away from her boyfriend’s body — the danger wasn’t over, and first responders were evacuating as many people as they could.\n\n“Nobody knew where the shooter was. They wanted us all to be safe, and I know that’s what he would have wanted,” she said.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘I couldn’t leave him’: Las Vegas bartender recounts how she held dying B.C. man’s hand\n\nWATCH: Law enforcement and family members still cannot explain what would motivate a one-time accountant with no known criminal record to carry out the attack that left 59 dead and wounded just under 500 others\n\n‘We were going to get married’\n\nNow back home in Maple Ridge, Vanderpol is left with memories of the kind, loving person she had planned to marry.\n\n“He was the love of my life, and he made sure that I knew that I was his,” she said. “We only had just shy of two years, but honestly they were the best two years of my entire life.\n\n“We started dating a day after we met, and we both just knew that we were going to get married and have kids. We had all this planned out. On my birthday we talked about what our wedding would be like, and what the rest of our life would look like.\n\n“It was going to be incredible, it really was.”\n\nVanderpol smiled and laughed as she remembered McIldoon and the good times they had together: how much he loved his construction job, how excited he was to finish school this year and obtain his Red Seal “so we could go anywhere we wanted to,” and how he’d try and lighten the mood in any situation. Even this one.\n\n“He would make some stupid, funny comment to try and lighten the mood,” she said when asked what he’d do if he had survived that night. “That’s just what he did.”\n\nREAD MORE: ‘From a young age, he was fearless’: Statement from B.C. family on Las Vegas shooting victim\n\nShe also made clear repeatedly that McIldoon was a hero, and not just for what he did for her that night.\n\n“He was just the most genuine, kind person, and would give the shirt off his back for someone in need,” she said. “That’s just the way he was, and that’s what I loved about him. His mom said if he wasn’t injured, we both would have been trying to help people.\n\n“He saved me in so many ways other than just this event. He taught me how to love, he taught me how to be a good person. He was the love of my life. No one could ever say anything bad about him.\n\n“He had it in his head that everyone thought he was this big, scary redneck, but he was honestly one of the most amazing people I have ever met in my whole life.”\n\nAs Vanderpol tries to move on from “the most traumatic thing in my entire life I will ever have to go through,” she shared a message for anyone lucky enough to have the kind of love for someone that she and McIldoon had for each other.\n\n“We really loved each other, and if anyone could ever feel the way we felt about each other, you just hold onto them really tightly.

Campos is considered a central witness in the criminal investigation into the shooting and in civil lawsuits against MGM Resorts and other companies connected to the shooting.\n\nHis account of the horrific Oct. 1 events became the subject of national media attention after Las Vegas police made multiple changes to the sequence of events in the shooting. Campos then disappeared from public view.\n\nFlansburg told the Review-Journal last week that Campos had spent most of his time staying at an undisclosed MGM property since his name became public, except for several days in Mexico on a pre-planned and company-approved trip to visit family.\n\n“Following the tragedy, Mr. Campos’ name was publicly released, resulting in extensive and intrusive media attention,” Flansburg said. “Because of the unwanted attention days after the event, MGM Resorts offered Mr. Campos lodging for his privacy and protection, which Mr. Campos accepted and appreciated.”\n\nLaw enforcement officers interviewed Campos at a hospital and approved his trip to Mexico, Flansburg said.\n\nCampos was the first to encounter gunman Stephen Paddock at his Mandalay Bay suite on the night of Oct. 1. Paddock shot him in the leg through the door.\n\nAbout the same time, the shooter began firing at roughly 22,000 people across the street at the Route 91 Harvest music festival.\n\nCampos appeared on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” last month after he had dodged planned interviews with five news programs.

Sheriff Joseph Lombardo, in his first TV appearance in nearly three weeks, told KLAS that investigators he’s spoken to believe this assessment is accurate. But he added that something appears to be off about the manner in which Paddock amassed his arsenal of weapons.\n\n\n\n“There is a lot of people that have hundreds and hundreds of guns, but for this individual to do it at a certain point in time and to do it all with such robust action, you would think that Ms. Danley would have some information associated with that,” he said. “But currently we haven’t been able to pull that out of her, if it’s in her.”\n\nLombardo added that Danley will be interviewed again this week and he suggested she could have prevented the massacre, which left 58 dead and hundreds injured.\n\n“It could have been prevented on many levels,” Lombardo told KLAS’ George Knapp. “Marilou Danley, his brother, anybody that may have had some modicum of information that would have presented this individual’s state of mind, but apparently right now we don’t know that.”\n\nNEWS ORGANIZATIONS FILE LAWSUITS ALLEGING LAS VEGAS OFFICIALS ARE VIOLATING PUBLIC RECORDS LAW\n\nDanley was in the Philippines at the time of the attack and Paddock wired $100,000 to an account in the country days earlier, according to past reports.\n\nNo motive for the Oct. 1 shooting has been revealed yet, but Lombardo said that since September 2015, Paddock – a high-rolling gambler – had lost a significant amount of wealth.\n\n“I think that might have a determining factor on what he determined to do,” Lombardo said.\n\nThe sheriff said Paddock was narcissistic, had some bouts of depression and was very status-driven, based on how he liked to be recognized in the casinos and by his family and friends, which was starting to decline.\n\nPaddock fired off more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition from his room at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino and had access to over 4,000 more, Lombardo told KLAS.\n\nThe shooting spree stopped after, according to Lombardo’s belief, Paddock realized the authorities were closing in.\n\n“I believe the suspect believed the wolf was at the door and took his own life,” Lombardo said.\n\nA hard drive that was missing from one of Paddock’s laptops found in the room after police entered has still not been recovered.\n\n“The hard drive was not located in the room,” Lombardo said. “We may never know where that hard drive is.

Mental health support has also been made available to hospital staff.\n\n“I think that everyone valley-wide is just coping with this,” Cooper said. “A lot of what you see in the beginning is you don’t really have time to process what’s going on, because you’re immediately treating patients who need your care.”\n\nSunrise posted a video statement on Twitter from one of its emergency physicians Wednesday praising the staff for its coordinated response.\n\n“We worked together as one unit — almost like an octopus with multiple tentacles,” Dr. Kevin Menes said. “We had anyone from EKG (electrocardiogram) staff, CNAs (certified nursing assistants), anybody who can man a gurney, man a wheelchair, pulling these patients out of these cars.”\n\nContact Jessie Bekker at jbekker@reviewjournal.com or 702-380-4563.

Hundreds rolled up their sleeves\n\nDespite the seeming chaos, hospitals and cities plan for big disasters, said Jack Rozdilsky, professor of disaster and emergency management at York University. “When these things take place it’s not a state of pure chaos, it’s a state of organized chaos where specific first responders have plans, they’ve been trained, and unfortunately expect these types of events to happen.”\n\nHere’s how he says medical authorities handle mass casualty events:\n\n1. Triage\n\nIn the case of a mass shooting, you could expect a variety of injuries, from direct and indirect bullet wounds and broken bones to cuts, scrapes and stampeding injuries, said Rozdilsky. Different kinds of incidents, like a plane crash for example, would have different kinds of expected injuries.\n\nWhen paramedics arrive at the scene, they would have to triage the patients – trying to determine who most urgently needs medical care.\n\n“It’s slightly grotesque but it would be important to sort out who’s already dead, who’s not in need of aid, versus those who can survive. That would need to be the first cut,” he said.\n\n“Once that is done, the first responders go to aid the people who they have a chance of saving.”\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Lucky to be alive’ Toronto woman recounts running for her life during Las Vegas shooting\n\nEmergency responders would rank people using information like their type of injury, their age (very young and very old people would likely get priority) and their level of consciousness. Then, they would usually give people a tag with some basic information on their injuries and try to get them to hospital.\n\nWATCH: Manitoba woman injured during Las Vegas mass shooting recounts experience\n\n2. Transport\n\nFestivals, as part of their preparation, generally set up areas where ambulances can arrive in case of emergency. So as emergency responders work to triage victims, hundreds of ambulances might be rounded up to take people to hospital and are sent to the “staging” area. There, they’re loaded up with patients and start making runs to hospitals.\n\nREAD MORE: What we know about Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock\n\nDifferent hospitals might have different specialties, said Rozdilsky. Some are designated trauma centres and would likely receive the bulk of cases in a manmade or natural disaster. But some hospitals handle crush injuries, or children’s hospitals would take pediatric cases. All of this would be worked out beforehand so that emergency services would know where to take people.\n\n3. Hospital care\n\nOnce they arrive at the hospital, patients would once again be triaged and prioritized based on the extent of their injuries. All available doctors would be called and most likely, elective surgeries would be cancelled to free up space for emergency patients.\n\nSunrise Hospital UPDATE: All non-emergent care has been postponed. — Sunrise Hospital (@SunriseLasVegas) October 2, 2017\n\nThe hospital would decide who needed to go to surgery immediately, who needed to go to intensive care immediately and determine whether people can wait for other treatments.\n\nWATCH: Edmonton, Las Vegas incidents “very rare”: security expert\n\nBut a hospital’s emergency plan wouldn’t just be about receiving patients via ambulance, said Rozdilsky. In this kind of event, people would also be driving themselves or others to the hospital or even walking in. So, the hospital would have to have people waiting at various entrances to process these patients and get them into the triage queue as well.\n\nREAD MORE: Nevada has some of the most relaxed gun laws in America\n\nNot only that, but panicking families would be contacting the hospital or walking into the emergency room, looking for lists of patients to see whether their loved ones are there.

Add Interest\n\n— At least 59 people, including the shooter, died after Sunday night\'s mass shooting at a Las Vegas music festival. — The motive remains unknown, but police say the attack was "obviously premeditated." — The gunman, Stephen Paddock, may have planned to escape the scene. — A note authorities found in Paddock\'s hotel was not a suicide note. — Paddock visited several music festivals in the Las Vegas area. — Paddock booked hotel rooms in Chicago in August overlooking the Lollapalooza music festival. — Paddock was seen gambling for eight hours straight on the night before the shooting. — Paddock was seen with another woman, who was not his girlfriend, in the days before the shooting.\n\nSuspect may have visited other music festivals\n\nOfficials briefed on the investigation into alleged Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock told ABC News that Paddock booked hotel rooms in Chicago in early August during the Lollapalooza music festival. One of the hotels where he had reservations was the Blackstone on South Michigan Avenue, across from Grant Park, where the annual event took place.\n\nThe Chicago Police Department said in a statement Thursday, "We are aware of the media reports and have been in communication with our federal partners. As you saw earlier this week the city conducts extensive public safety planning and training around major events, in close coordination with our law enforcement partners, to ensure public safety."\n\nA source with the Chicago Police Department confirmed for ABC News that Paddock had reservations at the Blackstone hotel.\n\nHowever, a spokesman for the Blackstone told ABC News in a statement today, "We can confirm that there was no guest under [Paddock\'s] name who stayed at our hotel in August during the Lollapalooza music festival. We are cooperating with the authorities on this matter."\n\nIt\'s unclear whether Paddock traveled to Chicago at that time.\n\nOfficials briefed on the investigation also told ABC News that Paddock may have visited several music festivals in the greater Las Vegas area over the past several months. All the venues are believed to have been within driving distance of Las Vegas.\n\nPaddock is also believed to have made regular trips to the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino starting Sept. 3 and through the rest of the month. He was known at most of the big casinos on the Las Vegas Strip because he was a major player who visited the casinos a lot, the officials said.\n\nInvestigators are also looking into whether Paddock tried to secure a room at El Cortez Hotel and Casino, at the opposite end of the Strip from the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino, on the weekend that the Life Is Beautiful music festival took place, from Sept. 22 to Sept. 24, the officials told ABC News.\n\nDuring the Wednesday news conference, Lombardo confirmed that Paddock rented a room that weekend at the Ogden hotel in downtown Las Vegas. Authorities have recovered items and surveillance video from when he stayed there, Lombardo said.\n\nPaul Buck/EPA\n\nPaddock also searched for hotels near Fenway Park in Boston, though there is no indication that he traveled there, sources briefed on the investigation told ABC News.\n\nThe Boston Police Department said in a statement today, "We are aware of the media reports referencing a Boston connection to the Las Vegas mass shooting incident that occurred on Sunday, Oct. 1, 2017. The Boston Regional Intelligence Center is in contact with our local and federal law enforcement partners here and in Las Vegas and continues to monitor the situation. There is currently no known threat to the Metro Boston homeland security region related to this incident."\n\nMeticulous planning preceded \'premeditated\' shooting\n\nAs investigators delve deeper into how Sunday night\'s massacre in Las Vegas unfolded, more chilling details have emerged about the suspected gunman and how he carried out the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.\n\nAuthorities said Paddock opened fire on a music festival crowd from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, killing 58 people and injuring 489 others — a decrease from original reports, after officials double-checked numbers. More than 22,000 people were attending the final night of the Route 91 Harvest Festival when gunfire erupted.\n\nThe shooting lasted nine to 11 minutes, with the first reports of gunshots beginning Sunday at 10:05 p.m. PT and the final shots being fired at 10:15 p.m., authorities said. It\'s believed that Paddock was the sole shooter in the attack.\n\nAP\n\nBut Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told a news conference Wednesday night there are indications that Paddock, a 64-year-old resident of Mesquite, Nevada, may have had some kind of help.\n\nLombardo also said there is evidence that indicates he planned to escape the scene. But the sheriff did not provide any details on what the evidence was or why he believes that.\n\nPaddock checked into the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino on Sept. 28 with 10 bags and at least 23 guns, including high-power rifles. He set up surveillance cameras inside and outside his two-room suite.\n\nThere were two cameras on a room service cart in the hallway outside his suite, one on the peephole of the door to his room and a baby monitor in the living room. None of the cameras were recording, police said.\n\nAP\n\nPaddock was shuttered inside his suite for three days at the giant hotel-casino, perched high above the site of the Route 91 Harvest Festival, which was taking place across the street. Room service was provided at some point during his stay, police said.\n\nInvestigators believe Paddock used a device similar to a hammer to smash two windows in his room before he opened fire on the music festival crowd, shortly after a rendition of "God Bless America."\n\nPolice responded to the hotel room, where Paddock was found dead. He is believed to have killed himself before police entered.\n\nJohn Locher/AP\n\nLaw enforcement sources told ABC News that Paddock possibly set up the cameras to monitor for approaching authorities.\n\n"I anticipate he was looking for anybody coming to take him into custody," Lombardo said at a news conference Tuesday.\n\nAuthorities also found a note in Paddock\'s hotel room but said it was not a suicide note. The contents of the note are unknown.\n\nWhile the motives behind the deadly rampage remain unclear, Lombardo said the attack was "obviously premeditated" and "meticulously planned," and that the shooter "evaluated everything he did." Investigators are still combing through the life of Paddock, whom Lombardo described at the Wednesday news conference as a "disturbed and dangerous" man who had led a "secret life."\n\nSen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told a news conference Wednesday that the shooting "doesn\'t seem to have a terrorism nexus."\n\nDavid Becker/Getty Images\n\nABC News has obtained images from inside Paddock\'s hotel room. A body, believed to be Paddock\'s, is partly visibly in one of the photos.\n\nThe images also show rifles and bullet shells scattered across the floor, with high-capacity magazines stacked like bricks in a corner.\n\nWARNING: Images may be disturbing to some readers.\n\nObtained by ABC\n\nObtained by ABC\n\nObtained by ABC\n\nAn employee at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino told ABC News she spent a total of 16 hours serving Paddock in the casino during her shifts there over the weekend. She said she watched him gamble for eight hours straight, from Saturday night to Sunday morning.\n\nHe played high-stakes video poker on machines in a separate, "exclusive" section of the casino, she said.\n\nAs soon as she saw Paddock\'s picture on the news, identifying him as the suspected gunman, she said she knew it was the man who was her customer the night before the shooting.\n\nA \'plethora\' of guns and ammo\n\nAuthorities have executed search warrants at three locations and for Paddock\'s vehicle parked at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.\n\nIn addition to the 23 guns recovered from Paddock\'s hotel room — which police said were purchased in Nevada, California, Utah and Texas — authorities found a computer and several pieces of media there. Law enforcement sources said multiple loaded high-capacity magazines and a modified bump stock rifle, which allows a gun to simulate rapid automatic gunfire, were discovered in the room as well.\n\nInvestigators are still in the process of examining the firearms to determine whether they were capable of firing automatically.\n\nABC News\n\nMeanwhile, 50 pounds of an explosive and about 1,600 rounds of ammunition were discovered in Paddock\'s car.\n\nExplosive material and 19 additional firearms were also found at Paddock\'s home in a Mesquite retirement community.\n\nFive handguns, two shotguns, numerous electronics and a "plethora of ammunition" were recovered from his property in Reno, according to Lombardo.\n\nEric Paddock via AP\n\nJill Snyder, the special agent in charge at the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, told "CBS This Morning" in an interview Wednesday that Paddock had been stockpiling firearms since 1982. He bought nearly 50 guns legally, she said, but none of those purchases set off any red flags for the ATF.\n\n"From October 2016 to Sept. 28, 2017, he purchased 33 firearms, majority of them rifles," Snyder said. "We wouldn\'t get notified of the purchases of the rifles. We would only get notified if there was a multiple sale, which would be two or more handguns in an individual purchase."\n\nSuspect\'s girlfriend arrives back in US for questioning\n\nInvestigators say Paddock\'s longtime girlfriend, Marilou Danley, who lived with him at his home in Mesquite, is more than a mere witness.\n\n"Currently she\'s a person of interest," Lombardo told a news conference Tuesday.\n\nDanley, 62, returned to the United States from the Philippines, where she was born, landing at Los Angeles International Airport on Tuesday night at 7:17 p.m. PT on Philippine Air Flight 102.\n\nShe was taken out a back way so she wouldn\'t be seen in public, and FBI agents met her upon landing, multiple law enforcement sources told ABC News.\n\nThe law offices of Matthew Lombard confirmed to ABC News on Wednesday afternoon that Danley was at the FBI field office in Los Angeles with Lombard, who is representing her. He said his client is cooperating with authorities in the investigation.\n\nObtained by ABC News\n\nAt a news conference later, Lombard read a statement from Danley, in which she said she knew Paddock as a "kind, caring man" and she was not aware that "something horrible like this was going to happen."\n\n"I loved him and hoped for a quiet future together with him," the statement said. "It never occurred to me in any way whatsoever that he was planning violence against anyone."\n\nDanley is not in custody and is free to go where she pleases. Investigators are hoping she can shed some light on the motivations behind Paddock\'s attack, but even a few months before the shooting, Paddock and Danley’s relationship at least appeared to be on solid ground.\n\nDanley accompanied Paddock to a Reno car dealership in August, where Paddock purchased a vehicle with a check for $14,411. When Danley went on a test drive, she told a saleswoman that Paddock had saved her from a troubled marriage.\n\n“She said she had a bad relationship prior to him,” the saleswoman told ABC News. “And how he had turned her life around. Really helped her out.”\n\nIn an interview with ABC News on Wednesday, her elder brother Reynaldo Bustos said he immediately contacted her when he saw the news that her boyfriend was responsible for the massacre in Las Vegas.\n\n"I called her up immediately, and she said, \'Relax. We shouldn\'t worry about it. I\'ll fix it. Do not panic. I have a clean conscience,\'" Bustos said outside Manila in Tagalog, his native language.\n\nObtained by ABC News\n\nMystery woman seen with suspect before shooting\n\nOfficials briefed on the investigation told ABC News that investigators believe Paddock was seen with another woman, who was not his girlfriend, in the days before Sunday night\'s shooting.\n\nInvestigators are working to identify the woman and are interested in speaking with her to find out whether she has any insight, the officials said.\n\nABC News\' Brian Ross, Cindy Galli, Anna Marie Cerezo, Jack Date, Andy Fies, Matt Gutman, James Hill, Aaron Katersky, Meghan Keneally, Jonah Lustig, Josh Margolin, Bonnie McLean, Alex Stone and Pierre Thomas contributed to this report.', 'title': 'Las Vegas shooter booked hotel overlooking Lollapalooza, visited other music festivals', 'url': 'https://abcnews.go.com/US/las-vegas-shooter-booked-hotel-overlooking-lollapalooza-visited/story?id=50273390', 'keywords': ['shooting', 'told', 'hotel', 'abc', 'music', 'paddocks', 'shooter', 'las', 'vegas', 'overlooking', 'booked', 'paddock', 'lollapalooza', 'room', 'festivals', 'visited'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': "Here's the latest on the investigation into the Las Vegas shooting:Interested in Las Vegas Shooting?\nAdd Las Vegas Shooting as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Las Vegas Shooting news, video, and analysis from ABC News.\nAdd Interest— At least 59 people, including the shooter, died after Sunday night's mass shooting at a Las Vegas music festival.\nSuspect may have visited other music festivalsOfficials briefed on the investigation into alleged Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock told ABC News that Paddock booked hotel rooms in Chicago in early August during the Lollapalooza music festival.\nAuthorities also found a note in Paddock's hotel room but said it was not a suicide note.", 'date': None}, {'text': 'CBS legal executive Hayley Geftman-Gold has been fired for making insensitive remarks about the victims of the Las Vegas shooting, the deadliest shooting in modern US history.\n\n“If they wouldn’t do anything when children were murdered I have no hope that Repugs will ever do the right thing," Geftman-Gold wrote in comments that have since been deleted from her Facebook page.

Eric Paddock also said his brother had made a fortune as a property developer and recently sent his 90-year-old mother a Zimmer frame.\n\nHe described his brother as a gambler who played slot machines and video poker on the Strip while living in retirement.\n\nThe brother also said that their father was bank robber Benjamin Hoskins Paddock, who was on the FBI\'s 10 most wanted list until 1977.\n\nDescribed as an avid gambler, he spent nearly a decade as a fugitive after springing from a Texan prison in 1968, the Arizona Republic reported at the time.\n\nAn FBI poster described him as a "psychopath" who should be treated as "armed and very dangerous".\n\nStephen Paddock lived in Mesquite, Nevada, 80 miles north east of Las Vegas, with 62-year-old Marilou Danley, who had been his partner.\n\nGuns and ammunition were found in a search of Paddock\'s "nice, clean" home, a Mesquite Police spokesman said.\n\nEric Paddock, telling reporters his brother had made millions in property, said he was not aware of his brother having any recent financial difficulties and that he had recently sent the walking aid to their mother.\n\nPaddock is believed to have killed himself before a police Swat team burst into his room at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino, where at least 10 "rifles" were found, Clark County sheriff Joseph Lombardo said.\n\n"We have no investigative information or background associated with this individual that is derogatory," he added. The motive for the attack on the Route 91 Harvest Festival remains unclear, with FBI special agent Aaron Rouse saying Paddock had no connection to an international terrorist organisation.\n\nHis comment came after Islamic State, which is known to have made false and exaggerated claims in the past, claimed Paddock was a "soldier" who had recently converted to Islam.\n\nPaddock\'s former brother-in-law Scott Brunoehler also expressed his shock at his involvement.\n\n"He seemed like a normal, good guy. I don\'t remember anything bad back then at all," the 62-year-old told the LA Times of the man married to his sister until the 1980s.\n\n"I\'m still in shock."\n\nBelfast Telegraph', 'title': "Las Vegas killer Paddock's family in shock over millionaire mass killer", 'url': 'https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/las-vegas-killer-paddocks-family-in-shock-over-millionaire-mass-killer-36190941.html', 'keywords': ['shock', 'robber', 'recently', 'paddocks', 'mass', 'las', 'vegas', 'killer', 'family', 'paddock', 'millionaire', 'wanted', 'brother', 'list', 'history'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Las Vegas killer Paddock\'s family in shock over millionaire mass killer BelfastTelegraph.co.uk The multi-millionaire gunman responsible for the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history was the son of a bank robber once on the FBI\'s most wanted list, according to his family.\nStephen Paddock (64) was named by police as the gunman who massacred at least 58 people on the Las Vegas Strip.\n"We have no idea how this happened," the 55-year-old who lives in Orlando, Florida, added to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.\nThe brother also said that their father was bank robber Benjamin Hoskins Paddock, who was on the FBI\'s 10 most wanted list until 1977.\nStephen Paddock lived in Mesquite, Nevada, 80 miles north east of Las Vegas, with 62-year-old Marilou Danley, who had been his partner.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'At least 20 people were killed and more than 100 wounded when a gunman opened fire on a country music concert in Las Vegas on Sunday, police said.\n\n“We have in excess of 100-plus injured and excess of 20-plus that have died at this point,” Las Vegas Metro Police Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told a press conference.\n\nThe gunman, who was a local man, was killed after police “engaged the suspect,” Lombardo told reporters.\n\nAFP', 'title': 'At Least 20 Dead In Las Vegas Shooting', 'url': 'https://www.channelstv.com/2017/10/02/least-20-dead-las-vegas-shooting-police/', 'keywords': ['shooting', 'told', 'lombardo', 'wounded', '20', 'las', 'vegas', 'killed', 'suspect', 'dead', 'excess', 'gunman', 'sheriff'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'At least 20 people were killed and more than 100 wounded when a gunman opened fire on a country music concert in Las Vegas on Sunday, police said.\n“We have in excess of 100-plus injured and excess of 20-plus that have died at this point,” Las Vegas Metro Police Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told a press conference.\nThe gunman, who was a local man, was killed after police “engaged the suspect,” Lombardo told reporters.', 'date': 1506902400}, {'text': 'A gunman opened fire at Las Vegas’ Route 91 Harvest Festival last night, killing 59 people and injuring approximately 515 people, according to reports from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.
