(Read more: Why Gun Sales Often Rise After Mass Shootings .)\n\nThe Sandy Hook shooting has "created a national shortage" of firearms and ammunition, one Texas gun shop owner told CNBC, who asked not to be identified for fear of a backlash. "All of our suppliers are almost sold out of items across the board."\n\nThe person added that he expects gun sales in his establishment to see a jump of anywhere between 200 and 400 percent. "At a minimum we\'ll double our sales from last year," he added.\n\nA representative for Colorado\'s Bureau of Investigation\'s (CBI) InstaCheck Unit told CNBC that firearms background check requests was in the throes of "record setting volume." The day following the Sandy Hook shooting the CBI received a one-day total of 4,154 requests — a new historical peak.\n\nAlthough numbers for Monday weren\'t readily available, Susan Medina, a CBI spokesperson, said that the day\'s numbers of submitted background checks "continued to be elevated," creating a sizable backlog that the organization is struggling to keep pace with.\n\nThe CBI "is working extremely hard to clear the previous day\'s queue to then launching to the current day\'s checks," Medina told CNBC in an emailed statement.\n\nThe National Instant Criminal Background Check System run by the Federal Bureau of Investigation – which oversees the impromptu investigations required for gun buyers – also saw similar volume to InstaCheck, the CBI stated.\n\nAccording to NCIS data, almost 17 million firearms related background checks have been run this year as of Nov. 30.\n\nParadoxically, gun maker stocks have taken it on the chin since the news on Sandy Hook broke.

Sturm Ruger & Company\'s shares also plunged by nearly eight percent, after shedding about nine percent of its value since the shooting.\n\nBoth companies were hurt in part by news that private equity giant Cerberus Capital Management would immediately shed its stake in gun maker Freedom Group, citing the Connecticut tragedy.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Barack Obama is scheduled to hold a press conference as part of an administration wide initiative to curb gun violence, the outgrowth of which may be new legislation.

The point was to differentiate claims that were debatable from those that weren’t.\n\nSo in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary school massacre in Newtown, Conn., let’s try a little example. How would you classify these statements?\n\n1. Americans should have unlimited freedom to purchase and own firearms.\n\n2. For most of our history, Americans had unlimited freedom to purchase and own firearms.\n\nStatement No. 1 is a matter of opinion, of course, on which Americans differ sharply. Although 44 states have passed a law since 1980 giving citizens the right to carry concealed weapons outside of their homes, a 2004 Gallup poll, for example, showed that 44 percent of Americans believed that only law enforcement officials should have such a right. Another 26 percent said that “only those who have a clear need for a weapon” (such as people who transport large amounts of cash) should be able to carry one, and another 27 percent said “any private citizen” should be allowed to do so.\n\nBut Statement No. 2 is clearly a “fact question,” as we used to say, not an opinion one. Either Americans possessed broad gun rights for most of our history, or they didn’t. True or false?\n\nIt’s false. Indeed, the truth is precisely the opposite: Until the very recent past, individual gun rights were severely restricted. Believe it or not, the entire concept of “gun rights” – that is, of citizens’ unbridled freedom to buy and own firearms – is largely a creation of our own times.\n\nYes, the Second Amendment to the Constitution guarantees the “right to bear arms.” But if that means individual citizens – as opposed to state militias – can carry firearms anywhere they want, someone forgot to tell our 19th-century forebears. As law professor Adam Winkler has found, 10 states passed laws in the 1800s barring the possession of concealed weapons.\n\nOne of them was Texas, the lodestar of the gun-rights movement today. But as the Lone Star governor said in 1893, “the mission of the concealed weapon is murder. To check it is the duty of every self-respecting, law abiding man.”\n\nFounded in 1871 as a hunting organization, the National Rifle Association supported waiting periods for handgun buyers and a wide array of other state restrictions. It also backed the first major federal gun regulation, the 1934 National Firearms Act, which was upheld by the Supreme Court in a unanimous decision five years later.\n\nAs US Solicitor General Robert Jackson told the Court, the Second Amendment did not protect the right of individuals to possess guns for “private purposes.” Instead, it was “restricted to the keeping and bearing of arms by the people collectively for their common defense and security,” wrote Jackson, who would join the Court himself in 1941.\n\nOnly in the 1970s would the NRA and conservatives start to argue that the Second Amendment guaranteed individual gun possession. Piggybacking cleverly on the minority and women’s rights revolutions, the NRA claimed that gun owners, too, were endowed with “rights” that were protected by the Constitution.\n\nThe group also created a giant lobbying and publicity apparatus to spread this new doctrine. Reflecting on the NRA's politicking, Chief Justice Warren Burger said that the Second Amendment “has been the subject of one of the greatest pieces of fraud – I repeat the word ‘fraud’ – on the American public by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime.”\n\nBut Burger had retired by the time he made that statement, and the NRA was on the rise. Today, millions of Americans take it for granted that the Constitution protects individual gun rights. So do their legislatures and courts, which have discovered a meaning in the Second Amendment that earlier generations never imagined.\n\nThat’s doesn’t mean they’re wrong, necessarily, or that prior interpretations were right. Our past is replete with legal doctrines that have shifted with the times, in ways that we justly celebrate. For nearly two centuries, most notoriously, courts upheld the enslavement, segregation, and disenfranchisement of African-Americans.\n\nBut no honest person could possibly maintain that blacks possessed equal rights throughout these years. And that’s exactly the kind of thing we hear routinely about gun rights from the NRA and others who want you to believe that these “freedoms” were deeply inscribed in American life before the big, bad liberal state took them away.\n\nAmericans can debate whether they should be able to own guns, and under what conditions. They can even argue that the country would be better off with more guns, rather than fewer.\n\nBut one cannot say that our foreparents intended to give everyone the right to own a gun and carry it wherever they wished. That’s a fraud, to borrow Justice Burger’s phrase. I repeat the word: fraud. Saying it over and over again won’t make it true.\n\nJonathan Zimmerman is a professor of history and education at New York University.

They corralled their wards into cupboards, toilets and storage areas, telling them all was fine while privately praying that the awful clatter-clatter outside would stop. Doors were jammed shut with furniture, boys told to stand on toilets to make room.\n\nThe noise did finally end – it had sounded like cans falling on the floor Richie Wilford, seven, later told his father – and suddenly, like a blessing, it was police officers who were running through the elementary school here in Sandy Hook telling everyone to move out. Walk "very quickly" outside and to the fire station next door, they instructed.\n\nThe teachers still tried to smile. Maybe it was a drill, they said. Yet for some, escaping the school meant passing by the two classrooms where moments before a lone gunman, now known to be 20-year-old Adam Lanza and thought to have been a pupil here, had perpetrated the horror this nation is today struggling to comprehend. Close your eyes, the children were told, as they walked crocodile-fashion, hands on each other\'s shoulders, through a freshly made hell.\n\nParents, alerted by the emergency notification system, were by now streaming towards the school, tucked away in a wooded clearing above Sandy Hook, a division of the larger, mostly prosperous of township of Newtown, a classically pretty southern New England community set in slow-rising hills traced with Connecticut stone walls. The cliché of these tragedies – how could it have happened here? – is more apt than ever in a setting like this.\n\nSomething else we also say is "unimaginable", but we try to put ourselves in their shoes anyway. My daughter, one year younger than the shooter, went to a woodsy elementary school in this same Connecticut county, and I can\'t stop thinking about its lobby and her classroom, the paper dragons strung from the ceiling. What would go through your mind as traffic stopped you from getting there faster when you learnt a madman had paid a visit?\n\n"There\'s no words," said Richard Wilford, describing rushing to the fire station to see if Richie was dead, injured or unscathed. "It\'s sheer terror, a sense of imminent danger, to get to your child and be there to protect him." Laura Phelps, another parent who has two children at the school aged six and nine, described the experience this way yesterday: "It was like reaching into your insides and pulling them out." Both survived, but the younger one lost friends.\n\nIt was chaotic at the fire station. Most parents found their loved ones. By then they knew that a gunman had opened fire in the school and there was word that the school\'s principal, Dawn Hochsprung, had died. Most left unaware of the enormity of what had happened – that 20 little ones, in two classes, had been gunned down, and six adults. The worst school shooting, putting aside the Virginia Tech massacre of 2007 that killed 32, the US has ever seen. They didn\'t know the gunman was dead, that earlier he had shot his mother at home.\n\nEven library assistant Mary Ann Jacob was still uncertain at that time. She was in the small library when the first gunshots rang out. She hurried a group of children into a back storage room where she gave them pieces of paper and crayons to colour while their classmates were falling to whizzing bullets just two walls away. "The kids cosied up, and we waited," she told reporters yesterday. "When the police finally came, we were afraid to open the door."\n\nWhen Ms Jacob got everyone to the fire station, she saw that staff members were already holding up placards to assemble each class into separate areas so roll calls could be taken. That is when the bottom fell from her stomach. It was clear to her that two classes were simply missing. Something truly dreadful had happened, even though most of the rest of the world didn\'t know it yet. The first to learn were those parents who weren\'t finding their babies.\n\n"Unimaginable" applies to the pain of those parents. It\'s tough even to write about. Long after dark in Sandy Hook, most were still in the fire station receiving counselling and waiting to see the bodies of their lost ones, which still then lay in the school which remained a crime scene. Barricaded off at some distance, reporters could only wonder – when has so much agony been assembled under one single roof? And right there is another cliché – there is nothing worse in life than losing your own child. Here, in tiny, charming Sandy Hook, with its burbling brook, 20 were dead. By yesterday morning, officials said, the bodies had been removed from the school and taken to Newtown morgue.\n\nAnd then there is the shooter, Lanza, dead at the scene seemingly by a self-inflicted wound. How do you fathom him? Just 20 years old, he was nerdy, skinny and a high achiever at school. He was a loner, who was remembered by some for enjoying a school tech club and computer games. His brother, Ryan Lanza, 24, who for a few hours was incorrectly identified by the media as the gunman, told investigators that he thought his brother suffered from a personality disorder. What could possibly drive someone to do this? To little children? Even President Obama had moisture in his eyes expressing his grief to the nation, and no wonder, because he is a father.\n\nDr H Wayne Carver, the chief medical examiner, said last night: "This is probably the worst I\'ve seen and the worst that any of my colleagues have seen. This is a very devastating set of injuries." He confirmed all those who had died had been shot more than once with a rifle. Facial photographs of the victims were shown to their parents.\n\nLt Paul Vance, of the Connecticut state patrol, indicated last night that investigators had gleaned what he said was "very good evidence" about Lanza, we assume mostly at the home at 34 Yogananda Street that he had shared with his mother since his parents broke up and divorced a few years ago. This is not a down-at-heel section of Newtown. This and other adjacent streets still blazed on Friday night with Christmas lights and illuminated reindeers adorning the front lawns of million-dollar mini-mansions. No one, though, wanted to talk about the Lanza family or admit even to knowing them.\n\nIf there was a note left by the gunman we don\'t yet know about it. Investigators fanned out yesterday to local gun clubs to see if Lanza had enrolled at any, perhaps to train for his massacre. A Glock and a Sig Sauer, both pistols, and a .223-calibre Bushmaster rifle were found in the school and a fourth weapon outside the school.\n\nWe do know something about the timeline of his butchery. It seems – though not all the details are confirmed – he killed his mother early and, dressed in black trousers and a military vest, then stowed the weapons in her car and drove it to the school, about five miles away, where he forced his way in. He chose two classrooms and shot victims clinically. Take note that when all the victims were down there was only one injured person.\n\nMs Hochsprung was in her office with the school psychologist, Mary Sherlach, when it started. They ran to investigate and into the deadly blizzard of Lanza\'s bullets. Before leaving, Ms Hochsprung had flipped on the loudspeaker system at her desk so all the teachers would know a shooting was under way and to shelter the children.\n\nBy dusk, starry and cold, no one in Newtown was unaware any more. Their town is in the history books for the worst of reasons. Some residents drove to their respective churches to pray and feel a sense of togetherness. Brad Tefft, a warden at the Newtown United Methodist Church in Sandy Hook, had opened the doors even earlier for anyone who wanted to come by and just sit. "I am fairly numb right now," he said. "I still can\'t fathom it, that this would happen in a town like this. We are not New York City. This is a caring town that is all about our children."\n\nMary Ann Napier is a consultant who also runs a small summertime ice-cream parlour in an old clapboard house called Heaven a quarter of a mile from the school. Her eyes are red with crying when she and some friends gather at dusk for a moment of prayer in the small front room behind the shop where 26 small candles burn in the hearth, one for each victim. Making things more difficult was still not knowing which of her neighbours had lost children. Or, if you like, which of her happy, jabbering customers from August were gone. "I just don\'t know which one of them will not be coming in next year," she said, almost gasping under the emotional weight.\n\nMr Tefft says Christmas is more important now than ever. And Newtown, meanwhile, has its heroes to celebrate, who also include kindergarten teacher Kaitlin Roig who took her 14 pupils into a lavatory (and, yes, asked one boy to make room by standing on the toilet). "If they started crying, I would take their face and tell them, \'It\'s going to be OK.\' I wanted that to be the last thing they heard, not the gunfire in the hall," she said of her ordeal.\n\nBy nightfall on Friday, Ms Roig was struggling to keep it together, her father Pat admitted in a phone conversation. "She is totally shocked. She is very emotional and we are hoping she will calm down." But his pride was clear. "She did what she had to do."

As President Obama said in his speech the night of the tragedy with tears in his eyes and his face twitching: "As a country, we have been through this too many times. Whether it\'s an elementary school in Newtown, or a shopping mall in Oregon, or a temple in Wisconsin, or a movie theater in Aurora, or a street corner in Chicago -- these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods, and these children are our children." And then with a resolute look, Obama declared: "And we\'re going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics."\n\nUnfortunately, the many shocking mass shootings this year brought to the fore other declarations of intent to tackle the out-of-control gun culture epidemic, but no meaningful action. After the shooting of Arizona Representative Gabrielle Giffords last year, Obama promised "sound and effective steps that will actually keep those irresponsible, law-breaking few from getting their hands on a gun in the first place." However, no resolution so far emerged, although a more intensive background check on individuals purchasing firearms was promised by the Justice Department. Likewise, while Obama cited the need for stricter gun laws earlier this year after the Aurora, Colo. movie theater shooting earlier this year, no action has yet been taken on the federal level to promote gun control so far. Moreover, under the Obama Administration, laws around the country have become more lax, allowing people to carry concealed weapons, and there are more places where people are allowed to openly carry guns, while weapon sales have boomed.\n\nCould it be different this time? The election is over and Obama and his administration have four years to carry out meaningful gun control legislation. During the 2012 election Republicans were widely defeated, and, in particular, extreme conservatives were defeated in race after race. Clearly, the public is fed up with conservative Republicans\' politics, like their insistent opposition to any gun control measures, and may be ready for "change that matters" in gun laws.\n\nPerhaps President Obama\'s emotional speech at a Sandy Hook Memorial service on Sunday, Dec. 16 could mark a turning point in the national attitude toward gun control. In a heartfelt speech full of biblical references and resonances, Obama insisted that we must do something and take up the challenges of mass shootings.\n\nIndeed, in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook slaughter, throughout the media and public sphere there have been calls to return to the ban on assault rifles carried out by the Clinton administration in 1994 and which expired during the Bush/Cheney Administration in 2004. The shooters at both the Oregon Mall and Sandy Hill Elementary School carried AR-15 rifles and high-speed gun magazines allowing hundreds of high-velocity bullets to be fired rapidly. In the light of such awesome and destructive firepower, surely a consensus could be constructed that there is no rational reason to let private citizens run amok with deadly assault weapons, such as the rapid-fire guns that were used in both Oregon and Connecticut to kill innocents in a mall and public school.\n\nLikewise, there are multiple calls for more intensive background checks and even gun registration which would surely limit gun ownership among criminals and people with mental health problems. While there are serious mental health issues involved in the epidemic of mass shootings in the U.S., it is definitely a mistake to reduce the problem to mental health since all of the mass shootings this year have involved males deeply immersed in gun culture who used guns to perpetrate mass murderers. Until we understand the depth of the problem of an out-of-control gun culture and take rational steps to control it, we are condemned to repeat endlessly the cycle of the murder of innocents.\n\nFinally, it will be a mistake to wait and expect politicians on the national level to solve this problem of mass shootings and the need for gun control. This is an issue that concerns every individual who cares about their fellow citizens and wants to see a reduction in gun violence. We need a national discussion to pressure politicians on the national, state, and local level to move toward seeing the extent of the problem of gun violence, and the need for serious steps to address the cycle of mass shootings. Otherwise the epidemic of mass killings will become worse and there will no nowhere safe from gun violence.', 'title': 'The Sandy Hook Slaughter: Turning Point for Gun Control?', 'url': 'https://www.huffingtonpost.com/douglas-kellner/the-sandy-hook-slaughter_b_2332744.html', 'keywords': ['sandy', 'violence', 'steps', 'turning', 'obama', 'problem', 'mass', 'gun', 'shootings', 'need', 'slaughter', 'hook', 'control', 'point'], 'tags': {"What's Working: Purpose + Profit", 'HuffPost Press Room', 'Shooting', 'Social Justice', 'Relationships', 'Podcasts', 'Impact: This New World', 'Donald Trump', '2018 Elections', 'Bill Clinton', 'Difference Maker 100', 'The Power of Humanity', 'Outspeak', 'Extremism', 'Mental Health', 'Congress', 'Finds', 'Sleep & Wellness', 'Asian Voices', 'Impact: Project Zero', 'Gun Violence', 'Sandy Hook Elementary School Shooting'}, 'summary': 'The election is over and Obama and his administration have four years to carry out meaningful gun control legislation.\nClearly, the public is fed up with conservative Republicans\' politics, like their insistent opposition to any gun control measures, and may be ready for "change that matters" in gun laws.\nPerhaps President Obama\'s emotional speech at a Sandy Hook Memorial service on Sunday, Dec. 16 could mark a turning point in the national attitude toward gun control.\nThis is an issue that concerns every individual who cares about their fellow citizens and wants to see a reduction in gun violence.\nOtherwise the epidemic of mass killings will become worse and there will no nowhere safe from gun violence.', 'date': 1356013786}, {'text': 'By clicking “Agree,” you consent to Slate’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy and the use of technologies such as cookies by Slate and our partners to deliver relevant advertising on our site, in emails and across the Internet, to personalize content and perform site analytics.

President Obama, who has seen by his count four large-scale shootings in his first term as president, suggested that his administration would take action towards more gun control. In his speech at a vigil in Newtown, he asked, "Are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of our freedom?"\n\nA number of lawmakers, including previously strong advocates for gun rights, have also said it is time for the nation to take a look at its gun control laws. Among the proposals being put forth is a ban on assault weapons and the elimination of the so-called "gun show loophole" that allows for those not "engaged in the business" of selling firearms to privately sell guns without the background checks and paperwork required for licensed vendors.\n\nAdvocates of tougher firearm regulation point out that the United States has a higher rate of gun deaths than many other developed countries including Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. They argue that even if the proposals being offered wouldn\'t have prevented the Sandy Hook shooting, they would at least put a dent in the some tens of thousands of gun deaths America experiences each year (over 31,000 in 2007, the year for which the most recent data is available from the Centers for Disease Control).\n\nDefenders of gun rights say that any more regulations would violate the Second Amendment, which says, "A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringe." Many argue that if more citizens carried weapons, criminals would be less likely to commit violent crimes. Some also suggest that other issues aside from guns should be the forefront of the national debate in the wake of the tragedy, including violence in video games and access the mental healthcare in America. (The Newtown shooter reportedly was a video gamer and suffered from a mental illness).\n\nDoes the Sandy Hook shooting prove the need for more gun control?

In an especially emotional moment during a prayer vigil, Barack Obama read out the first names of the 20 children killed during the December 14th school shooting in Sandy Hook, Connecticut. The children were all six or seven years old. Six adults at the school were also killed, including the principal, who died trying to save her charges.\n\nThe carnage has rocked the community of Sandy Hook, part of the town of Newtown. Makeshift memorials made of candles, flowers and fluffy toys have sprung up all over the hilly New England village. Townspeople and visitors make pilgrimages to the school. They share tales of heroic teachers and brave children. One little boy offered to lead the evacuation as “I know karate.” Churches are open round the clock. Six-year-old Olivia Engel was supposed to be an angel in a nativity scene. Now, said Monsignor Bob Weiss, she is an angel in heaven.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shooting has shocked a country long accustomed to gun violence. There have been a dozen mass-shootings this year. Over the summer murderous gun rampages occurred at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin and at a cinema in Colorado. Mr Obama’s visit to Sandy Hook was the fourth time he has been to a community devastated in this way. Fighting tears, an unusually emotional Mr Obama said in an address to the nation that action is needed, “regardless of the politics”.\n\nOther gun-related incidents, such as the one in 2011 which left Gabrielle Giffords, an Arizona congresswoman, severely injured and killed six others, did nothing to push politicians to fight for gun control. But this time does seem different. Since the shooting more than 180,000 Americans have petitioned the White House to introduce gun-control legislation. Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Mark Warner of Virginia, both given A ratings the National Rifle Association, are now calling for gun control. But the reformers have a huge task ahead of them. According to one survey, roughly a third of all American households own firearms. Three-quarters of those own more than one. Around 300m guns are in circulation, about one for every person in the country.\n\nBetween 1994 and 2004 the federal assault-weapons ban outlawed certain weapons. Since its expiry most of the debate about new gun-control legislation has not focused on banning guns, but about allowing them in more places—in national parks, on trains, in churches and at colleges. Still, Dianne Feinstein, a Democratic senator from California, plans speedily to reintroduce an updated federal ban on these weapons. And Mr Obama’s spokesman has indicated that he will support it.\n\nAny serious new gun-control laws are likely to face opposition from the NRA. The lobby group has bragged that it defeated 19 of the 24 congressmen it targeted in 1994, shortly after the assault ban went into effect. The NRA kept a low profile this week, though it promised a statement on December 21st which would make “meaningful contributions” towards gun safety. Others have acted already: California’s legislature moved to require a licence for anyone buying ammunition, and Cerberus Capital, a private-equity group, said it will sell its stake in the firm that made the semi-automatic rifle used in Sandy Hook.\n\nMichael Bloomberg, New York’s anti-gun mayor, this week urged Mr Obama to introduce legislation. If the president does nothing, Mr Bloomberg notes that some 48,000 Americans will be murdered by guns during his second term—several times more Americans than died on September 11th 2001, in Afghanistan and Iraq combined. Tightening existing laws would be a start. The 1994 Brady bill, named after Ronald Reagan’s press spokesman who was critically injured in an assassination attempt, brought in federal background checks for gun purchases. The refusal rate is very low, just 0.6% of the 157m checks processed. Besides, 40% of firearms purchases are not from licensed gun-dealers or are at gun shows, and do not require even this background check. That is one change that may well now be made.\n\nMarco Rubio, a Republican senator from Florida, has called for a study on how to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill. This distracts from the main issue of gun control, but it is true that gunmen in recent mass-shootings have indeed been mentally ill. A federal law is already on the books to prevent dangerous mentally-ill people from buying guns. Not all such people are included in national background-check databases, however. The Virginia Tech shooter, who killed 32 people, had recorded problems of that sort which his state did not send to the federal database.\n\nAdam Lanza, the 20-year old gunman at Sandy Hook, did not submit himself to a background check. His mother legally bought and owned the Bushmaster and the two other guns that he carried. She was his first victim. He shot her in the face numerous times and took her weapons before he went to the school.\n\nMr Obama has said he will act within weeks. He should follow the example of America’s friends. In 1996 a massacre in a Scottish school in Dunblane killed 16 children and one teacher. The next year the private ownership of most handguns was banned in Britain. Also that year John Howard, Australia’s conservative prime minister, ushered in a semi-automatic-weapon ban a fortnight after 35 were killed in a gun massacre in Tasmania. If similar laws had been in effect in Sandy Hook, some of those lost might have survived.

Mr. Lanza is killed or incapacitated, and a massacre is averted.\n\nThis scenario is what some Texas state legislators and pro-gun advocates nationally are arguing for in the wake of the tragedy. Instead of trying to get rid of guns to prevent school violence, they want to allow teachers and administrators who are trained and licensed to carry weapons in the classroom.\n\nA host of Texas legislators say they will introduce legislation to allow gun-toting teachers in the Lone Star State. US Rep. Louie Gohmert (R) of Texas told Chris Wallace on Fox News last Sunday he wished the principal at the Sandy Hook Elementary School had a weapon.\n\n"Chris, I wish to God she had had an M-4 in her office, locked up so when she heard gunfire, she pulls it out ... and takes him out and takes his head off before he can kill those precious kids."\n\nA bill to allow guns in schools passed the Michigan Legislature the day of the Sandy Hook shooting, but was vetoed by the governor; Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell says it ought to be discussed; and conservative commentator Bill Bennett, a former Education secretary, talking about the idea on “Meet the Press” last weekend, said, “But, my God, if you can prevent this kind of thing, I think – I think – I think we ought to.”\n\nThe issue has sparked a hot debate. Those in favor say allowing teachers to arm themselves gives them a fighting chance. They argue that police can’t watch all the entrances to schools, so another tragedy is just a matter of time.\n\nThose opposed say it sends the wrong message to the students – that getting into a gun fight is the way to resolve the issue. In addition, children might get hurt in any gun battle. And, they ask, what happens when police arrive on the scene and see someone in the classroom holding a gun? The police won’t know if it’s a teacher or an intruder and will just shoot, possibly killing the teacher.\n\n“I’ve been involved with education my whole life, and I can’t imagine any circumstances where it can be done in a safe and reasonable way,” says Dr. Robert Villanova, director of the executive leadership program at the Neag School of Education at the University of Connecticut in Storrs. “It’s hard enough to get teachers to lock their doors.”\n\nDr. Joseph Cirasuolo, executive director of the Connecticut Association of School Superintendents, worries that guns in the classroom could lead to unfortunate accidents.\n\n“There is a risk the teacher sees a student and thinks the student has a gun,” says Dr. Cirasuolo, who has been involved with education since 1964. “The teacher shoots the student, and it turns out it’s not a gun.”\n\nCirasuolo, formerly the CEO of the American Association of School Administrators, thinks that over 90 percent of his colleagues in education would prefer not to be armed. “I know people who are hunters, and they would not think of teachers as carrying weapons around the school.”\n\nAlready 47 states and Washington, D.C., generally outlaw guns at K-12 schools, in safe-school zones, or on school-related transportation, except by law enforcement officials, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence in San Francisco.\n\nThe federal government, as part of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002, outlawed firearms carried by students. A state risks losing its federal funds if it violates the prohibition.\n\nOpinion in Newtown’s small village of Sandy Hook, where the shooting took place, is mixed.\n\nSitting outside of the Demitasse Café, three college juniors are selling homemade Christmas ornaments to raise money for mental health counseling for those affected by the tragedy. All three say they are opposed to arming school staff.\n\nOne, Olivia, from the University of Connecticut, says she “absolutely” is against the idea. “That wouldn’t solve any problem.”\n\nHowever, as she pays her respects at a memorial wall of stuffed animals and candles, Sarah Rose of Bristol, Conn., says she thinks it’s a good idea.\n\n“If a teacher who is licensed and trained wants to carry a concealed weapon, I don’t see why that is a problem,” says Ms. Rose. “But, I don’t know what the answer is to fixing our system.”\n\nAttempts to allow weapons in principals’ offices or anywhere else in schools meet with howls of protest from teachers unions. They maintain that the answer is to spend more money on mental-health screening so dangerous individuals can be kept away from guns.\n\nGayle Fallon, president of the Houston Federation of Teachers, notes that the majority of teachers are female, and that they might carry the gun in their purse, where it can be stolen.\n\n“When you put your purse down, the chance of someone grabbing a weapon increases,” says Ms. Fallon, who is licensed to carry a gun herself.\n\nShe also worries that a police officer arriving at a classroom where there has been an incident won’t be able to differentiate between the perpetrator and the teacher.\n\n“I have talked to the police, and they tell me that if they see someone with a gun and the person looks at them they will shoot them,” Fallon says. “It increases the risk to the teacher and that’s not a good idea.”\n\nFormer teacher Charles Russo, now a law professor at the University of Dayton, thinks giving a weapon to teachers could make a bad situation worse. “I have never used a gun, and I’m not sure I could hit a wall,” he says.\n\nHe says he saw a recent advertisement for bullet-proof backpacks for children. “What’s next?” he asks.\n\nProfessor Russo says the uproar over the Sandy Hook shootings is obscuring the fact that schools are actually very safe.\n\nAccording to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, less than 1 percent of all homicides or suicides among school-age children occur on school grounds, going to or from school, or on the way to or from school-sponsored events.\n\nHowever, Steve Siebold, an author and commentator, thinks allowing teachers to pack a gun is the only way to level the playing field against people who want to kill innocent people. “It gives them a fighting chance,” says Mr. Siebold, author of “Sex, Politics and Religion: How Delusional Thinking is Destroying America.” “The government can’t protect our kids, and banning guns is delusional,” he says. “If there is a better answer, I’d like to hear it.”\n\nCirasuolo, of the school superintendents association, believes it will take a “multifaceted” approach that includes better use of technology, such as video cameras, limits on automatic assault weapons, and increases in services to the mentally ill.\n\nCiracuolo, who has been working with the Newtown school system since the incident, thinks society also needs to look more closely at the violence in electronic media.\n\nFollow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.\n\n“When we see movies about wars they are always glorious,” he says.

The highly-anticipated press conference came one week after the tragedy in Newtown, Conn. last week.\n\nCEO Wayne LaPierre blamed many things in his press conference for the influx of mass shootings in the U.S. — everything from gun-free school zones, the media, movies, violent video games, hurricanes, and a lack of government funding.\n\n"The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun," LaPierre said.\n\nAt the same time, he deflected any criticism the organization has taken over the past week, saying the organization "remained respectfully silent." He was interrupted by two separate protestors at the event, after which the NRA did not take questions.\n\nLaPierre said that the NRA is calling on Congress to put armed security guards in every school. The NRA has set up a website to advance the cause.\n\n"The only way — the only way — to stop a monster from killing our kids is to be personally involved and invested in a plan for protection," LaPierre said. He added that gun-free zones "tells every killer that schools are the safest place" to go and carry out mass shootings.\n\nLaPierre questioned what would have happened if there were armed security at the school:\n\n"What if, when Adam Lanza started shooting his way into Sandy Hook Elementary School, he was confronted by qualified armed security? ... 26 innocent lives might have been spared that day," he said.\n\nLaPierre also blamed lack of government funding.\n\n"With all the foreign aid … with all the money in federal budget … can\'t we afford to put a police officer in every school?"\n\nA lesser part of his speech placed blame on a media culture that he suggested promoted violence. He took aim at celebrities, video games, and movies for advancing that culture.\n\n"Another little dirty secret the media tries to conceal," LaPierre says, is "a callous corrupt and disgusting shadow industry ... vicious violent video games." He then called violent films "the filthiest form of pornography."\n\n"Then there\'s the blood-soaked slasher films like \'American Psycho\' and \'Natural Born Killers\' that are aired like propaganda loops on \'Splatterdays\' and every day," he said, "and a thousand music videos that portray life as a joke and murder as a way of life."\n\nHere\'s a photo of the first protester that interrupted LaPierre.

While some have tried to exploit tragedy for political gain, we have remained respectfully silent. Now, we must speak … for the safety of our nation\'s children.\n\nBecause for all the noise and anger directed at us over the past week, no one— nobody — has addressed the most important, pressing and immediate question we face: How do we protect our children right now , starting today, in a way that we know works? The only way to answer that question is to face up to the truth.\n\nPoliticians pass laws for Gun-Free School Zones. They issue press releases bragging about them. They post signs advertising them. And in so doing, they tell every insane killer in America that schools are their safest place to inflict maximum mayhem with minimum risk.\n\nHow have our nation\'s priorities gotten so far out of order? Think about it. We care about our money, so we protect our banks with armed guards. American airports, office buildings, power plants,courthouses — even sports stadiums — are all protected by armed security. We care about the President, so we protect him with armed Secret Service agents. Members of Congress work in offices surrounded by armed Capitol Police officers. Yet when it comes to the most beloved, innocent and vulnerable members of the American family — our children — we as a society leave them utterly defenseless, and the monsters and predators of this world know it and exploit it.\n\nThat must change now! The truth is that our society is populated by an unknown number of genuine monsters — people so deranged, so evil, so possessed by voices and driven by demons that no sane person can possibly\n\never comprehend them. They walk among us every day. And does anybody really believe that the next Adam Lanza isn\'t planning his attack on aschool he\'s already identified at this very moment? How many more copycats are waiting in the wings for their moment of fame — from a national media machine that rewards them with the wall-to-wall attention and sense of identity that they crave — while provoking others to try to make their mark? A dozen more killers? A hundred? More? How can we possibly even guess how many, given our nation\'s refusal to create an active national database of the mentally ill?\n\nAnd the fact is, that wouldn\'t even begin to address the much larger and more lethal criminal class: Killers, robbers, rapists and drug gang members who have spread like cancer in every community in this country. Meanwhile, federal gun prosecutions have decreased by 40%— to the lowest levels in a decade. So now, due to a declining willingness to prosecute dangerous criminals, violent crime is increasing again for the first time in19 years! Add another hurricane, terrorist attack or some other natural or man-made disaster, and you\'ve got a recipe for a national nightmare of violence and victimization.\n\nAnd here\'s another dirty little truth that the media try their best to conceal: There exists in this country a callous, corrupt and corrupting shadow industry that sells, and sows, violence against its own people. Through vicious, violent video games with names like Bulletstorm,Grand Theft Auto, Mortal Kombat and Splatterhouse. And here’s one:it’s called Kindergarten Killers. It’s been online for 10 years. How come my research department could find it and all of yours either couldn’t or didn’t want anyone to know you had found it?\n\nThen there’s the blood-soaked slasher films like "American Psycho"and "Natural Born Killers" that are aired like propaganda loops on"Splatterdays" and every day, and a thousand music videos thatportray life as a joke and murder as a way of life. And then they havethe nerve to call it "entertainment." But is that what it really is? Isn\'t fantasizing about killing people as away to get your kicks really the filthiest form of pornography?\n\nIn a race to the bottom, media conglomerates compete with one another to shock, violate and offend every standard of civilized society by bringing an ever-more-toxic mix of reckless behavior and criminal cruelty into our homes — every minute of every day of every month of every year.\n\nA child growing up in America witnesses 16,000 murders and 200,000acts of violence by the time he or she reaches the ripe old age of 18. And throughout it all, too many in our national media … their corporate owners … and their stockholders … act as silent enablers, if not complicit co-conspirators. Rather than face their own moral failings,the media demonize lawful gun owners, amplify their cries for more laws and fill the national debate with misinformation and dishonest thinking that only delay meaningful action and all but guarantee that the next atrocity is only a news cycle away.\n\n\n\nThe media call semi-automatic firearms "machine guns" — they claim these civilian semi-automatic firearms are used by the military, and they tell us that the .223 round is one of the most powerful rifle calibers ... when all of these claims are factually untrue. They don\'t know what they\'re talking about! Worse, they perpetuate the dangerous notion that one more gun ban — or one more law imposed on peaceful, lawful people — will protect us where 20,000 others have failed!\n\nAs brave, heroic and self-sacrificing as those teachers were in those classrooms, and as prompt, professional and well-trained as those police were when they responded, they were unable — through no fault of their own — to stop it. As parents, we do everything we can to keep our children safe. It is now time for us to assume responsibility for their safety at school. The only way to stop a monster from killing our kids is to be personally involved and invested in a plan of absolute protection. The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. Would you rather have your 911 call bring a good guy with a gun from a mile away ... or a minute away?\n\nNow, I can imagine the shocking headlines you\'ll print tomorrow morning: "More guns," you\'ll claim, "are the NRA\'s answer to everything!" Your implication will be that guns are evil and have no place in society, much less in our schools. But since when did the word "gun" automatically become a bad word? A gun in the hands of a Secret Service agent protecting the President isn\'t a bad word. A gun in the hands of a soldier protecting the United States isn\'t a bad word. And when you hear the glass breaking in your living room at 3 a.m. and call 911, you won\'t be able to pray hard enough for a gun in the hands of a good guy to get there fast enough o protect you.\n\nSo why is the idea of a gun good when it\'s used to protect our President or our country or our police, but\n\nbad when it\'s used to protect our children in their schools?They\'re our kids. They\'re our responsibility. And it\'s not just our duty to protect them — it\'s our right to protect them.\n\nYou know, five years ago, after the Virginia Tech tragedy, when I said we should put armed security in every school, the media called me crazy. But what if, when Adam Lanza started shooting his way into Sandy Hook Elementary School last Friday, he had been confronted by qualified, armed security? Will you at least admit it\'s possible\n\nthat 26 innocent lives might have been spared? Is that so abhorrent to you that you would rather continue to risk the alternative?Is the press and political class here in Washington so consumed by fear and hatred of the NRA and America’s gun owners that you\'re willing to accept a world where real resistance to evil monsters is a lone, unarmed school principal left to surrender her life to shield the children in her care? No one — regardless of personal political prejudice — has the right to impose that sacrifice.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, there is no national, one-size-fits-all solution to protecting our children. But do know this President zeroed out school emergency planning grants in last year\'s budget, and scrapped "Secure Our Schools"\n\npolicing grants in next year\'s budget. With all the foreign aid, with all the money in the federal budget,we can’t afford to put a police officer in every school?\n\nEven if they did that, politicians have no business — and no authority — denying us the right, the ability, or the moral imperative to protect ourselves and our loved ones from harm. Now, the National Rifle Association knows that there are millions of qualified active and retired police; active, reserve and retired military;security professionals; certified firefighters and rescue personnel; and an extraordinary corps of patriotic, trained qualified citizens to joinwith local school officials and police in devising a protection plan for every school. We can deploy them to protect our kids\n\nnow.\n\nWe can immediately make America\'s schools safer — relying on the brave men and women of America’s police force. The budget of our local police departments are strained and resources are limited, but their dedication and courage are second to none and they can be deployed right now. I call on Congress today to act immediately, to appropriate whatever isnecessary to put armed police officers in every school — and to do it now, to make sure that blanket of safety is in place when our children return to school in January.\n\nBefore Congress reconvenes, before we engage in any lengthy debate over legislation, regulation or anything else, as soon as our kids return to school after the holiday break, we need to have every single school in America\n\nimmediately deploy a protection program proven to work —and by that I mean armed security. Right now, today, every school in the United States should plan meetings with parents, school administrators, teachers and local authorities — and draw upon every resource available — to erect a cordon of protection around our kids right now. Every school will havea different solution based on its own unique situation. Every school in America needs to immediately identify, dedicate and deploy the resources necessary to put these security forces in place right now. And the National Rifle Association, as America\'s preeminent trainer of law enforcement and security personnel for the past 50 years, is ready, willing and uniquely qualified to help.\n\nOur training programs are the most advanced in the world. That expertise must be brought to bear to protect our schools and our children now. We did it for the nation\'s defense industries and military installations during World War II, and we\'ll do it for our schools today. The NRA is going to bring all of its knowledge, dedication and resources to develop a model National School Shield Emergency Response Program for every school that wants it. From armed security to building design and access control to information technology to student and teacher training, this multi-faceted program will be developed by the very best experts in their fields.\n\nFormer Congressman Asa Hutchinson will lead this effort as National Director of the National School Shield Program, with a budget provided by the NRA of whatever scope the task requires. His experience as a U.S. Attorney, Director of the Drug Enforcement Agency and Undersecretary of the Department of Homeland Security will give him the knowledge and expertise to hire the most knowledgeable and credentialed experts available anywhere, to get this program up and running from the first day forward. If we truly cherish our kids more than our money or our celebrities, we must give them the greatest level of protection possible and the security that is only available with a\n\nproperly trained — armed — good guy.\n\nUnder Asa’s leadership, our team of security experts will make this the best program in the world for protecting our children at school, and we will make that program available to every school in America free of charge. That\'s a plan of action that can, and will, make a real, positive and indisputable difference in the safety of our children —starting right now. There\'ll be time for talk and debate later. This is the time,this is the day for decisive action.\n\nWe can\'t wait for the next unspeakable crime to happen before we act. We can\'t lose precious time debating legislation that won’t work. We mustn\'t allow politics or personal prejudice to divide us. We must act now. For the sake of the safety of every child in America, I call on every parent, every teacher, every school administrator and every law enforcement officer in this country to join us in the National SchoolShield Program and protect our children with the only line of positive defense that\'s tested and proven to work. And now, to tell you more about the program, I\'d like to introducethe head of that effort — a former U.S. congressman, former U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas and former administrator of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the Honorable Asa Hutchinson.\n\n\n\n', 'title': 'NRA condemned after its astonishing response to Sandy Hook massacre calling for schools to arm themselves', 'url': 'http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2251762/NRA-condemned-astonishing-response-Sandy-Hook-massacre-calling-schools-arm-themselves.htmlhttps://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/12/21/after-sandy-hook-should-violent-video-games-call-a-cease-fire/', 'keywords': ['sandy', 'right', 'response', 'condemned', 'astonishing', 'children', 'armed', 'massacre', 'program', 'calling', 'schools', 'gun', 'arm', 'nra', 'security', 'media', 'hook', 'school', 'protect', 'national'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'American airports, office buildings, power plants,courthouses — even sports stadiums — are all protected by armed security.\nAnd throughout it all, too many in our national media … their corporate owners … and their stockholders … act as silent enablers, if not complicit co-conspirators.\nBut what if, when Adam Lanza started shooting his way into Sandy Hook Elementary School last Friday, he had been confronted by qualified, armed security?\nThe NRA is going to bring all of its knowledge, dedication and resources to develop a model National School Shield Emergency Response Program for every school that wants it.\nFormer Congressman Asa Hutchinson will lead this effort as National Director of the National School Shield Program, with a budget provided by the NRA of whatever scope the task requires.', 'date': 1356048000}, {'text': 'In the first post-Sandy Hook press conference held by the The National Rifle Association today, executive vice president Wayne LaPierre tore into some gratuitous and controversial parts of pop culture to explain the spate of mass killings that have occurred this year.\n\n“There exists in this country, sadly, a callous, corrupt and corrupting shadow industry that sells and sows violence against its own people,” LaPierre said during the press conference. “Through vicious violent video games, with names like Bulletstorm, Grand Theft Auto, Mortal Kombat and Splatterhouse.

They're the Sandy Hook family,’ Robinson said after a news conference at a park in Monroe a few miles from the school, which opens for classes on Thursday morning. An open house was held for parents and students on Wednesday.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nKeeping them close: A woman hugs a young boy, who had attended Sandy Hook school, before he boards a bus to a newly set-up school in neighboring Monroe, Connecticut\n\nSchool superintendent Janet Robinson said the decision to re-name the new school as Sandy Hook Elementary School was taken by the teachers from the previous school\n\nRobinson added that renaming the Chalk Hill school will allow staff and students to keep ‘their identity and a comfort level.’\n\n\n\nThe school where the shootings occurred remains closed and guarded by police. Newtown officials haven't decided yet on the building's future.\n\n\n\nIt's been nearly three weeks since the Dec. 14 massacre, when gunman Adam Lanza killed 20 students and six educators. Lanza also killed his mother at the home they shared in Newtown before the school shootings, which ended when Lanza fatally shot himself as police arrived. Police haven't released any details about a motive.\n\nOne parent took the opportunity during Wednesday's open house to thank a teacher for helping protect his son. Vinny Alvarez said the teacher, Courtney Martin, locked her classroom door and kept the children in a corner until it was safe to leave the building.\n\n\n\nNumerous police officers on Wednesday guarded the outside of the Monroe school, which is about seven miles from the old school.\n\n\n\nAsked about the level of security at the new school, Monroe police Lt. Keith White said, ‘I think right now it has to be the safest school in America.’\n\nAnxious: Parents wave goodbye as they see their children on to the bus for school for the first time since the shooting on December 14 in Newtown\n\nSensitive: Sandy Hook students were invited to attend Chalk Hill middle school Wednesday ahead of classes on Thursday. The building has been re-purposed for them as they return to school for the first time since last month's shooting\n\nRobinson said Chalk Hill School has been transformed into a ‘cheerful’ place for the surviving students to resume normal school routines. She said mental health counselors continue to be available for anyone who needs them.\n\n\n\n‘They're so excited to see the teachers,’ Robinson said about the open house attendees.\n\n\n\nSeveral signs welcoming the Sandy Hook students to their new school were posted along the road leading to the school in a rural, mostly residential neighborhood. One said ‘Welcome Sandy Hook Elementary Kids,’ while a similar sign added ‘You are in our prayers.’\n\n\n\nTeams of workers, many of them volunteers, prepared the Chalk Hill school with fresh paint and new furniture and even raised bathroom floors so the smaller elementary school students can reach the toilets. The students' desks, backpacks and other belongings that were left behind following the shooting were taken to the new school to make them feel at home.\n\nSupport: A sign is seen along the route to the Chalk Hill School where the Sandy Hook Elementary School children will attend classes in Monroe, Connecticut\n\nEarly days: Teachers and volunteers have worked to remodel the middle school to appear as close as possible to Sandy Hook in order to reassure the children\n\nCounselors say it's important for children to get back to a normal routine and for teachers and parents to offer sensitive reassurances.\n\n\n\nWhen classes start, Robinson said teachers will try to make it as normal a school day as possible for the children.\n\n\n\n‘We want to get back to teaching and learning,’ she said. ‘We will obviously take time out from the academics for any conversations that need to take place, and there will be a lot of support there. All in all, we want the kids to reconnect with their friends and classroom teachers, and I think that's going to be the healthiest thing.’\n\n\n\nActing Sandy Hook principal Donna Page wrote on the school's website: 'Be assured that the towns of Monroe and Newtown are working night and day to ensure the facility is safe, secure and fully operational for our return.'\n\nWatchful: Children are seen on a school bus driving toward Chalk Hill School as they return to class for the first time since the December 14 tragedy\n\nIn remembrance: A green and white ribbon, the colors of Sandy Hook Elementary School, is seen attached to a bus on the first day that students returned Friendly town: A sign is seen along the route to the Chalk Hill School in Monroe which has been turned over to Sandy Hook survivors Familiarity: Classes will resume at a re-purposed school in the neighboring town of Monroe, where measures have been put in place to make as many things as possible familiar to the children\n\nMemorial: Local volunteers installed 26 stars on the roof of the Newtown fire house on January 1st in honor of the victims of the shooting\n\nMs Page took on the role after the elementary school's principal Dawn Hochsprung was killed in the attack.\n\nShe added that parents who wanted to come with their children to the first day of classes on Thursday would be made welcome.\n\n\n\nSandy Hook school in Newtown remains closed and has no date scheduled for reopening. It remains a crime scene following the December massacre.\n\n\n\nFather David Connors said his eight-year-old triplets have suffered nightmares, jumped at noises and clung to their parents since they escaped the shooting.\n\nMr Connors said: 'I'm nervous about it. It's unchartered waters for us. I know it's going to be difficult.'\n\nConnors, a 40-year-old engineer, said he felt reassured after recently visiting the new setup. He said his children were excited to see their backpacks and coats, and that the family was greeted by a police officer at the door and grief counselors in the hallways.\n\nVIDEO Classrooms are readied for Sandy Hook students\n\nNever forget: One of the many memorials for the 20 Sandy Hook students killed in Newtown on December 14 along with six teaching staff\n\nDevastation: Sandy Hook Elementary School, home to 700 students, was attacked by a crazed gunman on Friday, December 14, and changed the course of history\n\n\n\nTeachers will try to make it as normal a school day as possible for the children, schools Superintendent Robinson said.\n\n'We want to get back to teaching and learning,' she said. 'We will obviously take time out from the academics for any conversations that need to take place, and there will be a lot of support there. All in all, we want the kids to reconnect with their friends and classroom teachers, and I think that's going to be the healthiest thing.'\n\nTeachers are returning as well, and some have already been working on their classrooms. At some point, all those will be honored, but officials are still working out how and when to do so, Robinson said.\n\n'Everyone was part and parcel of getting as many kids out of there safely as they could,' she said.\n\n'Almost everybody did something to save kids. One art teacher locked her kids in the kiln room, and I got a message from her on my cellphone saying she wouldn't come out until she saw a police badge.'\n\nAfter the evacuation, teachers grouped their children at a nearby fire station, Robinson said. One sang songs, while others read to the students, she said.\n\nJulian Ford, a clinical psychologist at the University of Connecticut who helped counsel families in the days immediately following the shooting, recommended addressing it as questions come up but otherwise focusing on regular school work.\n\nBack to class: Superintendent Janet Robinson said they will try to make everything as normal as possible for the children and welcome them to the new school\n\nFear: Parents are apprehensive about their children returning to school following the Sandy Hook shooting\n\nVictims: Top row- (L-R) Ana Marquez-Greene, Caroline Previdi, Jessica Rekos, Emilie Parker, Noah Pozner.

On Thursday, when they returned to school for the first time, in another town, their things were waiting for them, and so were their desks—their actual desks, moved to what had been the empty shell of the former Chalk Hill middle school in Monroe, Connecticut. The school authorities brought along everything they could, to make the children feel that they were in a familiar place, or as familiar as it could be. The older children would recognize Donna Page, the new principal who greeted them—she had been their principal already, before she retired, in 2010, and was replaced by Dawn Hochsprung, who died trying to stop the man who’d broken into her school carrying an assault rifle and two other guns. After the shooting, Page called the parents who were working to get the school reopened to say that she was there if they needed her. (“I started crying when I heard the message,” a mother told ABC.) Page would have remembered the third graders from when they were in kindergarten.\n\nOnce the school day started, there was circle time, greetings, class activities. “A lot of them were happy to see their friends they hadn’t seen in a while,” a police captain told the AP. It’s hard to be home for weeks in the winter. There was also extra security, grief counselors, and an assembly for parents—the old school is still a crime scene, their children still have nightmares, and they are so much luckier than the parents of the twenty children whose backpacks were not sent along to the new school, and will never outgrow the coats that they left there. There, too, the disquieting sense that the moment after the shooting, when it seemed clear that something needed to be done about guns, might be dissipating. Vice-President Biden is leading an effort to come up with proposals for the President, we’ve been told; but then he was needed for the fiscal-cliff negotiations, and tomorrow there may be another crisis. The one with guns won’t go away.\n\nOne can only hope for normalcy for the children who took school buses to Chalk Hill on Thursday morning. They should be able to sleep without thinking about the day the shooter came to their school. But the rest of us don’t deserve that sort of complacency, or peace.

The report notes that he had compiled a spreadsheet recording mass murders over the years, giving information on each event.\n\nHe had a particular fixation with the Columbine high school tragedy of April 1999, in which two students killed 12 other students and a teacher in Colorado. Lanza also kept a cutting from the New York Times on a 2008 shooting at Northern Illinois university and was in possession of a book, Amish Grace: How Forgiveness Transcended Tragedy, about a 2006 rampage in an Amish school in Nickel Mines, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe report also illuminates the lengths to which Lanza went in planning the killings. GPS routes found on a device he purchased showed that he had scouted out Sandy Hook elementary school the day before he carried out the attacks.\n\nThe new evidence of Lanza’s state of mind in the lead up to the Sandy Hook killings will fuel the debate about mental-health treatment and gun-control laws in the US. Despite making it a top priority of his second term in office, President Barack Obama has struggled to persuade Congress to move forward on new legislation to tighten background checks on gun sales.\n\nBut the report makes it clear that there was no evidence Lanza had received formal medical treatment for any mental-health issues he might have had. In 2005 he was given a diagnosis of Asperger’s, a syndrome on the autism spectrum, and was described to investigators as “presenting with significant social impairments and extreme anxiety”. But he declined to take any medication for his condition and would not engage in therapy. The report concludes: “It is important to note that it is unknown what contribution, if any, the shooter’s mental health issues made to his attack … Those mental health professionals who saw him did not see anything that would have predicted his future behavior.”\n\nPeople affected by the terrible events of last December, as well as participants in the heated debate about gun laws in the US, have been hoping that the state attorney’s report would offer clues to the shooter’s motivation and prior treatment. But the report largely draws a blank on many of the most pressing questions. It finds clearly that Lanza acted alone, and as a result declares the investigation officially closed. But beyond that investigators confess to being baffled.\n\nThe report says: “The obvious question that remains is: ‘Why did the shooter murder 26 people, including 20 children?’ Unfortunately, that question may never be answered conclusively, despite the collection of extensive background information on the shooter through a multitude of interviews and other sources.”\n\nIt goes on: “The evidence clearly shows that the shooter planned his actions, including the taking of his own life, but there is no clear indication why he did so, or why he targeted Sandy Hook elementary school.”\n\nOne aspect of the report that is likely to be pored over by both sides of the gun control debate is the evidence of Lanza's computer game obsessions that was discovered in his bedroom in the basement of his Newtown home. The investigation report lists 12 video games, found in the gaming area of the room, which had violent content, including popular titles such as Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto . Others included Left for Dead, Dead Rising, Vice City and Doom.\n\nA computer game called School Shooting, which features a character controlled by the player who enters a school and shoots students, was also found.\n\nThe report gives a chronology of the events of 14 December which underlines the scale of violence that Lanza inflicted in a remarkably compressed time frame. The first 911 call was received by Newtown police department at 9.35.39am. The last gunshot, believed to be the shot with which Lanza killed himself, was heard at 9.40.03 – just four minutes and 24 seconds later. In that time he killed 20 children, aged five and six, and six of their school guardians. The report gives a sense of how he managed it: in total he was armed with 301 live rounds of ammunition, 154 of which he fired, mainly with his Bushmaster .223-caliber semi-automatic rifle.\n\nIn response to Newtown, Obama tried to have semi-automatic weapons removed from sale in the US. He was rebuffed by both chambers of Congress.\n\nThe report also highlights the tragedy of Lanza’s mother, Nancy, who he killed at the home he shared with her before setting off for Sandy Hook school. All the guns used in the incident – the Bushmaster, a Glock pistol which he used to kill himself, a Savage Mark II rifle with which he shot his mother in her bed, and others – were owned by Nancy Lanza.\n\nShe took her son to shooting ranges, to learn how to use guns. She had also written out a check which she intended to give her son as a Christmas present – it would allow him to buy himself a CZ 83 pistol. In another painful irony, Nancy and Adam both took gun safety courses offered by the National Rifle Association.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Computer games found in Adam Lanza's bedroom. Photograph: AP\n\nNancy was concerned enough about her son’s Asperger’s to read on the subject – in her house investigators found copies of two books, Look Me in the Eye – My Life With Asperger’s, and Born on a Blue Day – Inside the Mind of an Autistic Savant. The report says: “The mother took care of all of the shooter’s needs. The mother indicated that she did not work because of her son’s condition. She worried about what would happen to the shooter if anything happened to her.\n\n“One witness indicated that Lanza did not have an emotional connection to his mother. Recently, when his mother had asked him if he would feel bad if anything happened to her, he had replied, ‘No.’”\n\nThe newly-released material includes photographs taken from Lanza’s bedroom, including some of his firearms and video games. But it does not include pictures of the victims. The law was changed in Connecticut in the wake of the massacre, to prevent such images becoming public.\n\nThe decision to release only a heavily edited summary of the police report, as opposed to the full version that is thought to run to thousands of pages, has landed the lead investigator in the Sandy Hook tragedy, state's attorney Stephen Sedensky, in controversy. Normal procedure would be for the full report to be put out first, though in this case the authorities have come under intense pressure from families of the children who died.\n\nIn a separate event in a court in New Britain, Connecticut, on Monday, Sedensky argued before a judge that the recordings of 911 calls at the time of the shootings should not be released, in order to spare the agony of bereaved parents. The Associated Press has been pressing for the 40-minutes of recordings to be released and the Connecticut freedom of information commission has agreed. The courts will make a final decision on the dispute.", 'title': 'Sandy Hook report – shooter Adam Lanza was obsessed with mass murder', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/25/sandy-hook-shooter-adam-lanza-report', 'keywords': ['sandy', 'lanza', 'adam', 'school', 'mass', 'children', 'murder', 'shooter', 'lanzas', 'mother', 'hook', 'report', 'tragedy', 'obsessed'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'The report notes that he had compiled a spreadsheet recording mass murders over the years, giving information on each event.\nHe had a particular fixation with the Columbine high school tragedy of April 1999, in which two students killed 12 other students and a teacher in Colorado.\nGPS routes found on a device he purchased showed that he had scouted out Sandy Hook elementary school the day before he carried out the attacks.\nThe new evidence of Lanza’s state of mind in the lead up to the Sandy Hook killings will fuel the debate about mental-health treatment and gun-control laws in the US.\nThe report also highlights the tragedy of Lanza’s mother, Nancy, who he killed at the home he shared with her before setting off for Sandy Hook school.', 'date': 1385337600}, {'text': 'Story highlights Adam Lanza gave "no clear indication" that he planned Sandy Hook killings, report finds\n\nLanza wrote stories about killer "Granny," saved newspaper reprints about mass murders\n\nThe report is "yet another blow" to family of slain teacher, family says\n\nStill-unreleased police file on Lanza will run thousands of pages, spokesman says\n\nIn the years leading up to the December 2012 massacre at Connecticut\'s Sandy Hook Elementary School, Adam Lanza went from a merely shy pre-teen to a mentally ill recluse obsessed with school shootings.\n\nBut during that long descent, Lanza never gave anyone any indication that he would one day turn a gun on his mother and then storm his onetime grade school with a semiautomatic rifle, killing 20 first-graders and six adults, investigators reported Monday.\n\nAnd so Connecticut authorities closed the book on the second-deadliest shooting in U.S. history with the motive still a mystery. Lanza shot himself at the end of his 11-minute rampage, and police found no sign that he "voiced or gave any indication to others that he intended to commit such a crime himself," according to a 44-page summary of the investigation, released Monday.\n\n"The evidence clearly shows that the shooter planned his actions, including the taking of his own life, but there is no clear indication why he did so, or why he targeted Sandy Hook Elementary School," the report states.\n\nThough he had attended Sandy Hook from first through fifth grades, investigators found no sign the 20-year-old was targeting any student, teacher or other employee at the school.\n\nPhotos: Reaction to Newtown school killings Photos: Reaction to Newtown school killings Reaction to Newtown school killings – Candles burn next to a lighted tree at a makeshift shrine in Newtown, Connecticut, commemorating the victims of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012.

MUST WATCH Report: Sandy Hook motive inconclusive 02:31\n\n"In fact, as best as can be determined, the shooter had no prior contact with anyone in the school that day," the report states.\n\nLanza "had significant mental health issues that affected his ability to live a normal life and to interact with others," the report states. "What contribution this made to the shootings, if any, is unknown as those mental health professionals who saw him did not see anything that would have predicted his future behavior."\n\nThe killings in Newtown, about 60 miles outside New York, happened less than five months after a similar bloodbath at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, outside Denver. Those mass slayings triggered a nationwide debate over gun violence, school safety and mental health -- a debate that produced some new restrictions on firearms in several states. But it also yielded a backlash against those laws by gun-rights advocates and only limited action on a federal level after a Republican filibuster blocked expanded background checks for gun buyers.\n\nVarious witnesses described a fifth-grade Lanza as quiet but bright: "He wouldn\'t necessarily engage in conversation, but wouldn\'t ignore one," the report states. He attended parties, enjoyed music and played the saxophone.\n\nBut the same year, according to investigators, Lanza produced something called the "Big Book of Granny" -- in which a woman armed with a gun in her cane goes on killing sprees with her son, with children sometimes the targets. The story was related to a class project, but apparently never was handed in to the school, the report notes.\n\n"It can\'t be a red flag if nobody sees it," Casey Jordan, a criminologist at Western Connecticut State University in Danbury, told CNN\'s Erin Burnett OutFront.\n\nBy late middle school, Lanza "did not like noise and confusion and began to have issues when he had to walk to different classes," the report states. He didn\'t want to be in a crowd. He started receiving tutoring and home schooling. By ninth grade, he was "shutting himself in the bedroom and playing video games all day."\n\n"He was so enormously isolated," Jordan said. "His mother was not allowed in his room. No one was. So this didn\'t happen overnight. This was years of him slowly withdrawing, and we have that history going back to fifth grade, sixth grade."\n\nAs a child, Lanza had seizures and washed his hands excessively. In 2005, he was diagnosed with Asperger\'s syndrome, with doctors noting he "lacked empathy" and showed "extreme anxiety and discomfort with changes, noise, and physical contact with others." In high school, where he took part in a school tech club, Lanza never spoke of violence, but "was also remembered for pulling his sleeves over his hand to touch something," the report states.\n\nAfter the shooting, investigators found that Lanza had sorted out the details of school shootings and other mass murders in spreadsheets. Among the clippings he kept was a reprint of a story in The New York Times about a man who shot at schoolchildren in 1891, wounding several with a shotgun. His computer contained two videos depicting gunshot suicides, two pictures of Lanza pointing guns at his own head and movies depicting school shootings.\n\nBut while many of his video games were violent, others were not. For months before the killings at Sandy Hook, he would go to a movie theater on weekends to play the dance game "Dance Dance Revolution" for hours, the report recounts.\n\nLanza lived with his mother, 52-year-old Nancy Lanza, after his parents split up in 2001. Nancy Lanza "took care of all of the shooter\'s needs" and "worried about what would happen to the shooter if anything happened to her," according to the report.\n\nIt didn\'t sound easy: The shooter was particular about the food that he ate and its arrangement on a plate in relation to other foods on the plate," the report recounts. "Certain types of dishware could not be used for particular foods. The mother would shop for him and cook to the shooter\'s specifications, though sometimes he would cook for himself."\n\nNancy Lanza did her son\'s laundry every day, but was not allowed into his room -- "No one was allowed in his room," where the windows were covered with black plastic trash bags, the report notes. Adam Lanza "disliked birthdays, Christmas and holidays," forbidding his mother from putting up a Christmas tree: "The mother explained it by saying that shooter had no emotions or feelings."\n\nHe was not medicated: Lanza "did not drink alcohol, take drugs, prescription or otherwise, and hated the thought of doing any of those things," investigators found. An autopsy found no sign of drugs in his system at the time of the killings, the report states.\n\nOne person described Lanza\'s relationship with his mother as "strained," while another told investigators he didn\'t appear to have "an emotional connection to his mother." But others said Nancy Lanza "was the only person to whom the shooter would talk."\n\nLanza\'s mother "tried within her limits" to help her son live a normal life, Jordan said, but "we have a society that shames mental illness."\n\n"The mother was overwhelmed, did not know what to do with him and did allow him to isolate," Jordan said. "She tried to bring him out with the one activity they had in common, which was going to the shooting range."\n\nNancy Lanza grew up with firearms and "thought it was good to learn responsibility for guns," the report states. Both she and Adam Lanza shot pistols at a local range, where Adam "was described as quiet and polite." There was a large but undisclosed number of weapons in the home, all of which had been purchased by Nancy Lanza.\n\nOn December 14, 2012, the morning after Nancy Lanza had returned from a trip to New Hampshire, her son shot her four times in the head with a .22-caliber rifle. Then it was off to the school where he once had been a relatively happy child, packing four other guns and nearly 500 rounds of ammunition. He fired more than 150 shots from a .223-caliber Bushmaster rifle before turning a 10mm Glock pistol on himself once police arrived, according to the report.\n\nMonday\'s report is separate from a much longer evidence file that Connecticut State Police will release at an unspecified date. That cache will be "thousands of pages long," according to Connecticut State Police spokesman Paul Vance.\n\nThe documents will include witness statements, a timeline of events and background on Lanza, and Vance said he believes they will offer a motive. The file is still being reviewed, with witness names and other identifying information being redacted, and there is no scheduled date for its release, Vance said.\n\nBut the family of Victoria Soto, a teacher who shielded her students before being shot to death, said Monday\'s release is "yet another blow that our family has been dealt."\n\nA statement from the family said, "While others search for the answer as to why this happened, we search for the how. How can we live without Vicki? How do we celebrate Christmas without Vicki? How do we go on every day missing a piece of our family? Those are the questions we seek the answers for. There is nothing in the report that will answer those for us."\n\nConnecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy said the report\'s release "will no doubt be difficult" for the relatives of those killed at Sandy Hook.\n\n"But if there is one thing that I believe we must do, it\'s that we must honor the lives that were lost by taking steps to protect ourselves from another horror like this," Malloy said. "I hope that the information in this summary and in the supporting documents that will be released by the State Police takes us closer to that goal."\n\nVictims\' family members were informed of the report, said Mark Dupuis, a spokesman for Danbury State\'s Attorney Stephen Sedensky, whose office conducted the investigation.\n\n"We are sensitive to the needs of the families, and those needs are being addressed," Dupuis said.', 'title': 'Sandy Hook killer Adam Lanza took motive to his grave', 'url': 'https://edition.cnn.com/2013/11/25/justice/sandy-hook-shooting-report/index.html', 'keywords': ['sandy', 'lanza', 'took', 'adam', 'photos', '80', 'newtown', 'killings', 'motive', 'killer', 'reaction', 'hook', 'school', 'caption', 'grave', 'hide'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Photos: Reaction to Newtown school killings Photos: Reaction to Newtown school killings Reaction to Newtown school killings – Candles burn next to a lighted tree at a makeshift shrine in Newtown, Connecticut, commemorating the victims of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012.\nHide Caption 4 of 80 Photos: Reaction to Newtown school killings Reaction to Newtown school killings – A woman bows her head in Newtown\'s Sandy Hook village on December 21.\nHide Caption 18 of 80 Photos: Reaction to Newtown school killings Reaction to Newtown school killings – Two women embrace before the interfaith vigil at Newtown High School on Sunday evening.\nHide Caption 45 of 80 Photos: Reaction to Newtown school killings Reaction to Newtown school killings – Flowers and signs of sympathy adorn the street leading to Sandy Hook Elementary School.\nDannel Malloy said the report\'s release "will no doubt be difficult" for the relatives of those killed at Sandy Hook.', 'date': 1385337600}, {'text': 'Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday Connecticut State’s Attorney Stephen J.

The long-awaited document is only a summary of the yet-to-be released final crime report, which is estimated to run thousands of pages, according to the Hartford Courant.\n\nThe summary report includes a timeline of the police response to Sandy Hook, starting with the first 911 call. It also offers some insight into the family history, interests, and mental health of shooter Adam Lanza. Included is an inventory of violent video games he owned, along with a record of some of the evidence recovered from Lanza’s hard drive, such as images of him brandishing weapons, movies depicting mass shootings, and videos of people committing suicide by gunshot.\n\nSedensky has been criticized for delaying the publication of the report and withholding 911 recordings, which are routinely released to the public. He is currently appealing a ruling by the state’s Freedom of Information Commission stating he must release the emergency calls.

I know this is true for most Americans, but for me it's especially true.\n\nMy mother, Mary Sherlach, was the school psychologist at Sandy Hook Elementary School. She was in her 18th year there and absolutely loved her school. That's what she always called it: her school. She was the most senior member of the staff and felt as though all the precious children in that building were her own flesh and blood.\n\nWhen danger appeared on the morning of Dec. 14, she acted as a mother. She put herself in harm's way and helped to slow an unimaginable evil that had been unleashed on her kids and colleagues.\n\nSchool did it right\n\nDespite the nightmare that unfolded, it's important to recognize that Sandy Hook actually did it right when it came to school safety. Their doors were locked. They practiced their drills so much so that every teacher in that building knew exactly what to do that morning. When real danger appeared, they didn't pause. They didn't panic. They made decisions that saved lives. Thanks to their quick reactions, the police arrived a mere four minutes after the shooting started. That was vital in reducing the number of casualties that morning.\n\nAbout three weeks after the shooting, I found myself back teaching music in Salem, N.J. And I felt safe. I still do. We have a variety of security measures, including locked doors, regular emergency drills, a full-time school resource officer who is an active-duty police officer, and a security guard at our front door.\n\nI also believe our school's climate contributes greatly to our safety. When I walk around the halls, I see teachers and students treating each other with kindness and respect.\n\nNo guns in schools\n\nWhat I don't see — and I hope never to see — are teachers walking around with loaded weapons. After the shooting at Sandy Hook, I watched in shock as some argued that arming teachers and administrators would make us safer.\n\nI disagree wholeheartedly. The presence of guns in schools will always increase the risk of gun violence, whether through accidental or intentional use. As a teacher, it sickens me to think of my administration, my colleagues, even me, being pressured to carry guns.\n\nI find it hard to understand how many of the same people who want teachers like me to come to class armed have done so little to keep guns away from people who shouldn't have them. Even though more than 90% of Americans favor background checks on all gun purchases, Congress has failed to act on common-sense reforms that would save lives.\n\nI urge you to make your voice heard. Contact your elected officials and tell them that you will no longer tolerate inaction on gun reform. Galvanize the parents and teachers in your community to fight for sane policies. Find out how you can start making a difference. It is up to the parents and the teachers of America to fix our broken gun laws.\n\nMy mother was a hero.

A year ago on Saturday, in a bucolic corner of Connecticut that was known for little except the quality of life enjoyed by its citizens, 20 young children and six teaching staff were killed as they began another ordinary day at Sandy Hook elementary school.\n\nThere had been horrors like Sandy Hook before. Aurora, Virginia Tech, Columbine – but this time, the age of the children involved seemed to hold a particular power. Such was the groundswell of support for reform of America\'s notoriously lax gun laws that it seemed the political logjam might finally be broken.\n\nBut in April, any hopes for a bipartisan effort to combat such gun violence were dashed in what the president, Barack Obama, described as a "pretty shameful day" for the Senate. After the most repugnant mass shooting in the nation, a bipartisan bill on background checks failed within five votes of passing the Senate.\n\nA year on, amid vigils and memorial events for those murdered by Adam Lanza, who also killed his mother and himself, campaigners for gun control say they will once more push for Congress to act. They say they are picking up grassroots support, and that sweeping reform in states such as California is a template for what can be achieved.\n\nHowever, an analysis of the legislative changes in the last year across the states shows an expansion of gun rights. Since December 2012, 27 states have passed 93 laws expanding gun rights, while only 43 gun control laws have passed, according to a map published by PBS Frontline and the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence this week.\n\nGun control advocates say such statistics do not provide a true picture of the kind of progress they have made. Joint analysis by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence shows that, in eight states, there was sweeping gun reform in 2013.\n\nThe analysis shows that Connecticut, where the tragedy happened, Maryland, Delaware, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Colorado and California all made significant changes to strengthen gun control laws, with five states passing new laws requiring background checks on all gun sales. Illinois also passed legislation allowing concealed weapons to be carried in public.\n\nNewly formed groups such as Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense have amassed thousands of new members and have chapters all over the country. Americans for Responsible Solutions, a group run by Gabrielle Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman who was shot in the head in a mass shooting in Tucson that killed six in 2011, raised $6.1m for gun control. Moms Demand Action have launched a powerful ad, backed by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, calling for an end to the "silence" over gun control. Laura Cutilletta, a staff attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, described the level of support for gun control advocates this year as "unprecedented".\n\nHer group\'s main mission in 2014 will be to have another crack at getting background check legislation through Congress. The Brady campaign has said it is working with federal lawmakers to this effect.\n\nThey want to tighten rules that govern the sales of guns at gun shows and online, which are not currently subject to a background checks, and which make up 40% of all sales.\n\nThis year, gun control groups said they had spent five times as much on federal lobbying as they did the previous year. However, according to the Sunlight Foundation, the amount spent in the first six months of 2013, $1.6m, was still dwarfed by the $12.2m spend by the gun rights lobby, headed by the National Rifle Association (NRA). Both sides of the gun control debate also spent millions on television advertising and were active in the state elections.\n\nBill Allison, the editorial director of the Sunlight Foundation, told the Guardian: "One year later a lot of money has been spent and not a lot has changed. A few states have come out with stronger laws, but there have also been weakening of gun control laws and permits to carry."\n\nAllison said that while the gun control lobby was beginning to see much more money than before, led by Michael Bloomberg, New York\'s outgoing mayor, and others, it was no match for the NRA.\n\n"But what the pro-gun rights lobby has is grassroots, boots on the ground. They can mobilise people. They have been operating like this for decades. There was a belief, right after Sandy Hook, that the gun rights lobby was in disarray. The NRA had a few disastrous press conferences. But it is a well-oiled machine that has been around for years."\n\nAllison is sceptical that gun control advocates have the clout they need against the NRA. "The gun control movement is very passionate but it is still not very organised," he said. "Even with the money, they still can\'t match the organisation, the email lists, the permanent advocates of the NRA."\n\nRichard Feldman of the Independent Firearms Owners Association said that, following Newtown, "we squandered the opportunity to articulate the problem with the misuse of guns and to design policies accordingly". Feldman said he supported the final version of the Senate background check bill proposed in April and believed that had it started out that way, it would have got through. But because of previous measures proposed, including one put forward by the senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, to include an assault weapons ban, gun owners had already made their minds up to oppose it.\n\nHer measure failed to make it to the final Senate bill.\n\n"Much of the debate had centred on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines," said Feldman. "We think it is reasonable to provide for checks at gun shows just like gun shops. But frankly, I\'ll be damned if I\'m going to run a background check on my wife or my daughter if they need a gun."', 'title': 'Sandy Hook: one year on, campaigners prepare for new push on gun control', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/13/sandy-hook-campaigners-push-gun-control', 'keywords': ['sandy', 'states', 'violence', 'prevent', 'background', 'laws', 'prepare', 'shows', 'gun', 'campaigners', 'spent', 'push', 'hook', 'control', 'rights'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Gun control advocates say such statistics do not provide a true picture of the kind of progress they have made.\nJoint analysis by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence shows that, in eight states, there was sweeping gun reform in 2013.\nLaura Cutilletta, a staff attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, described the level of support for gun control advocates this year as "unprecedented".\nThere was a belief, right after Sandy Hook, that the gun rights lobby was in disarray.\n"We think it is reasonable to provide for checks at gun shows just like gun shops.', 'date': 1386892800}, {'text': "About Your Privacy on this Site\n\nWelcome!

A score of families are saying goodbye to their 6 and 7-year-olds because a troubled loner got hold of a weapon designed for war. Another unstable killer; another hole in our nation\'s heart. But this time they\'re burying children.\n\nThat incomprehensible fact distinguishes Newtown from the all-too-familiar litany in what has become the year of the mass shooting (there have been seven in 2012 alone, fully one tenth of the total number over the last 30 years, according to a tally by the New Republic\'s Amy Sullivan). But from that awful darkness comes the glimmer of hope that we might cause trouble for a sea of arms and, by opposing, end this senseless violence. Because today people aren\'t just futilely saying, as they have over and over, "never again." Today they\'re saying that this changes everything. And it just might.\n\nIt is hard to read President Obama\'s speech at the Sandy Hook vigil and not see that he was speaking both as the nation\'s mourner in chief but also as an angry parent who, like the rest of us, looks at the list of slain children and ponders some form of, "There but for the grace of God…."\n\nCaring for our children is our first job, the results of which are "how, as a society, we will be judged," the president said Sunday. "And by that measure, can we truly say, as a nation, that we are meeting our obligations? … If we\'re honest with ourselves, the answer is no."\n\nHe went on to say: "We can\'t tolerate this anymore. These tragedies must end. And to end them we must change." Then he put his presidency where his words are: "I will use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens—from law enforcement to mental health professionals to parents and educators—in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this."\n\nThat is the kind of call to action that, for example, was absent in Obama\'s superb speech following the attack upon Gabby Giffords and her staff and constituents. That talk focused more on the tone of our national discourse ("If this tragedy prompts reflection and debate—as it should—let\'s make sure it\'s worthy of those we have lost") than the content.\n\nReading the president\'s remarks promising action after last week\'s shooting, I wonder if Newtown may become Obama\'s 9/11. I mean that in two ways.\n\nFirst, the September 11 attacks created an opportunity to enact policies that wasn\'t there on September 10, 2001, from the Patriot Act to, ultimately, the invasion of Iraq. The shock of Newtown is forcing a re-evaluation of certain political truths about the invincibility of the gun lobby and the radioactive nature of gun control as a Democratic Party issue. After the 1994 congressional elections and the 2000 presidential election, Democrats concluded that trying to control guns was not a winning political issue.\n\nNow even prominent defenders of gun rights in the party are acknowledging that a hard line on the issue is no longer tenable. See, for example, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin saying this week on MSNBC\'s Morning Joe that "everything should be on the table." And see Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, who has an "A" rating from the National Rifle Association, calling the shooting a "game changer" and supporting "stricter rules on the books."\n\nWhat those pols will find is that, contra conventional wisdom, gun control should no longer be a verboten issue for Democrats. As the Washington Post\'s Greg Sargent and National Journal\'s Ron Brownstein have noted, the changing demographics that propelled President Obama to a surprisingly comfortable re-election make the issue a political winner for Democrats. "Gun control is now overwhelmingly unpopular among the portions of the white electorate Obama is least likely to win anyway—and maintains solid majority support among the Americans most likely to actually vote for him," Brownstein wrote in July. Just as cultural issues like gay marriage have rapidly become politically potent for Democrats, Sargent notes, so too might gun control.\n\nAnd while Republican officeholders have not yet shown the same willingness to reconsider their death grip on "Second Amendment issues," prominent conservatives like Joe Scarborough give reason to hope that sanity may yet prevail on the issue. Scarborough was a four-term congressman from Florida who earned the highest marks from the NRA while in Congress. But, he wrote in Politico on Monday, echoing comments he made on his show that morning, "Friday changed everything. It must change everything. We all must begin anew and demand that Washington\'s old way of doing business is no longer acceptable."\n\nAnd in his statements since the tragedy Obama has talked not just about gun control but about access to mental healthcare, the issue of violence in our culture, and the fact that any solution begins "inside the home and inside our hearts." This suggests the kind of balanced approach that will appeal to common sense moderates and make it hard for the gun lobby to paint him as a knee jerk liberal trying to round up hunting rifles.\n\nSecond, and more personal to Obama, the potential exists for Newtown to shape the president\'s second term in a way similar to how 9/11 shaped Bush\'s presidency. It may not define Obama\'s next four years in office the way 9/11 defined Bush\'s tenure, but there could be a similarity in terms of it being an issue that, in a terrible instant, goes from being hardly on the president\'s radar to the top of his agenda.\n\nWe can hope that it will. We can hope that the president will match his actions to his words. And we can act to help him.\n\nWe must, because they\'re burying children in Connecticut.\n\nRead Peter Fenn: The N.R.A.

He downloaded material about the two boys who shot 12 fellow students and a teacher at Columbine high school in 1999.\n\nThe authorities heavily redacted the final reports and photographs to protect the names of children and withhold some of the most gruesome details, but it still conveys the horror of those six minutes inside the school, There were photographs inside the Lanza home showing numerous rounds of ammunition, gun magazines, shot-up paper targets from a practise range, gun cases, shooting earplugs and an open gun safe with a rifle in it.\n\nA target practice chart found in the Lanza home (REUTERS)\n\nA rifle lies on the floor of the bedroom where Lanza shot his mother as she lay. Near it is a book titled "Train Your Brain to Get Happy".\n\nThe New York Daily News earlier quoted an unnamed source as saying that the boy photographed in combat gear holding a pistol was Adam. But Mr Lanza\'s spokesman said that he “no familiarity” with the picture and that it did not show Adam or Ryan.\n\nHowever, in a book released last month, Marvin LaFontaine, an old family friend, described how Adam was "comfortable with a firearm" at the age of just four.\n\nHe said that Mrs Lanza would bring her two young sons to his property for shooting practice. "From the beginning you could tell that Adam liked the feel of the gun in his hands," he said.\n\nThe book, Newtown: An American Tragedy, continued: "The Ruger was lightweight and easy to handle and, in Nancy\'s opinion, the ideal weapon for her young child.\n\n"Adam\'s tiny face would tense up as he concentrated while his mother would patiently go over, step by step, the proper hold and technique for the firearm."\n\nThe new report details how Lanza went on his killing spree the morning after his mother returned from a two-day trip away to New Hampshire. She told an acquaintance that she took the excursion "as an experiment to allow Adam to stay at home alone for a few days".\n\nA former teacher told investigators that as a teen, Lanza exhibited anti-social behaviour, rarely mixed with other students and wrote obsessively "about battles, destruction and war".\n\nThe teacher said: "I have known boys to talk about things like this, but Adam\'s level of violence was disturbing. [His] creative writing was so graphic that it could not be shared."\n\nThe documents also gave the fullest version of the terrifying events inside the school after Lanza shot his way in through the locked front door at 9.34am. Rick Thorne, the janitor, was heard by other staff members bravely confronting the heavily armed intruder.\n\nOne teacher, who was hiding in a cupboard, heard Mr Thorne yelling: "Put the gun down!" And a teaching aide said that after she heard gunfire, the janitor told her to close her door and take cover. Mr Thorne survived the rampage.\n\nKaitlin Roig, a teacher, described the blasts of "rapid-fire shooting" near her classroom. She rushed her charges into the classroom\'s bathroom, pulled a storage unit in front of the door as a barricade and then locked it. At one stage, she heard a voice say, "Oh, please, no. Please, no."\n\nWhen police officers arrived and slid their badges under the bathroom door, she still refused to come out, telling them that if they were genuine, they would be able to find the key to open the door - which they did.\n\nFor others, however, there was no escape. Lt Christopher Vanghele described how he and another officer found about 15 bodies packed into another bathroom. So many had tried desperately to hide they apparently could not close the door as Lanza bore down on them.\n\nIn a letter accompanying the files, Reuben Bradford, state commissioner for emergency services and public protection, said that much of the report and imagery was too disturbing to release. But he added: "In the midst of the darkness of that day, we also saw remarkable heroism and glimpses of grace."\n\nLanza was diagnosed in 2006 with "profound autism spectrum disorder, with rigidity, isolation and a lack of comprehension of ordinary social interaction and communications," while also displaying symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\nBut Robert King, a professor at Yale\'s Child Study Centre, told investigators that he observed nothing in the teen\'s behaviour that would have predicted he would become a mass killer.\n\nKathleen Koenig, a nurse at the centre, said that the teenager obsessively washed his hands and changed his socks up to 20 times a day.\n\nShe said that Mrs Lanza declined to give him prescribed antidepressant and antianxiety medication because she blamed the drugs for problems he had raising his arm.\n\nMs Koenig assured his mother that the medicine was not responsible, but to no avail, and Mrs Lanza did not schedule a follow-up visit after her son missed an appointment.\n\nPeter Lanza, who had not seen his son since 2010, told police that his child had Asperger\'s syndrome - a type of autism. Among the images released on Friday was a photograph of an undated birthday card that he had sent to Adam, inviting him to "send me an email when you want to go hiking or shooting".\n\nMrs Lanza maintained an upbeat outward appearance with friends, even as she acknowledged that her son\'s problems were worsening. During her trip to New Hampshire, she "described a difficult life but gave the impression that she was courageous and \'handling everything\'" to a male acquaintance over lunch.\n\nShe "accepted the obligations of caring for Adam" and was "very proud of Adam\'s accomplishments", the acquaintance said.\n\nBut the documents also throw lights on his recent decline. An ex-boyfriend told police that she cancelled a trip to London just days before the shooting because of "a couple last-minute problems on the home front".\n\nDespite living together, they only communicated by email and he had told her that he would not feel bad if something happened to her.\n\nMrs Lanza told a friend two weeks earlier that her son was "increasingly despondent" and that he had refused to leave his room for three months. She said that he had been sent "over the edge" after their house lost power following Hurricane Sandy in late October 2012.', 'title': "Sandy Hook report reveals Lanza children's early exposure to guns", 'url': 'https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10540688/Sandy-Hook-report-reveals-Lanza-childrens-early-exposure-to-guns.html', 'keywords': ['sandy', 'early', 'told', 'teacher', 'lanza', 'school', 'adam', 'exposure', 'reveals', 'gun', 'childrens', 'mother', 'shot', 'hook', 'report', 'guns', 'door'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'A target practice chart found in the Lanza home (REUTERS)A rifle lies on the floor of the bedroom where Lanza shot his mother as she lay.\nA former teacher told investigators that as a teen, Lanza exhibited anti-social behaviour, rarely mixed with other students and wrote obsessively "about battles, destruction and war".\nThe documents also gave the fullest version of the terrifying events inside the school after Lanza shot his way in through the locked front door at 9.34am.\nSo many had tried desperately to hide they apparently could not close the door as Lanza bore down on them.\nMrs Lanza told a friend two weeks earlier that her son was "increasingly despondent" and that he had refused to leave his room for three months.', 'date': None}, {'text': "Parents leave a staging area after being reunited with their children following a shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School.

One man, Gene Rosen — who found six children and a bus driver in his driveway, brought them into his home, fed them and called parents to assure them that their children were safe — has been harassed by telephone, email and online by those who think he is lying about his actions, and is part of a conspiracy.\n\nRosen is not the first hero to be assaulted and insulted by conspiracy theorists with doubts. In 2002, when conspiracy theorist Bart Sibrel confronted astronaut Buzz Aldrin and called him a "coward and a liar" for faking the moon landings, the 72-year-old promptly punched Sibrel in the face.\n\nA group called the Sandy Hook Truther movement has emerged from the dust and chaos over the past weeks to claim that the school shooting was all a staged event. Though many Americans are outraged and incredulous that anyone could doubt that the tragedy even happened, the Sandy Hook school shootings follow classic conspiracy thinking. Here are a few reasons why.\n\nPoignant political implications\n\nShootings — even child murders — happen every day, several times a day, in America. According to UNICEF, America has the worst record of child abuse and homicide in the industrialized world, with an average of 27 children killed every week by their parents and caregivers. But those child murders don\'t have implications for enacting a national policy on gun control.\n\nMost events producing conspiracy theories have important social and political implications, and the Sandy Hook shootings are no exception. No one, regardless of what side of the gun control issue they are on, can deny that guns played a key role in the Sandy Hook killings. So the conspiracy theorists must instead challenge the claim that the attack even occurred. They believe it\'s all a hoax to scare people into supporting more gun control and a step toward an outright repeal of the Second Amendment. [5 Milestones in Gun Control History]\n\n\'Holes\' in the \'official story\'\n\nA common theme running through conspiracy thinking is that if you\'re smart enough, and just look closely enough at all the news coverage and available information, you can see lies and contradictions in accounts of the event. Truthers claim that they have found "absolute proof" that the shootings were a hoax, pointing to a 6-year-old girl named Emilie Parker, who was shot to death in the school massacre.\n\nOr was she? They claim that the smoking-gun photographic proof that Emilie is still alive is that she was photographed after the shooting with President Obama during a visit with the families. The girl is actually Emilie\'s sister, wearing the same dress that Emilie wore in another photograph.\n\nIn the topsy-turvy world of conspiracy thinking, any little girl who resembles Emilie and is wearing the same dress as one she owned must be her. It could not possibly be her sister, who could not possibly be wearing either Emilie\'s dress or an identical one. Instead, it\'s obviously proof that the whole shooting was faked.\n\nBut this claim, even if it were true, raises more questions than it answers. For example, if Sandy Hook was indeed a "staged event" as claimed, with Emilie Parker alive and the president part of the conspiracy, why would the government be so careless as to release a photograph of Emilie, knowing that she had been reported dead in a carefully orchestrated national hoax? Is a widely published photo opportunity with the president of the United States really the best place to hide someone who is supposedly dead?\n\nConspiracy theorist websites offer dozens of other examples and pieces of evidence, ranging from real or perceived contradictions in eyewitness accounts to conflicting news reports. And indeed there are some contradictions. [The 10 Most Bizarre Conspiracy Theories]\n\nThe minds of conspiracy theorists\n\nBut what the conspiratorial mind sees as misinformation and lies, others see as merely perfectly ordinary incomplete and inaccurate information following a multifaceted tragedy. Especially in the hours and first days after such a chaotic and horrifying event, witnesses can be confused and mistaken. Police officers and reporters can misspeak, or be given incorrect information.\n\nNot every single statement about what occurred, from dozens of different people in different places at different times, will agree in every detail. Three different witnesses to a minor car accident will often give three slightly different accounts of what they saw, so it\'s unrealistic to expect dozens of people who were involved in a chaotic school massacre to report exactly the same things.\n\nPart of the reason that conspiracy theories linger is that any contradictory evidence — no matter how conclusive or compelling — can just be dismissed by claiming that it\'s part of the cover-up. There is ultimately no evidence that would satisfy most conspiracy theorists. Those who distrust the government will use any excuse to support their beliefs, logical or not. Conspiracy theorists prefer complex mysteries over simple truths, and find mystery where none exists.\n\nResearch has shown not only that a person who believes in one conspiracy theory is likely to support others, but also contradictions don\'t deter conspiracy theorists.\n\nThe idea that the Sandy Hook massacre was faked is not only absurd, but also an insult to the victims of the tragedy. The victims are really, provably gone; they are not safely hidden away somewhere until the Sandy Hook shooting has served its ultimate goal of taking away America\'s guns. The bullet holes are there. The children and adults are dead.

Pale rays broke through a dull sky, streaking it white. It was the only signal on that chilly New England day that we and the few cars that bobbed by us on the road were approaching a zone of horror and grief. We saw a sign for Newtown / Sandy Hook and thought of how that vaguely maritime name conjures up a cheerful neighborhood tucked behind a dune. It was this sense, of the sheer ordinariness of driving by—how easy it was not to imagine what happened there—that made us want to stop and see the place.\n\nNot even a mile off the highway, small memorials have sprouted up—a stand of twenty-six white crosses plunged into the grass of a churchyard, photographs of the dead children hung by strings from tree branches. A few hundred yards away from Sandy Hook’s tidy, modest main street, parked cars lined the road. We were not alone in having thought to stop there, apparently. We walked along the icy sidewalk, toward the center of town. Up a hill, we could see policemen in neon vests directing traffic at the bottom of the street that lead to Sandy Hook Elementary School. Many families had come with their children, bearing flowers and stuffed animals. I saw a little girl laughing and squirming in her mother’s arms; the mom looked dazed.\n\nA main street with many institutions devoted to the care and entertainment of children—a karate academy, a kids’ barbershop, a music school advertising the Suzuki method, a store called The Toy Tree—is newly grim. People walked very slowly along the slippery street. No one we passed seemed sure how to adjust their faces. A church on our right had posted a laminated placard at the entrance to its parking lot saying “NO MEDIA.” In the window of the Sandy Hook Diner—a squat, cozy-looking building—a small green sign read “WE ARE SANDY HOOK, WE CHOOSE LOVE.” Another sign hung there, too, imploring residents to sign a petition advocating for an assault-weapons ban in Newtown. It was the only overtly political sign that we saw in town.\n\nGetting closer to the schoolhouse road, the makeshift memorial began: a cascading pile of stuffed animals, American flags, candles, photographs, wrapped presents, packets of candy, plastic toys, flowers, prayers, hand-drawn signs, pictures of weeping angles, wreaths, and Christmas ornaments that had been sent here from all over the country and beyond (I saw one message from a church in the Philippines, among innumerable others from abroad). The mass of toys stretched hundreds of feet up the street. A small bridge overlooking a rushing creek bore a large painted sign: “TOGETHER WE ARE STRONG.” An old sled had been repurposed into a kind of altar; someone had left as an offering their neatly folded varsity lacrosse jacket. In one storefront window, glimmering evening gowns seemed to loom over a pile of soggy stuffed animals and wilted flowers outside.\n\nAs we walked on, approaching the entrance to the school, a row of Christmas trees were arranged under a tent—one for each of the children who was killed. The trees seemed almost as if they were growing out of the mounds of offerings and were heavy with decorations. A little kid who didn’t know any better might have mistaken this display for the fantastical Christmas of his dreams: so many presents appearing overnight, flowing like a river along the street. One resident of the town who was watching over the display told me that more objects were pouring in every day—that, in fact, a nearby warehouse was filling up with shipments of gifts. What would happen to this great pile? He told me he’d heard that it would be cleared away after a few more days. The toys would be cleaned and distributed to children in the area. The flowers would be dried and ground up, and scattered over any future memorial.\n\nThe outpouring of objects—many of which were addressed to the murdered elementary schoolers—was no less ghastly for being heartfelt. The smiling monkeys and striped unicorns and glowing trinkets only made the children’ s absence more chilling. Tucked behind one of the trees hung a signpost: “Welcome to Sandy Hook Elementary.”\n\nWho were these gifts for? One poem, slipped into a plastic covering and nailed to a post, written from the perspective of one of the dead children who assured the reader that he was happily situated in heaven, brought out the touching absurdity of the display: Christmas gifts for children who will never receive them. The presents were tangible expressions of love and sorrow in response to intangible grief. They were also consolations for us, out-of-town pilgrims who sought some way to visualize what had happened, to grasp some part of it, and to share in the sadness. In a few weeks’ time, the area’s local Goodwills will be inundated with dirty teddy bears. For now, they are our frayed tethers to the dead.\n\nAlong the road, people snapped photos with their phones. Some seemed shy and a little embarrassed; others posed, clutching one another and smiling for the camera, in front of some of the anodyne, inspirational signs (“UNITED WE HEAL”; “WE LOVE YOU, SANDY HOOK”; “THEY ARE WITH GOD”). A row of red Christmas stockings arranged outside of Sandy Hook’s graveyard was especially picturesque. Maybe capturing it will be a spur to remembering it.\n\nWe pulled out of town a little after 2 P.M. A few miles away, next to the highway, someone had arranged a battery of tiny American flags under a little arc of Christmas lights. As we passed it, returning to the blankness of the highway, I thought of Auden’s poem, “Musée des Beaux Arts,” about Pieter Bruegel’s painting of Icarus’s fall:\n\nAbout suffering they were never wrong,\n\nThe old Masters: how well they understood\n\nIts human position: how it takes place\n\nWhile someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully along.\n\nWe drove away, back to New York.\n\nPhotographs by Sam Graham-Felsen.', 'title': 'Christmas Day in Sandy Hook', 'url': 'https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/christmas-day-in-sandy-hook', 'keywords': ['sandy', 'day', 'road', 'little', 'children', 'newtown', 'christmas', 'saw', 'sign', 'hook', 'street'], 'tags': {'Photography', 'Newtown Shooting'}, 'summary': 'We saw a sign for Newtown / Sandy Hook and thought of how that vaguely maritime name conjures up a cheerful neighborhood tucked behind a dune.\nA few hundred yards away from Sandy Hook’s tidy, modest main street, parked cars lined the road.\nUp a hill, we could see policemen in neon vests directing traffic at the bottom of the street that lead to Sandy Hook Elementary School.\nTucked behind one of the trees hung a signpost: “Welcome to Sandy Hook Elementary.”Who were these gifts for?\nA row of red Christmas stockings arranged outside of Sandy Hook’s graveyard was especially picturesque.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'Next week’s forecast for Newtown, Conn., is calling for hundreds of snowflakes to reach the small town recently devastated by a mass shooting.\n\nBut the snowflakes won’t fall to earth from the sky, nor will they stick to the ground.\n\nInstead, they will be driven in boxes across the border from Richmond Hill by Caren Italiano and her family, and stick to the walls of the new building where classes will resume for Sandy Hook Elementary School students in January.\n\nItaliano’s good friend, her daughters’ aunt, moved from Richmond Hill to Newtown 10 years ago.

One mother, in shock and disbelief, asked me simply: "How could this happen to my 6-year-old child?"\n\nThis was not a question; it was a cry of anguish, a searing lament from deep within this young, grieving woman. How to respond?\n\nI was one of a small group of volunteer Red Cross mental health professionals who had been dispatched to Sandy Hook immediately after the shootings to provide assistance to family members, first responders, and the community.\n\nWe worked alongside an extraordinary group of state troopers who were assigned to each family. We sought to both offer a compassionate presence -- simply bearing witness to intense grief and suffering -- and to provide more direct advice and counsel.\n\nBut the practice of early mental health response to tragedy and disaster remains controversial. The once-trusted practice of Psychological Debriefing (typically a one-session group therapy session for trauma survivors that follows a strict protocol) has been widely discredited, and some misguided counselors believe their job is to make the bereaved feel better or follow a strict "grief process" to reach the impossible goal of "closure." Some think there has been too much counseling, which can inhibit natural resilience. After the London subway bombing in 2005, no crisis counseling was offered. Instead, the National Health Service of the UK prescribed a period of "watchful waiting" followed months later with a "screen and treat program," therapy only for those who did not recover on their own.\n\nCan crisis counseling be helpful? It has not yet been proven, given the ethical difficulties of doing research in this situation. We certainly won\'t randomly assign survivors to receive help or not, nor is it appropriate to ask a grieving survivor to fill out a questionnaire assessing our services. American Red Cross counselors do take evidence-based risk factors into account in determining who to target. Was there a death in the family? Was someone injured? Was a home lost? Or did the victim suffer from a less severe form of trauma, like minor flooding or property loss? In the absence of a body of empirical research, we currently rely on clinical evidence, like what I experienced during the response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting one year ago.\n\nOur first priority was to help families feel safe by modeling calm and protecting them from exposure to unwelcome sights and sounds and an extremely intrusive press. Parents were concerned for their own safety as well as the safety of their surviving children. There were bomb scares, extremists who threatened to protest at funerals, rumors of more shootings, spontaneous memorials, vans moving furniture in and out of the school, funerals, police processions, and the world media with lights, cameras, satellite trucks and dishes, officials, and celebrities. We advised families on how to deal with the media. We encouraged thoughtful conversation about what families hoped to gain by telling their stories to the press and the public. We counseled families before, during, and after condolence calls from government officials including Governor Malloy and President Obama ("Is there something you want to say or ask him"). We reminded survivors to connect with trusted friends, family, and clergy and gave permission to family members to keep unwelcome or peripheral family, friends, and clergy at a distance. We supported a strategy to place trusted friends between themselves and what was at times an unintentionally unhelpful and intrusive community.\n\nOne young couple asked how these horrific events should be explained to a surviving brother or sister (the answer depended on the age of the child), and whether it was okay for children to watch the description of events on television (No). We emphasized that these young parents should provide as much reassurance ("we\'ll find a way to get through this together"), safety ("the bad man who did this will never hurt anyone else again"), routine (maintaining wake up and bedtimes, getting back to school as soon as possible) and honesty as possible.\n\nAnother father was disturbed by a friend\'s suggestion that seeing the open casket would help his young surviving child experience "closure." He did not feel comfortable allowing the child to witness this sight, but was afraid he might be thwarting a healthy grieving process. I was able to reassure him that such exposure was not a necessary for healing.\n\nWe informed survivors about the significant individual, gender, and cultural differences in how people mourn and encouraged them to tolerate each other\'s patterns and styles of mourning. We also reminded parents that grief could have a ripple effect. When parents are preoccupied with grief over a child, the surviving children can feel not only the loss of a sibling but abandoned by parents and grandparents. We therefore encouraged the parents to reach out to trusted friends, family and clergy and specifically ask them for help for themselves and surviving children\n\nI am a professor and clinician, a product of the secular humanist tradition. Yet Sandy Hook reinforced for me the centrality of discussions with clients about meaning, faith, spirituality, and religion. In the wake of tragedy and loss people need to talk about death and the afterlife. Disaster Mental Health professionals must be culturally competent to have these conversations, even while helping clients obtain spiritual support from clergy.\n\nFamily members told my colleagues and me that that evidence-informed early mental health intervention we offered -- emphasizing the promotion of safety, calm, social support, self-efficacy and hope -- was helpful to them. The United States has more than its share of disasters, some human-caused like Sandy Hook, some from natural causes like floods, hurricanes, tornadoes and wildfires. We need to assure that our crisis counselors are available and well trained when they are needed, as, sadly and surely, they always will be.\n\nJames Halpern is Professor of Psychology and Director of the Institute for Disaster Mental Health at SUNY New Paltz and author of Disaster Mental Health: Theory and Practice', 'title': 'Is Disaster Mental Health Helpful?

Sandy Hook school, please,” the woman said.\n\nOne caller told police in a trembling, breathless voice that a gunman was shooting inside the building.\n\n“Keep everybody calm, keep everybody down, get everybody away from windows, OK,” the dispatcher said.\n\nAn unidentified teacher called from a classroom to the left of the front entrance to report what sounded like gunshots in the hall. She said she was in the room with all her students and hadn’t yet locked the door.\n\nThe calls were posted on the town’s website under a court order after a lengthy effort by The Associated Press to have them released for review.\n\nNewtown parents launch anti-violence drive\n\nAnother woman, who was shot in the foot, reported that she was in a classroom with children and two other adults, but that there was no way to safely lock the door. The dispatcher told her to apply pressure to the wound.\n\nOne of the first calls came from a custodian, Rick Thorne, who said that a window at the front of the school was shattered and that he kept hearing shooting. While on the line with Thorne, the dispatcher told somebody off the call: “Get everyone you can going down there.”\n\nThorne remained on the phone for several minutes.\n\n“There’s still shooting going on, please!” the custodian pleaded to a Newtown 911 dispatcher as six or seven shots could be heard in the background. “Still, it’s still going on!”\n\nThe gunman, 20-year-old Adam Lanza, shot his way into the school the morning of Dec. 14 and killed 20 children and six educators with a semi-automatic rifle. He also killed his mother in their Newtown home before driving to the school.\n\nNewtown police officers arrived at the school within four minutes of the first 911 call, but nearly six minutes passed before they entered the building as they sorted out concerns over a possible second shooter, according to a prosecutor’s report issued last week.\n\nIt’s not clear whether the delay made a difference because Lanza killed himself one minute after the first officer arrived on the scene, according to the report.\n\nIn one of the recordings released Wednesday, dispatchers were heard making calls to Connecticut state police that apparently rang unanswered. One of the three unanswered calls rang for at least 50 seconds. State police picked up on a fourth call.\n\nBut state police had already been dispatched to the school by the time those calls were made, according to a timeline and call log supplied by Newtown officials.\n\nIn all, seven recordings of landline calls from inside the school to Newtown police were posted Wednesday. Calls that were routed to state police are the subject of a separate, pending freedom of information request by the AP.\n\nProsecutors opposed the tapes’ release, arguing among other things that the recordings could cause the victims’ families more anguish.\n\n“We all understand why some people have strong feelings about the release of these tapes. This was a horrible crime,” said Kathleen Carroll, AP executive editor and senior vice president. “It’s important to remember, though, that 911 tapes, like other police documents, are public records. Reviewing them is a part of normal newsgathering in a responsible news organization.”\n\nAs the town prepared to release the recordings, the superintendent of Newtown schools, John Reed, advised parents to consider limiting their families’ exposure to the media.\n\nOn the day of the shooting, the AP requested 911 calls and police reports, as it and other news organizations routinely do in their newsgathering.\n\nNewtown’s police department effectively ignored the AP’s request for months until the news cooperative appealed to the state’s Freedom of Information Commission, which said in September that the recordings should be released.\n\nThe prosecutor in charge of the Newtown investigation, State’s Attorney Stephen Sedensky III, had argued that releasing the tapes could cause pain for the victims’ families, hurt the investigation, subject witnesses to harassment and violate the rights of survivors who deserve special protection as victims of child abuse.\n\nA state judge dismissed those arguments last week and ordered the tapes be released Wednesday unless the state appealed.\n\n“Release of the audio recordings will also allow the public to consider and weigh what improvements, if any, should be made to law enforcement’s response to such incidents,” Superior Court Judge Eliot Prescott said.\n\n“Delaying the release of the audio recordings, particularly where the legal justification to keep them confidential is lacking, only serves to fuel speculation about and undermine confidence in our law enforcement officials.”', 'title': 'Sandy Hook massacre: 911 recordings document the horror', 'url': 'https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2013/12/04/newtown_school_shooting_recordings_of_911_calls_from_rampage_to_be_released_wednesday.html', 'keywords': ['sandy', 'recordings', 'state', 'shooting', 'massacre', 'newtown', 'calls', '911', 'release', 'horror', 'tapes', 'released', 'hook', 'school', 'document'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': '“There’s still shooting going on, please!” the custodian pleaded to a Newtown 911 dispatcher as six or seven shots could be heard in the background.\nIn one of the recordings released Wednesday, dispatchers were heard making calls to Connecticut state police that apparently rang unanswered.\nProsecutors opposed the tapes’ release, arguing among other things that the recordings could cause the victims’ families more anguish.\n“It’s important to remember, though, that 911 tapes, like other police documents, are public records.\nOn the day of the shooting, the AP requested 911 calls and police reports, as it and other news organizations routinely do in their newsgathering.', 'date': 1386115200}, {'text': 'By clicking “Agree,” you consent to Slate’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy and the use of technologies such as cookies by Slate and our partners to deliver relevant advertising on our site, in emails and across the Internet, to personalize content and perform site analytics.

The long delay was due to opposition by the state’s attorney Stephen Sedensky, who oversaw the investigation of the massacre and in the process became so concerned about the feelings of victims’ families that he lost sight of his legal obligations. Sedensky fell far short of showing that the 911 recordings qualified for any of the recognized exceptions to Connecticut’s Freedom of Information Act, which creates a presumption in favor of making public records public.\n\nThere are important reasons for that presumption, starting with the premise that government accountability requires transparency. As Superior Court Judge Eliot Prescott observed last week when he rejected Sedensky’s effort to keep the Sandy Hook calls under wraps, “release of the audio recordings will assist the public in gauging the appropriateness of law enforcement’s response.” The recordings also can help the public judge the propriety of legislative responses to the massacre, such as limits on the size of ammunition magazines. The sound of gunshots in the background of the calls is one piece of evidence concerning the pace at which Lanza fired his rifle, which illuminates the question of whether the seconds needed to switch magazines could have made an important difference in the deadliness of his assault.\n\n(MORE: 911 Dispatchers Reacted Calmly to Sandy Hook School Shooting)\n\nWe know from other highly publicized events that public access to primary materials like 911 audio can aid understanding, restoring nuances that may have been lost in translation by government agencies and news outlets. To pick one especially egregious example, NBC News last year edited the call that George Zimmerman made to police in Sanford, Fla., on the night he shot Trayvon Martin so that Zimmerman seemed to be citing the teenager’s race as a reason to be suspicious of him. The full recording, which was posted online when the case became a national story, made it clear that Zimmerman was merely responding to a question from the police dispatcher when he said Martin “looks black.” More generally, the recording of that call was important evidence in assessing the prosecution’s claim that Zimmerman shot Martin in anger rather than in self-defense.\n\nZimmerman’s postacquittal legal troubles also were illuminated by 911 audio, like the Nov. 18 call in which his girlfriend reported that he aimed a shotgun at her during a fight, which paints a more complicated picture than that bare-bones description suggests. The recording does not resolve whether she was telling the truth, but it does lend some credibility to a charge that figured prominently in Zimmerman’s murder trial: that he is an aggressor who is good at playing the victim.\n\nIt certainly is true that 911 recordings can be used for less edifying purposes as well: to titillate the public, for instance, or feed the passions that promote political panics. But so can every artifact or piece of evidence associated with a sensational crime, and we cannot have the good without the bad. Like Sedensky’s doomed effort to shield the families of Lanza’s victims from reminders of their loss, covering our ears will not make an ugly reality disappear, but paying close attention might make our response to it more rational.\n\nSullum is a senior editor at Reason, a nationally syndicated columnist and a drug-policy blogger at Forbes.\n\nMORE: There Is No Such Thing as a Motive for Mass Killings', 'title': 'Why It’s Important to Listen to the Sandy Hook 911 Tapes', 'url': 'http://ideas.time.com/2013/12/04/why-its-important-to-listen-to-the-sandy-hook-911-tapes/', 'keywords': ['sandy', 'listen', 'recordings', 'zimmerman', 'martin', 'victims', 'recording', '911', 'tapes', 'important', 'public', 'hook', 'school'], 'tags': {'Looking Forward', 'The Breakdown'}, 'summary': 'Sedensky fell far short of showing that the 911 recordings qualified for any of the recognized exceptions to Connecticut’s Freedom of Information Act, which creates a presumption in favor of making public records public.\nThere are important reasons for that presumption, starting with the premise that government accountability requires transparency.\n(MORE: 911 Dispatchers Reacted Calmly to Sandy Hook School Shooting)We know from other highly publicized events that public access to primary materials like 911 audio can aid understanding, restoring nuances that may have been lost in translation by government agencies and news outlets.\nIt certainly is true that 911 recordings can be used for less edifying purposes as well: to titillate the public, for instance, or feed the passions that promote political panics.\nSullum is a senior editor at Reason, a nationally syndicated columnist and a drug-policy blogger at Forbes.', 'date': 1386115200}, {'text': "Adam Lanza, who also murdered six staff members at Newtown’s Sandy Hook Elementary last December, took just five minutes to carry out his killing spree yet managed to fire 155 rounds into two classrooms, it emerged.\n\nNew details of the massacre, along with inventories of guns, knives, swords and other equipment recovered from the 20-year-old killer’s house, were made public on Thursday in search warrant reports that were unsealed by a judge in Connecticut.\n\nThe findings – including photographs of a corpse apparently covered in blood, and a newspaper cutting on a previous school massacre – offered the first official clues to Lanza’s mindset prior to his rampage.\n\nOne document disclosed that a friend interviewed by the FBI following the shootings had said that the school, which the gunman had himself attended as a young boy, was “Adam Lanza’s 'life’”.\n\nIt confirmed that friends also said he “rarely leaves home and considers himself to be a shut-in”, and that he was an “avid” player of Call Of Duty, the graphically violent military video game.\n\nThe home on Yogananda Street that Lanza shared with his mother, Nancy, was found to contain two rifles, at least nine knives, three Samurai swords, and some 1,600 rounds of ammunition.\n\nOfficers also found a gift-card from Mrs Lanza to her son that appeared to be for the purchase of another semi-automatic handgun.

Sedensky III of the judicial district of Danbury, which includes Newtown, stressed in his statement Thursday: "This is an active, ongoing investigation. No conclusions have been reached, and no final determinations have been made."\n\nAt the same time, he acknowledged that the public -- including those intent on preventing other such massacres -- has an understandable, sincere desire to have information now.\n\nThat\'s the mindset of Tim Makris, co-founder of Sandy Hook Promise, which supports "common sense solutions that make ... our country safer." Even with its limited scope, he called Thursday\'s document release a step forward.\n\n"The information revealed today underscores the need to turn this tragedy into transformation," Makris said.\n\nFresh insights into Lanza, his home\n\nAlthough the new documents don\'t provide a motive, they offer fresh glimpses into the life of 20-year-old Adam Lanza, in part by revealing what was inside the Newtown home he shared with his mother, Nancy.\n\nOne person, whose name was redacted in a search warrant, described Adam Lanza as a shut-in who rarely left home and played military-style video games.\n\nThat house included a gun locker that investigators found open and without signs of a break-in, Sedensky said. All the guns tied to Adam Lanza appeared to have been purchased by his mother, he added.\n\nPolice also found more than 1,600 rounds of unspent ammunition inside the home, according to the documents. Gov. Dannel Malloy pointed out Thursday the mass killer left lower-capacity magazines behind, a fact that, he said, speaks to the need to significantly restrict the number of bullets that can be in each magazine. He also said assault weapons should be banned.\n\nThe Newtown house also had three Samurai swords and several books -- one titled "NRA Guide to the Basics of Pistol Shooting," another about Asperger\'s syndrome and a third on autism -- the newly released documents show. Connecticut\'s chief medical examiner has said he had been told that Lanza had Asperger\'s syndrome . Research has not shown a link between violence and that condition, a high-functioning form of autism marked by social awkwardness.\n\nInvestigators also found a 2008 New York Times article about a shooting at Northern Illinois University that left six dead, including the gunman.\n\nThey also took three photographs "of what appears to be a deceased human covered with plastic and what appears to be blood," a receipt for a shooting range in Oklahoma and National Rifle Association certificates for Nancy and Adam Lanza. The NRA, a gun rights advocacy group, has issued a statement saying neither Lanza nor his mother were members.\n\nRetracing what happened December 14\n\nThe carnage began in that house.\n\nBefore embarking on his rampage at Sandy Hook, Adam Lanza killed his 52-year-old mother by shooting her in the forehead as she lay in bed, a search warrant states.\n\n"There was no indication of a struggle" between mother and son, Sedensky said.\n\nFrom there, he drove to the elementary school -- leaving a 12-gauge shotgun in the car, police would discover -- and shot through the front entrance.\n\nThe information detailed Thursday dispelled some earlier reports on what happened, Sedensky noted. Lanza wasn\'t wearing a bulletproof vest, for one. And besides the hallway, he fatally shot students and teachers in two classrooms, not three.\n\nWhen police found Lanza\'s body -- killed by a single, self-inflicted shot from a Glock 10 mm handgun -- they also discovered that the Bushmaster rifle was loaded with 14 bullets in its 30-round capacity magazine, plus one round in a chamber.\n\nThis was one of 10 of this firearm\'s 30-round capacity magazines at the scene, Sedensky explained. More ammunition for the Glock and a Sig Sauer P226 9 mm handgun was also found. Three such magazines still contained 30 rounds. There were six more magazines nearby -- three of them were empty, while the others had 10, 11 or 13 live rounds in them.\n\n"One-hundred-and-fifty-four spent .223 casings were recovered from the scene," the state\'s attorney wrote, indicating that Lanza had fired at least that many bullets from what Connecticut authorities had described as an "assault-type rifle."\n\nA lot of bullets fired in not a lot of time. Sedensky said, "It is currently estimated that the time from when the shooter shot his way into the school until he took his own life was less than five minutes."\n\nGun control push continues despite dwindling support\n\nThe full investigation into the Sandy Hook shooting, Sedensky said, likely will be completed this summer.\n\nAfter that happens, the state\'s attorney said he will write a report evaluating the crimes committed and whether or not anyone will be prosecuted as a result.\n\nUntil then, the debate over gun control stoked by the Sandy Hook massacre continues in earnest.\n\nRecent polling shows public support for gun restrictions has declined since the shooting. Shortly after it, 52% of Americans favored major restrictions on guns, according to a CNN/ORC International poll. That number has dwindled to 43%, a version of the same poll conducted between March 15 and 17 found.\n\nNo legislation on the matter has passed yet in Washington, though gun control advocates are pushing.\n\nMayors Against Illegal Guns on Thursday released its first television ad featuring relatives of Newtown victims urging politicians to pass tougher gun laws. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the group\'s co-founder, said in a statement: "We cannot afford to wait for another tragedy. It\'s long past time for elected officials to listen to their constituents and pass reforms like comprehensive background checks that we know will save lives."\n\nPresident Barack Obama voiced a similar sentiment in remarks Thursday as part of a "national day of action" to galvanize supporters pushing for tougher gun laws.\n\n"This is our best chance in more than a decade to take common sense steps that will save lives," he said at a White House event. "If there is a step we can take that will save just one child, just one parent, just another town from experiencing the same grief that some of the moms and dads who are here have endured, then we should be doing it.

The answer, the NRA said, is no. The lobbying organization made the statement after it was revealed that police had discovered NRA certificates among Lanza\'s possessions.\n\nIn a sharply worded statement, the NRA said, "There is no record of a member relationship between Newtown killer Adam Lanza, nor between Nancy Lanza, A. Lanza or N. Lanza with the National Rifle Association. Reporting to the contrary is reckless, false and defamatory."\n\nThe statement came in response to the release Thursday of search warrants from the home of Adam Lanza, the man responsible for the shooting deaths of 26 people in December at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.\n\nIn addition to discovering a large cache of weapons, ammunition, and documents, authorities recovered a pistol shooting guide produced by the NRA among Lanza\'s things, as well as certificates issued by the NRA to both Adam Lanza and his mother.\n\nThe discovery quickly led some to assume the Lanzas must have been NRA members, or that the NRA\'s statement that they were not members was equal to the NRA challenging the integrity of the police report.\n\nNeither of these is the case, however. The NRA certificates the police found in the house likely had nothing to do with formal NRA membership -- they were possibly awarded for completion of training and safety courses that had been certified by the NRA, the nation\'s largest gun safety training organization. According to its website, the NRA doesn\'t offer formal certificates for membership.\n\nNRA training courses are taught by a network of more than 5,000 firing range instructors across the country, and they are available to anyone, even if that person is not an NRA member. Nancy Lanza was described by friends as a "gun enthusiast" who liked to bring her son with her to the gun range -- it\'s possible she and Adam Lanza secured NRA certificates at a gun range for completing a course offered by the organization, without being members.\n\nIn 2012, the NRA sent out more than 200,000 training packets to a wide range of shooting sports participants, including certified firearms instructors, firing range operators, and local rifle and pistol clubs nationwide.

Vice President Joe Biden will hold a gun-related event at the White House on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, first lady Michelle Obama travels to Chicago for another gun event.\n\nBut most unusual, perhaps, is the fact that 11 family members of Sandy Hook victims will accompany the president on Air Force One back to Washington after his speech at the University of Hartford. The family members will head to Capitol Hill to lobby members of Congress on gun legislation.\n\nAt his daily briefing, White House press secretary Jay Carney portrayed the Air Force One news as a matter of logistics.\n\n“These are family members who are planning to be in Washington to speak with Congress about the importance of taking action to reduce gun violence,” Mr. Carney said, “and in order to make sure they were able to attend the event in Connecticut and still be in Washington when they needed to be, we invited those family members to fly back with the president.”\n\nObama frequently surrounds himself with stakeholders – be they middle-class taxpayers, law enforcement, or supporters of health-care reform – when making public remarks. But having them hitch a ride on Air Force One to get them to D.C. for a lobbying push is rare. The move no doubt reflects the depth of Obama’s emotion on gun violence, and on the Sandy Hook massacre in particular, in which 20 first-graders were murdered by a lone gunman. The day of the massacre, the president brushed away tears and could barely speak when he addressed the tragedy in public for the first time.\n\nProspects for new gun-related measures had grown increasingly dim in recent weeks, amid a threatened filibuster that now includes 13 Republican senators. But on Sunday, a new bipartisan effort on background checks emerged involving Sens. Patrick Toomey (R) of Pennsylvania and Joe Manchin (D) of West Virginia. According to The Washington Post, the two men are working out a compromise that would require background checks for all gun purchases except sales between close family members and some hunters.\n\nPolls show sky-high support for “universal background checks” – still close to 90 percent, four months after Sandy Hook. But Democrats have been stymied in their effort to round up the 60 votes needed to halt a filibuster in the Senate.\n\nOn Monday, as the Senate reconvened after a two-week recess, majority leader Harry Reid (D) of Nevada made an emotional plea to allow votes about measures under discussion, including background checks and school-safety funds.\n\n“There are strong feelings and deep disagreements about some of these measures, but every one of these measures deserves a vote, a yes or no. No hiding, no running from an issue that has captivated America,” Senator Reid said.\n\nThe emotional buildup to this week’s focus on guns began Sunday night, as CBS’s “60 Minutes” featured the families of seven Sandy Hook victims. They were all members of the group Sandy Hook Promise, which successfully lobbied the Connecticut legislature to pass what advocates call the strictest gun control legislation in the nation. The law adds more than 100 guns to the state’s assault weapons ban, bars the purchase or sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines, and requires background checks for all gun buyers.\n\nOn “60 Minutes,” family members spoke of their lobbying effort, including why they showed lawmakers pictures of the children who had died.\n\n“They need to not just look us in the eyes, but look at our children, and the lost ones and … and see those faces, see what’s gone, and remember this isn’t just about political parties, this isn’t just about careers,” said Nicole Hockley, whose 6-year-old son Dylan was slain. “This is about people.”\n\nMs. Hockley will introduce Obama at Monday’s event at the University of Hartford.\n\nFollow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.\n\nBut not all parents of Sandy Hook victims are with the president on gun control. Last week, at a National Rifle Association event unveiling a task force proposal on school safety recommendations – including training school personnel to carry weapons at school – a victim’s father praised the NRA effort.\n\n"I wanted to take a minute and applaud ... the NRA for coming up and spending the time and resources on putting a program like this together," said Mark Mattioli, whose 6-year-old son, James, was killed in the December shooting.

Her twin brother, Noah, was in a classroom down the hall.\n\nNoah Pozner was killed by Lanza, along with 19 other children at the school, and six adults. Arielle and other students\' siblings survived.\n\n"That\'s going to be incredibly difficult to cope with," said Dr. Jamie Howard, a clinical psychologist at the Child Mind Institute in New York. "It is not something we expect her to cope with today and be OK with tomorrow."\n\nREAD: Two Adult Survivors of Connecticut School Shooting Will be Key Witnesses\n\nAs the community of Newtown, Conn., begins to bury the young victims of the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting today, the equally young siblings of those killed will only be starting to comprehend what happened to their brothers and sisters.\n\n"Children this young do experience depression in a diagnosable way, they do experience post-traumatic stress disorder. Just because they\'re young, they don\'t escape the potential for real suffering," said Rahil Briggs, a child psychologist and professor at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City.\n\nArielle and other survivor siblings could develop anxiety or other emotional reactions to their siblings\' death, including "associative logic," where they associate their own actions with their sibling\'s death, Howard said.\n\n"This is when two things happen, and (children) infer that one thing caused the other. (Arielle) may be at risk for that type of magical thinking, and that could be where survivor\'s guilt comes in. She may think she did something, but of course she didn\'t," Howard said.\n\nCLICK HERE for photos from the shooting scene.\n\nChildren in families where one sibling has died sometimes struggle as their parents are overwhelmed by grief, Howard noted. When that death is traumatic, adults and children sometimes choose not to think about the person or the event to avoid pain.\n\nInterested in How to Help Newtown Families?\n\n"With traumatic grief, it\'s really important to talk about and think about the children that died, not to avoid talking and thinking about them because that interferes with grieving process, want their lives to be celebrated," Howard said.\n\nChildren may also have difficulty understanding why their deceased brother or sister is receiving so much, or so little, attention, according Briggs.\n\n"I think one of the most challenging questions we can be faced with as parents is how to \'appropriately\' remember a child that is gone. So much that can go wrong with that," Briggs said. "You have the child who is fortunate enough to escape, who thinks \'Why me? Why did my brother go?\' But if you don\'t remember the sibling enough the child says \'it seems like we\'ve forgotten my brother.\'"\n\n"They may even find themselves feeling jealous of all the attention the sibling seems to be receiving," Briggs said.\n\nParents and other adults in the family\'s support system need to be on alert, watching the child\'s behavior, she said. Children could show signs of withdrawing, or seeming spacy or in a daze. They could also seem jumpy or have difficulty concentrating in the wake of a traumatic event.\n\n"For kids experiencing symptoms, and interfering with ability to go to school, they may be suffering from acute stress disorder, and there are good treatments," Howard said.\n\n"The more directly affected you are by a trauma and perceive it as scary -- like you almost died -- the harder time you have. They\'ll associate school with the shooting. It will be challenging and they will need support, but we do want to confront the things associated with the trauma, that\'s how we get over it," she said.\n\nIt will be vital in the next weeks for parents of surviving siblings to return the surviving child to a normal routine, including regular meals, sleeping, and physical habits, Howard and Briggs said.\n\n"They need to make sure she\'s doing well in school and able to make and keep her friends, and then move on to celebrating (Noah\'s) life, and trying to find a way to honor him. This is going to shift as we get further away from the actual day of this horrible thing," Howard said.\n\n"Children may demonstrate pretty severe bouts of anxiety, or clinginess, or reluctance to go to school when it reopens, or separate from their parents," Briggs said. "They may be more irritable, are crying more often, are more difficult to soothe. You\'ll see other children who experience a few days of disruption but very much get back into rhythm of life, the routine of life, which is very important for parents to keep up."\n\nBriggs and Howard both noted that parents must try to create a stable environment for the child, and make them feel safe, even if the parents are dealing with trauma, too.\n\n"It\'s time to call in all the reinforcements you have. Accept all those offers of help that get dismissed so often. If there\'s a grandparent, aunt and uncle, or sibling to come in relieve you from your primary duties, it is far better to bring in a beloved family member than it is to crack when undergoing such stress," Briggs said.\n\n"You don\'t want to lie to child and say everything\'s fine, but it is really overwhelming to a child if you are sobbing daily and unable to keep thehome running. That sends them a message more than anything else that something is really wrong here," Briggs said.\n\nIf a child\'s appetite or sleeping habits change, or if they show any regressive behaviors, including wetting the bed or trouble separating from their parents, it may time to seek professional help, experts said.\n\nChild pscyhologists, counselors, teachers, therapists, and clergy are all specially-trained professionals who can help deal with grief, and talking about the tragedy in a calm and supportive way will help the child most, Briggs said.\n\n"The best thing to do in general is try to keep the routines of the family as consistent as possible, and try to convey the ability to keep them safe and confident in that, so you do not seem as anxious and distraught over it as you probably are," Briggs said.

Ironically, that includes $1.845 million spent on lobbying expenditures by the parent group and $360,000 by the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, which identifies itself as the "lobbying arm of the NRA." This money went to promoting bills like S. 570, which would stop the government from tracking purchases of multiple rifles, and to condemning a piece of legislation introduced in the wake of the Aurora, Colo., theater shooting that would have essentially banned online ammunition sales. That bill never made it to a vote.\n\n$13,130,902.38\n\nThe NRA\'s PAC, National Rifle Association of America Political Victory Fund, started out 2012 with about five-and-a-quarter million dollars in their pockets. By the end of November, they had less than $1.5 million. So they spent about $4 million, right? Wrong. The NRA-PVF was taking in money during the election year; according to a post-election FEC report, they spent more than $13 million from the start of the year until Dec. 6.\n\nThey graded candidates on a modified A through F scale. The NRA gave Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., an F rating, despite his rank as Indiana\'s longest-serving senator in history.\n\nThe group said that during Lugar\'s 36 years in Congress, he had moved "away from our shared values."\n\n"He claimed to be a strong supporter of our rights when he first came to Washington. Now, he votes for gun bans," read a release titled "Hoosiers Defend Freedom" on the NRA-PVF website.\n\nSome argue NRA members no longer get as much bang for their buck when it comes to influencing elections, but Lugar lost the primary election to Indiana State Treasurer Richard Mourdock.\n\n$59.95\n\nThe cost of a Daisy Model 1938 Red Ryder BB Gun Kit at the NRA store, proceeds from which "go directly to support vital NRA programs," according to the store\'s website.\n\nSen.

On MSNBC Monday, Manchin said he was "a proud member," but that the tragedy had changed him.\n\n"We can protect the Second Amendment rights," Manchin said.

The website on which his post appeared is not affiliated with FAU in any way,' school spokesman Lisa Metcalf said to the Sun Sentinel.\n\nThough his ultimate end goal is unclear, he says that the end goal of the 'supposed' shooting was political in nature.\n\nThe moment he heard: Mr Tracy believes that there were government forces at work in the shooting at Sandy Hook, and theoretically then this may not be the moment President Obama was told\n\nPredictably, his statements have sparked outrage from people across the country and not just in the still-grieving Connecticut town where much of the last three weeks has been spent picking up the pieces.\n\n\n\n'Is there something in the water in Florida that makes for idiocy,' commented Ray Gillies on the story by the local ABC affiliate WPBF.\n\n\n\n'How dare you suggest this was a hoax and entertain that this didn't happen,' said a Sun Sentinel reader with the username JimNasium1.\n\n\n\n'I'm afraid that you do not seem to be worthy of the teaching credentials that you hold and were any of my kids students of yours, I'd withdraw them from your roster within the hour.You are NOT good at what you do and you suck as a human being.'\n\nPolitical ends: He argues that the shooting was enabled in order to speed up legislation against guns\n\nInstead, he is speaking plenty for himself and other believers by posting repeatedly on his blog, memoryholeblog.com , and appearing on talk radio shows to promote the theory.\n\n'As documents relating to the Sandy Hook shooting continue to be assessed and interpreted by independent researchers, there is a growing awareness that the media coverage of the massacre of 26 children and adults was intended primarily for public consumption to further larger political ends,' he wrote.\n\nHe argues that Senator Dianne Feinstein was already in the midst of trying to rework the assault weapons ban that she co-sponsored back in the 1990s, and that the shooting gave her leverage to move it through the legislative process quicker.\n\n", 'title': 'Newtown shooting: Conspiracy theory professor says Sandy Hook shooting may not have happened', 'url': 'http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2259104/Newtown-shooting-Conspiracy-theory-professor-says-Sandy-Hook-shooting-happened.html', 'keywords': ['shooting', 'sandy', 'theory', 'newtown', 'happened', 'florida', 'way', 'media', 'conspiracy', 'hook', 'tracy', 'professor'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': "'While it sounds like an outrageous claim, one is left to inquire whether the Sandy Hook shooting ever took place -- at least in the way law enforcement authorities and the nation's news media have described,' he has said.\nThe 47-year-old professor bases his outrageous claims largely on the flurry of conflicting media reports that were made as news of the shooting was released throughout the day on December 14.\nMr Tracy has written a number of book chapters about media coverage of wars, economic overhauls and union negotiations.\nThough his ultimate end goal is unclear, he says that the end goal of the 'supposed' shooting was political in nature.\n'As documents relating to the Sandy Hook shooting continue to be assessed and interpreted by independent researchers, there is a growing awareness that the media coverage of the massacre of 26 children and adults was intended primarily for public consumption to further larger political ends,' he wrote.", 'date': 1357664252}, {'text': 'Get daily news updates directly to your inbox Subscribe See our privacy notice Thank you for subscribing!

Nouel Alba, 37, pleaded guilty in June to federal charges of wire fraud and making false statements. Beginning on the day of the shootings last December, prosecutors said, Alba used Facebook, emails, text messages and telephone calls to falsely claim to be the aunt of six-year-old Noah Pozner. Authorities said she told people she was collecting donations for a funeral fund on behalf of Noah's family and the families of other victims of the shooting. Alba's sentencing followed an emotional victim impact statement given in court by Mark Mattioli, father of six-year-old victim James Mattioli. Speaking at times through tears, Mattioli asked U.S. District Court Judge Michael P. Shea to impose a sentence of 26 months, one for each of the Newtown school victims. 'Her actions were anything but gentle,' Mattioli said. 'They were immediate, intrusive, exploitative, disgusting, and they added to my feeling of victimisation.' Prosecutors acknowledged that Alba collected only about $240 through her efforts and repaid it.\n\nBut special assistant U.S. attorney Jonathan Francis argued for prison time, saying Alba's actions had caused emotional harm to the community and created a chilling effect on charitable giving. Alba used Facebook, emails, text messages and telephone calls to claim to be the victim's aunt 'It's a callous, calculating attempt to profit off the murder of children,' he said. Mattioli contrasted Alba's fraud and the actions of a man who had delivered food to his front door in the days after the shooting and asked for nothing in return. Six-year-old Noah Pozner was shot dead by Adam Lanza in his school last year 'He chose love; she chose evil,' he said. Defense attorneys had argued in their sentencing memorandum for probation, saying Alba had suffered enough at the hands of the media as 'something of a stand-in for the actual perpetrator of the Sandy Hook massacre.' Alba has been hounded by the press, has lost her friends, has been unable to maintain a steady job and is facing foreclosure on her home, they said. Alba declined to speak at the hearing. Defense attorney Gary Weinberger compared her to a Colonial-era criminal put in the stocks to have fruit thrown at her. 'She was and has been made into an incredible pariah,' he said. The judge said he took into account Alba's position as a single mother of two children, including one with autism, when passing sentence.\n\nHe said he wanted to make it clear she was not being punished as a proxy for the shooter. He said a prison sentence was necessary because of the psychological damage inflicted by Alba's actions and to deter others from committing similar frauds. 'The attempt to profit from a national tragedy,' he said, 'was outrageous'.\n\nVictims: Top row- (L-R) Ana Marquez-Greene, Caroline Previdi, Jessica Rekos, Emilie Parker, Noah Pozner.

Plans to erect a new school on the exact same spot have been welcomed by some parents in the town as a powerful statement that the community has not been broken by the tragedy.\n\n"I think our message should be at that site that love can win over fear," said Steve Uhde, whose son is a Sandy Hook second-grader. Another Sandy Hook parent, Peter Barresi, said he was worried that if a new school were to be built at a different location: "We didn\'t just lose 20 children and six adults, we\'re letting him [the gunman, Adam Lanza] take the building too." Barresi\'s son attends the first grade and was on the other side of the school from where the shootings happened.\n\nThe vote was taken on Friday night by a task force of 28 local elected officials, called the Sandy Hook School Building Task Force. The result was unanimous and will now go to the local school board. It will ultimately have to be approved by residents at a referendum. The panel\'s recommendation pleased Daniel Krauss, whose daughter is a second-grader.\n\n"It\'s been a place for learning, for kids to grow up and it\'s going to go back to that," he said, after attending the meeting at the Newtown Municipal Center.\n\nThe 430 surviving students are now attending a renovated school, renamed Sandy Hook Elementary School, in the neighboring town of Monroe. They are expected to remain there until a new school is built in Newtown. The task force had narrowed a list of choices to renovating or rebuilding on the school site or building a new school on property down the street. A study found that building a new school on the existing site would cost $57m. If all goes well, officials said construction could begin in the spring of next year and the new building could open in January 2016.\n\nPlans under consideration call for a building with a shape that resembles homes and barns built in the town in the 1700s and 1800s and 26 glass cupolas on the roof with spires "pointed towards heaven", in remembrance of the 26 victims, according to a report compiled for the task force.\n\nSandy Hook Elementary School has not housed students since the killings. Some town residents said the school should be torn down, because they couldn\'t imagine sending children back there. Others favored renovating the school, with some saying that tearing it down would be a victory for evil.\n\nLast week, several teachers told the task force that they didn\'t want to return to the property. Brian Engel, whose six-year-old daughter, Olivia, died in the 14 December shootings, also told the task force last week that he didn\'t want Olivia\'s younger brother to attend school in the place where she died.\n\nLaura Roche, a member of the Sandy Hook School Task Force and vice-chairwoman of the local Board of Education, said it had been "very emotional and very hard" to come to a decision about the school\'s future. But she was pleased by the unanimous vote, a signal the panel was united. "We came together as 28, and I hope we can come together as a community to rebuild the spirit of our community and build the school together," she said.\n\nSeveral parents said it was important that children return to a school in the Sandy Hook village of Newtown as soon as possible. Residents of towns where other mass school shootings occurred have grappled with the same dilemma. Some have renovated, some have demolished.\n\nColumbine High School in Colorado, where two student gunmen killed 12 schoolmates and a teacher in 1999, reopened several months afterwards. Crews removed the library, where most of the victims died, and replaced it with an atrium. Virginia Tech converted a classroom building where a student gunman killed 32 people and himself in 2007 into a peace studies and violence prevention center. An Amish community in Pennsylvania tore down the West Nickel Mines Amish School and built a new school a few hundred yards away, after a gunman killed five girls there in 2006.\n\nOn the morning of 14 December, Adam Lanza, who had killed his mother at their Newtown home, went to Sandy Hook Elementary School and opened fire with an assault rifle. He killed himself as police arrived at the school.\n\nThe school shooting, one of the deadliest in US history, has spurred national debate about gun control and Second Amendment rights.\n\nThis article originally appeared on guardian.co.uk', 'title': 'Sandy Hook Elementary School To Be Torn Down And Rebuilt', 'url': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/sandy-hook-school-torn-down-rebuilt-2013-5', 'keywords': ['sandy', 'force', 'site', 'town', 'rebuilt', 'torn', 'killed', 'task', 'hook', 'school', 'elementary', 'building'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Sandy Hook Elementary Sandy Hook Elementary School A panel of local officials has voted unanimously to tear down Sandy Hook elementary school - the site of a school shooting in which 20 children and six educators were killed - but rebuild on the site.\nThe vote was taken on Friday night by a task force of 28 local elected officials, called the Sandy Hook School Building Task Force.\nThe 430 surviving students are now attending a renovated school, renamed Sandy Hook Elementary School, in the neighboring town of Monroe.\nSandy Hook Elementary School has not housed students since the killings.\nOn the morning of 14 December, Adam Lanza, who had killed his mother at their Newtown home, went to Sandy Hook Elementary School and opened fire with an assault rifle.', 'date': 1368230400}, {'text': 'They were the worst 15 minutes in state history, but what lessons have police learned about how to respond to an active shooter since the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary on Dec. 14, 2012? Troubleshooter George Colli investigates. (Published Tuesday, Aug. 27, 2013)\n\nIn the wake of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary, keeping children safe in school has become top priority. Who should have access to which guns? How should we address mental health issues?\n\nThese issues have been discussed at length since the morning that Adam Lanza shot his way into the school, killing 20 children and six educators.\n\nLost in the debate is police protocol. What have police learned and shared with their colleagues so police departments around our state can be better prepared?\n\nFew details have emerged about the Newtown police response on Dec. 14, particularly the first 15 minutes after the initial 911call around 9:36 a.m.\n\nMuch of the timeline remains unclear – even to the first responders who rushed to the scene.\n\nThe Initial Call\n\n9:35:52 a.m. “6-7 Sandy Hook School. Caller\'s indicating she thinks there\'s someone\'s shooting in the building.”\n\n9:36:38 a.m. “The front glass has been broken in front of the school. They’re unsure why.”\n\n9:37:16 a.m. “Individual that I have on the phone is continuing to hear what he believes to be gunshots.”\n\nThe front door is shattered and shots are fired inside.\n\nThat’s all the first responding Newtown police officers know as they pull into the Sandy Hook Elementary School parking lot on Dec. 14, 2012.\n\nThe first swarm of officers arrive at the scene within two minutes of the initial call.\n\nAfter reviewing policies twice a year and last training in 2011, Newtown Police Chief Michael Kehoe and the other first responders know the protocol: get to the aggressor and stop the shooting as quickly as possible.\n\n“Rapid response and then, you know, in a coordinated effort, as much as you can, go in and find a threat ... actually bypassing victims until you find a threat, until you know the threat is no longer hurting people,” Kehoe said.\n\nWith very little information available and hundreds of children and teachers in harm\'s way, there’s much for police to consider.\n\nHow many shooters? Are there explosives at the entrances? What kind of weapons are being used?\n\n“We recognize that our active-shooter training protocols give you a base to follow. We know that you can’t follow to a tee because you can\'t say that every incident is going to look the same,” said Kehoe, who was at the scene within minutes of the first call. “Many things come in play with an active shooter response.”\n\nPolice Arrive at the Scene: 2 Minutes After the Initial Call\n\n9:38:15 a.m. “The shooting appears to have stopped. It is silent at this time. The school is in lockdown.”\n\n9.39.03 a.m. "Reports that the teacher saw two shadows running past the building, past the gym.”\n\n9:39:20 a.m. “Yeah, we got \'em. They’re coming at me.”\n\nMultiple Shooters? 4-5 Minutes After the Initial Call\n\nPolice will still not confirm who those shadows belong to, but a man who asked to remain anonymous said he was handcuffed and briefly questioned that morning.\n\nThe father of a first-grader said he was supposed to build gingerbread houses with his daughter\'s class at 9:45 a.m. He arrived 10 minutes early and said he was 50 feet from the entrance when he heard gunshots.\n\nWhile calling 911, he ran to the back of the school to look for his daughter, then approached police near the playground area and identified himself.\n\nAt this point, nearly five minutes had passed since the initial call was placed. Gunshots again ring out inside.\n\n9:40:27 a.m. “The shooter is apparently still shooting in the office area. 12 Dickenson Drive.”\n\n9.42.17 a.m. “Last known shots were in the front of the school.”\n\nEngaging the Gunman – 8 Minutes After the Initial Call\n\nWith the shooting now stopped, two teams of Newtown police enter the school. Chief Kehoe\'s team tries to get inside a back door and another team goes in through the boiler room.\n\nThe school is still in lockdown, so getting inside is a challenge. The group around back is forced to break a window.\n\nA source familiar with the investigation said that around this time, two state troopers from nearby Troop A in Southbury arrive and immediately enter through the shattered front entrance. Closing in on the gunman, they soon come across his path of terror.\n\n9:45:48 a.m. “We’ve got bodies here.”\n\n9:46:20 a.m. “We’ve got an injured person in room number 9 with numerous gunshot wounds.”\n\n9.46.50 a.m. “We have a sergeant from Newtown on scene. Unknown if the shooter is located.”\n\n9:49:05 a.m. “Negative on description. OK, shots were fired about three minutes ago.”\n\nGunman Found Dead – 15 Minutes After the Initial Call\n\nFifteen minutes after the first report of shots fired, the shooter is found dead in one of the classrooms.\n\n9:51:48 a.m. “We have a suspect down.”\n\n9:53:22 a.m. “Newtown\'s reporting one suspect down. The building has not been cleared.”\n\nAnd the horrifying reality of the worst 15 minutes in state history begins to set in as first responders turn their attention to the victims and evacuating the rest of the school.\n\n10:00:53 a.m. “Send the ambulances right away. Send them up to me.”\n\n10:01:46 a.m. “You might wanna see if the surrounding towns can send EMS personnel. We’re running out real quick, real fast.”\n\nThe Protocol\n\nUniversity of New Haven lecturer and former FBI agent Kenneth Gray founded the state\'s joint counter-terrorism task force and served as the bureau’s crisis management response coordinator out of New Haven, dealing with large-scale SWAT situations and high-profile arrests.\n\nHe said time is of the essence in active-shooter responses because the average incident lasts 12 minutes, and one in three incidents ends in less than half that time.\n\n“Since the situation is so fluid and developing so rapidly that you don’t have time to wait for a SWAT team,” said Gray, who retired from the bureau in 2009, “you have to use the resources you have available and have to put together a game plan to respond to this fluid situation.”\n\nFor decades, the protocol across all agencies was to call in a SWAT team and attempt to negotiate with the gunman. That started in 1966 when a gunman opened fire from a tower on the University of Texas campus.\n\nThen came the shooting at Columbine High School and everything changed.\n\nThat’s when two students killed 12 classmates and one teacher while police SWAT teams were standing outside the door for hours.\n\nState police spokesperson Lt. J. Paul Vance said the state police developed an active-shooter response protocol in 2006 based on the lessons learned from Columbine and dozens of other active shootings.\n\n“We’ve learned from many tragedies that have occurred that initial response needs to be immediate,” said Vance.\n\nSo what lessons have been passed on from the initial response in Newtown on Dec. 14?\n\nMore than eight months later, few of those lessons have been publicly revealed as police wait for the completion of the States Attorney’s investigation.\n\nIn January, the States Attorney’s office indicated that they hoped to have their report completed by June. Then in May, the goal changed to September. Now, it\'s sometime this fall.\n\nNewtown and state police have traveled the country to share what they’ve learned from that day – like managing victims\' families and how to best police a town in the days and weeks following such a tragedy.\n\nHowever, Chief Kehoe said even he does not know the specific details of what happened during his department\'s initial response.\n\n“We’re still gonna wait for that and develop that timeline scenarios of what everybody did at some point in time,” said Kehoe, who has made several trips to law enforcement conferences around the country. “I’m sure that we’ll make some changes along the way once we get those details. We’ll look at ourselves, look at our response, see if we can improve upon it."\n\nNewtown police are not the only first responders waiting for those details and an after-action review. Also waiting are officers from around the state.\n\nEric Brown, general counsel for AFCSME Council 15, the union that represents 4,000 police officers statewide, including those in Newtown, said in a statement:\n\n“We’re disappointed that the process has been so slow. We’re hoping the state puts more resources into the investigation now and will be completed in a timely manner.”\n\nNo matter what they find, Chief Kehoe said his department performed admirably that morning.\n\n“I’m very, very comfortable with our response. I’m very proud of the officers that were there first. They had a multitude of things to think about there and we then did what we needed to do to enter that school,” Kehoe said.\n\nThe States Attorney’s office would not comment on the pace or the details of the investigation. Neither would state police.\n\nLead investigators for the state police have canceled recent out-of-state speaking engagements.\n\nThe governor’s office is requesting that police be “more deliberative” as to which conferences they attend while the investigation is ongoing.', 'title': 'Sandy Hook: The First 15 Minutes', 'url': 'https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/investigations/Sandy-Hook-The-First-15-Minutes-221260161.html', 'keywords': ['sandy', 'minutes', 'state', 'shooting', 'response', 'know', 'newtown', '15', 'shooter', 'kehoe', 'hook', 'school', 'initial'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'They were the worst 15 minutes in state history, but what lessons have police learned about how to respond to an active shooter since the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary on Dec. 14, 2012?\n(Published Tuesday, Aug. 27, 2013)In the wake of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary, keeping children safe in school has become top priority.\nThat’s all the first responding Newtown police officers know as they pull into the Sandy Hook Elementary School parking lot on Dec. 14, 2012.\nOK, shots were fired about three minutes ago.”Gunman Found Dead – 15 Minutes After the Initial CallFifteen minutes after the first report of shots fired, the shooter is found dead in one of the classrooms.\n“We’ve learned from many tragedies that have occurred that initial response needs to be immediate,” said Vance.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'SANDY HOOK — Sandy Hook is back.\n\nThe popular park in Monmouth County finally reopened early this morning following six months of shoveling through sand and debris that Hurricane Sandy dumped there.\n\nMuch of the seven-mile park, part of the two-state Gateway National Recreation Area, is again open to the public, from fishing spots to parking lots to walking trails.\n\nEven its six public beaches are available to fishermen and for daytime strolls, though they won’t be open to swimmers for weeks.\n\nMost of the roads have been cleared, all but one parking lot restored, and the campground is up and running. Students from Cedar Creek Elementary School in Lanoka Harbor are taking a field trip the park today.\n\nNot bad, when months ago it seemed unlikely Sandy Hook would even open this year.\n\n“We’re a work in progress,” assistant park superintendent Pete McCarthy said during a tour of the park yesterday. “Considering that six months ago this road (Hartshorne Drive, the park’s main road) was absolutely impassable for five days … we’re in remarkably good shape.”\n\nThe park, which draws more than 2 million visitors a year, opened at 5 a.m. today, and is expected to draw twice as many visitors as usual. “I’m sure at 5 a.m. we will have a nice line of fishermen looking to get access here,” McCarthy said.\n\nAmong the biggest changes are the new operating hours: The park now closes at 8 p.m., not 10 p.m., McCarthy said.\n\nThe return seemed nearly impossible late last year. A tidal surge of more than 13 feet clobbered the narrow peninsula during Sandy and left the park coated with sand and debris.\n\nFlood waters of up to 6 feet submerged Sandy Hook’s fire station, ranger station, theater and most of its six concession stands. Three of Sandy Hook’s major parking lots were hidden beneath 3 to 4 feet of sand, McCarthy said.\n\n“I was worried it wouldn’t reopen,” said Mike Woodbury, owner of the Bay Avenue Bakery and Café in Highlands, whose restaurant normally sees a 25 percent bump in business from Sandy Hook visitors. “It brings everyone from Jersey. It’s a destination place.”\n\nCONNECT WITH US\n\n\n\nOn mobile or desktop: • Like The Star-Ledger on Facebook • Follow @starledger on Twitter And check out our redesigned mobile site by visiting NJ.com from any mobile browser.\n\nCleaning up Sandy Hook has been no simple task. Weeks after the hurricane, water and sand were still being pumped out of the sewage stations.\n\nPark officials were also concerned that unexploded ordnance left from the park’s former life as an Army ammunition testing ground may have surfaced during the storm. Two pieces of ordnance were found during the cleanup, McCarthy said.\n\nMajor improvements to the park’s sewage treatment plant are still needed, he said. Ground-level mechanical systems at the facility, he said, must be elevated to at least the height recommended by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is 14 feet above ground.\n\nAnd several buildings in the park, such as the visitors’ center, are still unusable. A new center has been set up at the Sandy Hook lighthouse, which somehow escaped any damage during Sandy.\n\nFor the most part, Sandy Hook is ready for the public. But be prepared to see lingering signs of Sandy’s fury.\n\nBeach facilities are still boarded up, including the Sea Gull’s Nest restaurant in the Area D beach. Buildings at Beach B, North Beach and the clothing-optional Gunnison Beach should be back by Memorial Day weekend, McCarthy said, while facilities at beaches C, D and E won’t open until July.\n\nThe popular Wednesday concerts on the beach will return June 12 to Area E, where a new stage has been erected.\n\nBeach parking will be free until Memorial Day weekend, when it jumps to $15 per day.\n\nMcCarthy said swimmers can use the beaches starting Memorial Day weekend. In the meantime, the beaches will be served by portable restrooms and temporary facilities, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n• Despite $35M in Hurricane Sandy damage, portions of Sandy Hook to re-open May 1\n\n• Hurricane-damaged Sandy Hook set to reopen this spring\n\n', 'title': 'Hurricane-battered Sandy Hook opens today', 'url': 'https://www.nj.com/monmouth/index.ssf/2013/05/sandy_hook_reopens_today_six_months_after_sandy.html', 'keywords': ['sandy', 'mccarthy', 'parking', 'hurricanebattered', 'beach', 'feet', 'park', 'sand', 'today', 'open', 'hook', 'visitors', 'opens'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'SANDY HOOK — Sandy Hook is back.\nNot bad, when months ago it seemed unlikely Sandy Hook would even open this year.\nA new center has been set up at the Sandy Hook lighthouse, which somehow escaped any damage during Sandy.\nFor the most part, Sandy Hook is ready for the public.\nRELATED COVERAGE• Despite $35M in Hurricane Sandy damage, portions of Sandy Hook to re-open May 1• Hurricane-damaged Sandy Hook set to reopen this spring', 'date': 1367391600}, {'text': "He said that demolition workers prepared other parts of the single-story building to come down as they leveled the first section.\n\nOfficials had declared the school off-limits to everyone except the contractors hired to demolish it.

The steel will be melted, and nothing identifiable will be leaving the site.”\n\nThe town voted on Oct. 5 to accept nearly $50 million in state money for a new school to be built on the same site. The vote came five months after a task force recommended demolishing the old building.\n\nThe task force considered other possible sites for a new school; some parents said they were worried that seizing land by eminent domain would add anger to the emotions the community has had to deal with.\n\nMore than 400 students are attending classes in a school building in nearby Monroe, Conn., that had been empty.

In Washington, some former opponents of gun control signaled that they may change their position, potentially giving stricter gun laws their best chance of passage in years.\n\nThe most notable rejection of the gun industry came when the private-equity firm Cerberus Capital Management announced it would sell the maker of the rifle used in the massacre, which it called a "watershed event."\n\nThe shooting "raised the national debate on gun control to an unprecedented level,"Cerberus said in a news release. "We are investors, not statesmen or policy makers."\n\nIn an acknowledgment of the changing political climate, the National Rifle Association promised "to offer meaningful contributions to help make sure this never happens again." It scheduled a Friday news conference.\n\nBushmaster, Remington and DPMS are among the brands made by Freedom Group Inc., the largest firearms maker in the U.S.\n\nThe Madison, N.C., company sold 1.1 million rifles and shotguns last year, along with 2 billion rounds of ammunition. Its customers include law enforcement and military agencies, as well as retailers who serve hunters and gun enthusiasts.\n\nCerberus, a large private-equity firm best known for investing in Chrysler and other troubled corporations, appeared to have been under pressure from two sources: investors and the threat of more gun control.\n\nOfficials at California\'s huge teacher pension fund said they were reviewing a $600 million investment in Cerberus in light of the Connecticut shooting. Through its stake in Cerberus, the California State Teachers\' Retirement System owns a 2.4 percent stake in Freedom Group.\n\nPension fund spokesman Michael Sicilia confirmed the fund owns about $4 million in shares of Sturm Ruger & Co. and $1.7 million in Smith and Wesson.\n\nCerberus filed papers in 2009 to take Freedom Group public, but it withdrew the bid in 2011 without saying why. A Cerberus spokesman declined to comment Tuesday beyond the company\'s statement.\n\nFreedom Group has lost money in four of the last five years, according to financial filings on its website. Revenue in 2011 was $775 million, down from $848.7 million in 2009. Slightly more than half of its 2011 revenue came from guns, much of the rest from ammunition.\n\nThe assault weapons ban that expired in 2004 restricted the sale of some types of guns like those made by Bushmaster. The adoption of a similar law "could have a material adverse effect on our business," Freedom Group said in a statement.\n\nIn 2010, Freedom Group said it would close its Bushmaster plant in Windham, Maine, and shift the work to a plant in Ilion, N.Y. At the time, New York Sen. Charles Schumer praised the move as a way to strengthen Remington\'s ability to compete for Defense Department gun contracts.\n\nFirms like Cerberus are basically privately run pools of money that invest in companies on behalf of pension funds. On Tuesday, the fund attempted to distance itself from the national debate.\n\n"It is not our role to take positions, or attempt to shape or influence the gun control policy debate," the firm said. "That is the job of our federal and state legislators."\n\nMeanwhile, Dick\'s Sporting Goods Inc. suspended sales of all "modern sporting rifles," the industry term for military-style guns. The company also removed all guns from display at its store closest to Newtown.\n\nDick\'s has not promoted military-style guns as much as some other retailers. Its circular distributed in newspapers on Sunday had a full page of hunting rifles, but no military-style ones.\n\nBy contrast, St. Paul-based retailer Gander Mountain featured in its own flier the Black Rain Ordnance PG9, a military-style semiautomatic rifle, for $2,000. Other military-style guns were also advertised, including several from Bushmaster. Such ads are generally printed well in advance and would have been prepared before Friday\'s shooting.\n\nA Gander Mountain spokesman declined to comment on whether it would change its gun lineup.\n\nWal-Mart Stores Inc., which offers Bushmaster rifles in some stores, said it would not change the guns it sells, but company spokesman David Tovar said the web listing for the Bushmaster "was taken down in light of the tragic events."\n\nAll the talk about additional gun control appeared to be driving increased gun sales, though. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation said it received a record 4,154 requests for background checks on Saturday, the day after the shooting.\n\nThat was slightly more than on its normal biggest day, Black Friday.\n\nBob Irwin, CEO of The Gun Store in Las Vegas, said customer traffic has jumped since the school shooting, with many customers concerned that more gun laws will be enacted. He has not pulled any guns from the shelf.\n\n"My belief is the individual nutcase did this," he said. "The company that manufactured the gun didn\'t. That seems silly to deprive my normal customers of product because somebody misused a product from the same company."\n\nIrwin agreed that the Connecticut attack demanded some kind of action.

So on December 14, when it became clear that something was amiss at a school there, his editors gave him the address on the scanner asked him to look into it.\n\n“No one said Sandy Hook school—I had no idea,” said Leukhardt (who, full disclosure, was my first internship editor and remains a dear friend). “When I got there, I realized, this is where Lauren teaches.” Lauren was Leukhardt’s stepdaughter, Lauren Rousseau, 30, who died alongside five colleagues and 20 students at Sandy Hook Elementary School when Adam Lanza went on a shooting rampage there. Leukhardt told his story at the prompting of Dart Center executive director Bruce Shapiro on Monday, part of a daylong series of conversations, “Sandy Hook and Beyond.” The symposium was co-organized at Columbia’s Journalism School by its Dart and Tow Centers.\n\nAt first, Leukardt continued, there was a rumor that a custodian had shot himself in the foot, and he remembered hoping that Lauren, a substitute teacher, wasn’t too traumatized by the incident. “Within a half an hour or so, it was clear that this was not the story.” He left, concerned about covering an event that could involve a relative. It wasn’t until 1am that he and Lauren’s mom officially learned that she was among the dead.\n\nLeukhardt found himself sought out by reporters, a complete reversal of the usual order wherein he wielded the notebook. His takeaway from being source rather than journalist was similar to that of many other panelists who spoke throughout the day—from Newtown First Selectwoman Pat Llodra to longtime CT State Police spokesman Lt. J. Paul Vance. It was this: “Kindness is what really resonates with families in crisis,” he said. “There might be worse times than this, but I can’t imagine what they might be … If someone says, ‘I’d rather not talk with you,’ don’t pester them.”\n\nIt’s a lesson that speakers also extended to residents in Boston and in Watertown, MA, in the wake of the fatal Boston Marathon bombings and the subsequent manhunt for the suspects. The raw events formed a subtext for the day’s discussion, and the final panel included Boston Globe columnist Kevin Cullen.\n\nOf the media back in Newtown, Lt. Vance said, “Every single one of them treated this horrific tragedy with respect and dignity.” Journalists left this positive impression even while descending on the hamlet of Sandy Hook in such numbers that, Llodra said, businesses disrupted by the gridlock have yet to recover four months later. Llodra became the de facto spokeswoman for the town, and Vance became the keeper of updates about the shooting. He said that he told reporters not to trust information about the scene that didn’t have his signature attached and to await his his regular press conferences at the designated location. Each victim’s family was also assigned a police officer, partly to keep a member of law enforcement between them and the media.\n\nOf course, staying within assigned areas goes against a journalist’s DNA; we know that the best stories come from wandering afield, talking to everyone, and trying to piece events into a narrative.\n\n“We’re not going to get all the truth that way; we’re just going to get the official statements,” said Jacqueline Smith, managing editor of the Danbury News-Times, where Lauren’s mother works. The paper, she said, must “keep informing, keep pushing and prodding—the investigative part of the story as well as the human part.” But it’s one thing to be a lone reporter or a familiar local news outlet, and quite another to form a gantlet of news cameras opposite a church like the one I witnessed at Lauren’s funeral.\n\nWhile some panelists said reporters should respect people’s grief, others noted that showing compassion and having reporting access aren’t mutually exclusive. Courant journalist Matthew Kauffman (another friend) said that he was recently asked if all those journalists really needed to be in Newtown in the aftermath of the shootings. “I imagined the scene at the firehouse immediately afterward, with these terrified parents,” Kauffman said. “All of that must have been scary and traumatic. But nobody would say, ‘Do we really need that many cops on the scene there? Could you put the helicopters away?’” He continued, “I make sort of a modest proposal that in a tragedy like this, the media has a role to play as well … Journalists, to some extent, should be seen as first responders as well.”\n\nAnd like local cops and firefighters, who respond to incidents on Day One and then remain connected because they live and work there, local reporters get the opportunity to write the meaty stories after the mainstream media pack scurries after the next siren. The Courant ran a profile series on victim families, like this one Kauffman wrote about the Bardens, who created a Facebook page that encourages people to spread the joy they found within their son, Daniel. (The New Yorker also wrote a deep dive on the role of the local paper, the Newtown Bee.)\n\nBeyond treatment of grieving families and traumatic events’ aftermath, the press has the power to shape discussion in broader ways, panelists said. Kauffman said that journalists must learn the complexities of the post-Newtown gun control debate to cover it well. “I think it’s more divisive than abortion. I think it’s more divisive than equality for gays and lesbians,” he said. Psychiatrist Charles Herrick suggested that reporters should tread carefully when mentioning mental illness or developmental disorders, because having a diagnosis—shooter Adam Lanza reportedly had Asperger’s Syndrome—is not a red flag for committing violence. “It’s impossible [for clinicians] to be able to predict these things,” he said. And Llodra said that she sees the press as holding the ability to help Newtown heal.\n\n“You hold our future a little bit in your hands, so please treat us gently,” she said. “Treat us with care.”\n\nHas America ever needed a media watchdog more than now?

And frankly, I’m opposed to anybody releasing any photos without the parents’ permission.\n\nTHR: So when they said you were advocating or launching a campaign to release these photos, that was incorrect?\n\nMoore: That is absolutely incorrect. What I said is that when and if they do come out in this day of Internet and social media, the likelihood of that happening is reasonable. So what to do when it happens? I was just saying that that’s what will happen, and I ask that Americans not turn away from it. And the example I gave was how Emmett Till’s mother, back in 1955 when he was tortured and then killed by the Ku Klux Klan, released the photos of his body to show what the Klan had done to him. It ignited the country and four months later, Rosa Parks sat down on the bus. It had a cause and effect when a mother chose to do that. But that’s the only way that should be done -- when the parent decides whatever they want to do to let people know just what happens to a child when 11 bullets from a high-powered rifle at close range are fired into their bodies.\n\nBecause I made Bowling for Columbine, I looked at a lot of photographs of various shootings, and it’s not like it is on TV. It would be awfully hard to turn away, as it was hard to turn away for the people in 1955 from Emmett Till’s body, as it was hard for Americans in the 1960s when they saw the little girl running down the road, the Napalm having burned the clothes off her body.\n\nPHOTO: Michael Moore Mourns Hugo Chavez, Posts Snapshot With Late Venezuelan President\n\nTHR: Why do you think the parents misunderstood your intentions?\n\nMoore: I don’t know, because here’s the odd thing. Some of the parents had contacted me directly after [the massacre]. I made no contact with them. I had no interest. I’m not doing anything with this, I’m not making a documentary. I’m not doing anything with it other than being a citizen trying to get gun legislation passed. But I was contacted by some of the kids’ parents shortly after the massacre asking for my advice and help, and I had some interaction with them at that time. Then we were in touch after I wrote this post on Huffington Post about two months ago, actually thanking me for what I had written.\n\nWhen you read the whole thing, [you see that] I’m not calling for the release of these photos, for Christ’s sake. I’m saying when and if a parent decides to do this, or if sadly they’re leaked, I’m encouraging people not to turn away. It’s our responsibility to these children to know what our laws did to them.\n\nTHR: Do you think, though, that perhaps your wording could have been interpreted as having been intended to incite the leaking of the pictures?\n\nMoore: No. You don’t know me personally but you probably think that you know me. If I was going to make a call for something like that, I’d say those words. I’m not afraid to say that. If I want to call people to sit down in the middle of the road to block the next shipment of armaments out to the next war, I’ll say that. [...] More than a lot of people, I’ve been an observer of this, because I’ve been involved in this issue for close to 15 years. There’s probably no better proof than [the fact that] I obtained not just photos but the footage of Columbine. And I didn’t put that in my movie.\n\nSTORY: Michael Moore Praises Gun Control, Slams Obama on Drones: \'We Like to Kill Our Own\'\n\nI know that when I first posted this, Fox News got one person up in Newtown to go on the record, and that person, with Fox News, tried to stir the pot and create a news story that didn’t exist. It’s sick. My guess is that somebody up there at some point decided that they could get away with doing this.\n\nTHR: Is there anything you’d do at this point to show the parents of Sandy Hook victims that you are on their side and/or support House Bill 6424?\n\nMoore: I just found out about this [petition] in the last 20 minutes. I’m going to contact [victims\' parents] tonight. And I’ll make sure that whoever is stirring the pot stops stirring it and stops lying about me. [Take] what I did with photos and footage of Columbine: I only put in security footage of the two killers, but I would not show them shooting anybody. I just didn’t think that that was right. For instance, if somebody sent me crime scene photos tonight from Newtown, there’s no way that I would put them on my website -- and in fact, I’d inform the parents right away that somebody’s attempting to do something without their permission.\n\nTHR: Is there anything else you\'d like to say?\n\nMoore: I just want to tell you this, because I unfortunately had to view photos like this of other shootings. And when that kind of bullet from that kind of gun is used at close range, I don’t know how to put into words how to describe how horrific it looks. Probably the best way to describe it is what a couple of the parents said after the shooting, which is, the only way they could identify the bodies of the children is by the clothes that they dressed them in that morning. So think about that. And the sick nature of the killer, [Adam] Lanza. It appears that he killed each of them with the first bullet, because he was very close. But he pumped up to 11 bullets in each of their bodies. That’s according to the coroner’s report. And you’re able to do that because we allow our citizens to carry massive numbers of bullets in clips and magazines. Hard to do that when you’re putting a bullet in a musket, the kind of armament that they were talking about in 1790.', 'title': "Michael Moore on Sandy Hook: No Photos Without Parents' Permission (Q&A)", 'url': 'https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/michael-moore-sandy-hook-no-562002', 'keywords': ['sandy', 'photos', 'parents', 'know', 'victims', 'way', 'moore', 'michael', 'im', 'qa', 'release', 'away', 'permission', 'hook', 'think'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'STORY: Michael Moore Targeted by Parents of Sandy Hook VictimsThe Hollywood Reporter: What is your position on the release of Sandy Hook crime scene photos?\nMichael Moore: I never said that I was going to release any photos, nor do I have any intention to.\nAnd frankly, I’m opposed to anybody releasing any photos without the parents’ permission.\nTHR: So when they said you were advocating or launching a campaign to release these photos, that was incorrect?\nPHOTO: Michael Moore Mourns Hugo Chavez, Posts Snapshot With Late Venezuelan PresidentTHR: Why do you think the parents misunderstood your intentions?', 'date': 1370280032}, {'text': 'We use cookies to give you the best online experience.

But Adam Lanza’s horrifying mass murder in Newton, Conn. almost a year ago remains an unresolved pain in the hearts of many Americans.\n\nWe search for something to blame in order to get closure from both getting justice and acting to prevent a similar tragedy. Unfortunately, that answer remains elusive.\n\nOn Monday, Connecticut State’s Attorney’s Stephen J. Sedensky III released the final report of the Dec. 14 events in which Adam Lanza shot and killed his mother, himself and 20 children and six educators in Newtown. Mr. Sedensky closed the investigation without charging anyone or finding a motive for the crimes.\n\nBlame the guns?\n\nBefore the children’s bodies had been taken out of the school, politicians like New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg blamed guns, not the murderer, for the events. Within 48 hours, President Obama called for new gun control laws, including “assault-weapon” and “high-capacity magazine” bans to prevent the rare mass shooting.\n\nThe state’s attorney report shows that all the guns and ammunition were legally bought by the shooter’s mother, Nancy Lanza.\n\nLanza used a Bushmaster Model XM15-E2S rifle in 5.56 caliber in the mass killing, then killed himself with a Glock 20 pistol in 10mm. He also carried a Sig Sauer P226 in 9mm, which he did not use.\n\n(The shooter brought a Izhmash Saiga-12, 12 gauge semi-automatic shotgun to the school but left it in his car. A police officer put the shotgun into the trunk of the car for security purposes following the shooting. This has resulted in Internet conspiracy theories that the shotgun, not the rifle, was used in the shooting. These theories are unfounded. All the shell casing found at the murder scene are 5.56 rifle ammunition or from the suicide shot from the Glock.)\n\nLanza was 20 years old, so he was a year shy of being allowed to possess a handgun under Connecticut law, which he disregarded that day. Mrs. Lanza had a legal pistol permit.\n\nThe shooter only stopped when the police arrived. He had plenty of ammunition and was prepared to continue changing magazines and reloading.\n\nThe rifle found near Lanza had a magazine only half-empty. Police found two empty 30-round magazines duct-taped together in a tactical configuration at the scene.\n\nGun-control advocates often cite “high-capacity” magazines as a cause of gun violence, but the sophisticated way Lanza prepared his weapons showed how easy it is to change a magazine of any size and reload, even in an active shooter situation.\n\nMrs. Lanza was out of town leading up to the crime that her son committed the morning after she returned. He shot her in the head four times with a .22 caliber Savage Mark II rifle while she was in bed.\n\nIt is a shame that Mrs. Lanza gave her mentally ill son access to firearms. If the mother had locked her guns and not allowed her son to enjoy shooting — which the report says was a pastime he enjoyed — perhaps that would have prevented the shooting with those guns.\n\nHowever, Lanza planned this killing over a long period of time. He conducted drive-by runs to the school. He had a spreadsheet of mass murders and studied school shootings. Even if he didn’t have access to his mother’s guns, one can presume he would have stolen them from another home.\n\nAnd if he had tried to buy a rifle, he would have passed the FBI background check because there’s nothing in his records preventing him from owning a firearm.\n\nBlame mental illness?\n\nIt’s easy to blame Mrs. Lanza for letting her crazy kid have access to guns, but according to the investigation, she did not know her son had violent tendencies and said he had “Asperger’s syndrome,” which is on the autism spectrum.\n\n“The mother never expressed fear of the shooter, for her own safety or that of anyone else,” the report says. “The investigation has not discovered any evidence that Nancy Lanza was in any way aware of her son’s plans.”\n\nThe multitude of reports that said Mrs. Lanza tried and failed to have her son institutionalized were wrong. Lanza would only communicate with her via email, demanded to have his laundry done every day and was not functional, yet his mother merely planned to move in order to get him into a special school or a job.\n\nIt could be denial by a parent who loves her child no matter how deranged he is, but the professionals didn’t see it coming, either. The investigation does not conclude what, if any, role mental health played in the shooter’s motivation, but explicitly states that the “mental health professionals who saw him did not see anything that would have predicted his future behavior.”\n\nEven among lay people who knew Lanza, they reported that, “He displayed no aggressive or threatening tendencies.”\n\nFurthermore, the state’s attorney said that Lanza was well enough to know how to plan the murder, control his behavior and know it was wrong. The evidence supporting this conclusion include using ear plugs during the shooting, damaging his computer’s hard drive in advance and removing the GPS from his car.\n\nBlame prescription drugs?\n\nDespite the seemingly serious mental illness, Lanza did not take prescriptions drugs. The toxicology report released showed no alcohol or drugs of any kind in his system at the time of his death.\n\nBlame video games?\n\nLanza played a lot of video games, but about half of them were nonviolent. At one point, his favorite game was “Super Mario Brothers.”\n\nHe played a lot of “Dance Dance Revolution,” which he would use to dance along with the video. The GPS in his home showed that he went almost every Friday and Saturday to a local theater that had a commercial version of “Dance Dance Revolution” in the lobby, which he would play from four to 10 hours at a time.\n\nBlame bullying?\n\nThere are mixed reports of Lanza being bullied for his odd behavior throughout his childhood, but the accusations mostly come from the mother and father, Peter Lanza. Investigators found no evidence of bullying from teachers and other students who knew him in middle or upper school.\n\nWhile Lanza attended Sandy Hook Elementary, he was never in the two classrooms in which he killed the children. He has said he “loved the school.”\n\nBlame school security?\n\nThe school doors were locked and secure at 9:30 a.m. with a video camera and buzzer system that can allow entry after that time from three monitoring locations. Lanza simply shot through the plate-glass window next to the lobby door to enter the school.\n\nA 911 call was made at 9:35 a.m. It took less than five minutes for the police to get to the school. About a minute later, Lanza shot and killed himself. The first officer entered the school at 9:44 a.m.\n\nIn that tight time frame, it seems the only thing that could have stopped Lanza was a good guy inside the school with a gun. There were no armed security guards at Sandy Hook Elementary School, nor did any of the staff have a weapons.\n\nIn the end, we can’t blame lax gun-control laws, access to mental health treatment, prescription drugs or video games for Lanza’s terrible killing spree.\n\nWe can point to a mother who should have been more aware of how sick her son had become and forced treatment.\n\nWe can wish the school had an armed guard who could have, at least, slowed down the homicidal maniac.\n\nWe all would like to go back in time and stop Adam Lanza from getting a gun and going into Sandy Hook Elementary School and bring those children and teachers back to life.\n\nThe sad conclusion is that we live in a broken world and, at times, evil cannot be stopped.\n\nEmily Miller is senior editor of opinion for The Washington Times andauthor of “Emily Gets Her Gun” (Regnery, 2013).\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright © 2018 The Washington Times, LLC.

Fox also cited an unnamed senior law enforcement official saying anger at plans for “his future mental-health treatment” were being investigated as a possible motive.\n\nWhile the Fox reports are still uncorroborated, other media reports paint a general picture that suggests Ms. Lanza was growing increasingly concerned about the mental health of her son.\n\nThese reports are bringing to light a debate over where to set the bar when it comes to forcing an individual into treatment – and whether those caring for people with mental-health issues have enough resources available to head off potential crises before they happen.\n\nOn one hand, warning signs are often apparent, so making it easier to commit someone for involuntary treatment could save lives.\n\nThe young adult men who end up being violent often “have others in their lives … who are trying desperately to get help before something bad happens. They can see it coming down the pike,” says Liza Gold, a clinical professor of psychiatry at Georgetown University School of Medicine. But caregivers “have run up against these commitment laws that are so restrictive – that come down so far on the side of civil liberties and privacy – that it is almost impossible to contain, hospitalize, treat someone with a chronic and escalating mental illness.”\n\nOn the other hand, forced treatment can also be emotionally wrenching for the patient and cause lingering anger, mental-health experts say.\n\n“People who are forcibly treated so often feel traumatized by it,” says Robert Whitaker, author of “Anatomy of an Epidemic: Magic Bullets, Psychiatric Drugs, and the Astonishing Rise of Mental Illness in America.” “Women in particular will sometimes talk about it almost like a quasi-rape, because sometimes they are held down and injected,” he says.\n\nFor its part, Connecticut leans strongly toward supporting the civil liberties of individuals, making involuntary treatment difficult. It is one of six states that does not provide the option of "assisted outpatient treatment,” which allows qualifying individuals to receive court-ordered treatment in the community without being committed to a facility.\n\nMoreover, an individual needs to be dangerous before intervention is possible. The state’s standard does not take into consideration an individual’s past psychiatric history, such as repeated hospitalizations or symptoms of psychiatric deterioration that could culminate in violence.\n\n“Connecticut\'s civil commitment laws are among the most restrictive in the nation when it comes to getting help for a loved one in psychiatric crisis,” said Kristina Ragosta, senior legislative and policy counsel for the Treatment Advocacy Center in Arlington, Va., which pushes to make it easier to commit people for treatment before they become dangerous.\n\nConnecticut does have a law allowing for someone to be sent to the hospital for 72 hours for evaluation if he or she poses a danger to himself or others, says Kate Mattias, executive director of the Connecticut branch of the National Alliance on Mental Illness.\n\nEmergency mobile psychiatric services in hospitals – including one in Danbury, near Newtown – can come to a home or other location to bring someone into the hospital, she says. And after the 72 hours, if someone can demonstrate that he or she is a continued threat, a judge can order a 14-day stay, she says.\n\nBut Ms. Mattias\'s group and some other advocates oppose involuntary commitment because it “creates an adversary relationship that really poisons any relationship with providers, with caregivers,” she says. “This is one of the lingering fears that people who are living with mental illness have when you start to talk about involuntary commitment – you raise this specter of, ‘They’re going to put me away and throw away the key.’ ”\n\nAccording to Fox, Joshua Flashman, a US Marine and an acquaintance of the Lanzas, said Ms. Lanza “was petitioning the court for conservatorship and wanted to have him committed…. Adam was apparently very upset about this. He thought she just wanted to send him away.”\n\nFox was not able to confirm that with a court official, who said such records are sealed.\n\nLater Thursday, the New York Daily News reported that a family friend said Ms. Lanza had brought her son to a psychiatrist as he became increasingly antisocial. But the unnamed friend said Ms. Lanza was not planning to have him committed. “Nancy was so dedicated to Adam,” the friend said. “She would never send him away. She just couldn’t do that.”\n\nExperts say it is plausible that Mr. Lanza’s actions could have been triggered by anger over the possibility of forced treatment. “Generally we know that a great many violent acts, particularly between intimates, are triggered by moments of perceived loss,” says Christopher Ferguson, a professor of psychology and criminal justice at Texas A&M International University in Laredo. There’s a heightened possibility of violence, for instance, after a stalker or abuser is charged or served with a restraining order, he notes.\n\nBut even if people are willing to be committed, it’s not easy to get such treatment, because the US moved away from the asylum system in the 1950s and ’60s, Ferguson says.\n\nThere were good reasons for this, but perhaps the pendulum has swung too far and made it overly difficult for people to get mental health treatment, voluntarily or otherwise, he and some others suggest.\n\n“The funding is so limited that the average length of stay is three to seven days, but most psychiatric medications take two to six weeks to kick in,” says Professor Gold of Georgetown.\n\nThere should be an easier way for people to at least be “contained” temporarily to calm down if someone close to them can see that they are in crisis and could become dangerous, says Gold. “These crises pass. These people don’t wake up every day of their lives [homicidal],” she says.\n\nThe details certainly aren’t clear yet about what kind of treatment, if any, Ms. Lanza previously sought, or wanted in the future, for Mr. Lanza.\n\nShe had talked about moving to Washington State with her son because of a school there that she thought could help him, according to a Concord Monitor article that quoted Mark Tambascio, an owner of My Place, a Newtown restaurant frequented by Ms. Lanza.\n\nOther media outlets have reported that Mr. Lanza spent time in a variety of school settings and had also been home-schooled by his mother.\n\nParents of troubled young people may need therapeutic support themselves, says Mattias of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. There’s a strong stigma in society where parents get the message that their child’s problems are somehow the parents’ fault, she says, and “parents over time can become isolated…. It’s very very hard to handle these things on your own.”\n\nMothers are the highest percentage of the people murdered by mentally ill young men, Gold adds. “The [young men] are usually living at home because they are dysfunctional…. The moms don’t bail. These are their children. They hang in with them, they try to get them help. And they’re the ones that get killed.”\n\nBut mental-health advocates caution against drawing overly broad conclusions. “You can’t predict what the reaction would be [to a family member seeking to impose treatment] or whether it would increase dangerousness,” says Michael Fitzpatrick, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness.\n\nFollow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.\n\nAdvocates also urge a renewed commitment to prevention, so that fewer caregivers end up having to make such difficult choices\n\nThere have been comprehensive reports on how to improve mental-health care, dating back to President Carter\'s administration, says Robert Bernstein, president and CEO of The Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law in Washington. Early intervention and prevention are key, he says, but “when funding gets cut those are the first programs to go.… What we have now is a system that only in rare instances does anything preventive.”', 'title': 'Sandy hook shooting: Was Adam Lanza lashing out against treatment?', 'url': 'https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2012/1219/Sandy-hook-shooting-Was-Adam-Lanza-lashing-out-against-treatment', 'keywords': ['shooting', 'sandy', 'lanza', 'treatment', 'adam', 'mental', 'ms', 'reports', 'commitment', 'lashing', 'mentalhealth', 'young', 'committed', 'hook', 'psychiatric'], 'tags': {'President Carter', 'America', 'Robert Bernstein', 'Sandy Hook', 'Fox News', 'Concord Monitor', 'Washington State', 'Michael Fitzpatrick', 'Christopher Ferguson', 'Texas A&M', 'Adam Lanza', 'Connecticut', 'Washington', 'US Marine', 'New York Daily News', 'National Alliance on Mental Illness', 'Danbury', 'Georgetown University School of Medicine', 'Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law', 'Arlington, Va.'}, 'summary': 'Fox also cited an unnamed senior law enforcement official saying anger at plans for “his future mental-health treatment” were being investigated as a possible motive.\nWhile the Fox reports are still uncorroborated, other media reports paint a general picture that suggests Ms. Lanza was growing increasingly concerned about the mental health of her son.\nLater Thursday, the New York Daily News reported that a family friend said Ms. Lanza had brought her son to a psychiatrist as he became increasingly antisocial.\nBut the unnamed friend said Ms. Lanza was not planning to have him committed.\nThe details certainly aren’t clear yet about what kind of treatment, if any, Ms. Lanza previously sought, or wanted in the future, for Mr. Lanza.', 'date': 1355958780}, {'text': 'Story highlights Connecticut police chiefs\' group review Newtown police response time to shooting\n\nReport says officers "responded to the scene rapidly, positioned themselves appropriately"\n\nThe review found that officers were unable to intervene before the shooter took his own life\n\nA review of police response to the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School has found that officers "responded to the scene rapidly, positioned themselves appropriately, and followed their department policy," according to a report by the Connecticut Police Chiefs Association.\n\nThe nine-page report analyzing the Newtown Police Department\'s response time and entry to the school during last December\'s mass shooting was written by a subcommittee of four police chiefs from the state.\n\n"Our evaluation showed that the officers of the Newtown Police Department navigated the inevitable chaos created in the first few minutes of such a call, managed to piece together what was occurring, but were unable to intervene before the shooter took his own life," according to the report, which was released Thursday.\n\nThe review references a CNN report that said, "Police and other first responders arrived on scene about 20 minutes after the first calls."\n\nCNN initially reported police arrived "within 20 minutes."\n\nThe committee had access to 911 recordings, dispatch tapes, first-responder and officer statements as well as other documentation.

They instructed her to have the schoolchildren hold hands and close their eyes.\n\n"At 5, it\'s not so easy to close your eyes and walk," Vollmer said. "So I had them look toward the wall." They all had to be brave.\n\nPresident Barack Obama eulogized the teachers in a speech to Newtown and the nation Sunday night.\n\n"They responded as we all hope we might respond in such terrifying circumstances -- with courage and with love, giving their lives to protect the children in their care," he said.\n\n"We know that there were other teachers who barricaded themselves inside classrooms, and kept steady through it all, and reassured their students by saying \'Wait for the good guys, they\'re coming\'; \'Show me your smile.\'"\n\nNow Newtown will need to muster the courage to rebuild, to keep raising the siblings of fallen angels, to face another day without a beloved child.\n\nSandy Hook Elementary will probably move into another building, away from the scene of the spilled blood and bullet holes. Teachers and children will go back to class, prepare lessons, do homework, take tests and grade them.\n\n"We need to get the kids back in school," Vollmer said.\n\nVollmer, her colleagues and the children have all seen and heard too much and gotten through it bravely. Even soldiers experience permanent trauma after seeing a child being killed -- let alone 20 at once.\n\n---------\n\nThe stories of how these teachers and school administrators risked their lives -- and in six instances gave them -- to protect their young students spurred CNN readers to label them heroes.\n\n"The next time people criticize teachers, think of these heroes and know that any teacher would do the same for their students. Your children," wrote Tom in the online comment section below this story. "How many dozen lives were likely saved because the teachers and administrators knew what to do?"\n\n"Let\'s try and remember these heroic women\'s names and forget the gunman\'s name starting today," said a person using the name druglady33.\n\nMargaret Kime called their actions "Unimaginable grace when faced with unimaginable horror."\n\nCommenter marsh025 suggested the school principal should have been armed and able to fight off the attacker:\n\n"She should have come out with guns blazing. (I never thought I would say that) At the very least, principals need to be armed and trained in locating and engaging gunmen who enter their schools. The principal and a security/police officer should go together, armed to confront the individual.

On Monday, she spoke at a press event. But Sunday, the anniversary, was private.\n\n“Yesterday was a very quiet day spent reflecting with family and friends,” Hockley said Monday. “In the words of my husband, as he wrote to some people, we truly have been carried by our friends through this, at times, when we weren’t sure we could stand.”\n\nHockley stood Monday in a hearing room at the Legislative Office Building in Hartford with Mark Barden, another Sandy Hook parent, U.S. Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy, U.S. Rep. Elizabeth Esty and others to talk about how to curb the 32,000 gun deaths in the U.S. every year.\n\nHockley is an activist now, a woman who says she refuses to see school shootings and other gun-death violence as random events. She says she was too busy with the chores of being a suburban mother to take notice of gun violence before Sandy Hook.\n\n“Every gun-related death is a preventable death,” Hochley said. “We are gaining momentum.”\n\nShe and Barden were among the plaintiffs to file suit in Superior Court in Bridgeport against the companies that manufactured, distributed and sold the AR-15 rifle used in the attack.

Dylan had a beaming smile that lit up a room and infectious laugh. Dylan was a child with autism, but was learning to read and would come home every day from school proudly bearing a new book. He loved the moon, garlic bread, the color purple, cuddling, and bouncing on the trampoline.”\n\nHis mother says he was shot multiple times and died instantly in the arms of a special-education assistant, who also was killed in the attack.\n\nIn the gun-control movement, there is before and after Dec. 14, 2012.\n\nOne advocacy group tracks school shootings since that date, though its data has been questioned.

The Office of the Child Advocate, which investigates all child deaths in Connecticut for prevention lessons, released a 114-page report today. Lanza was 20 on Dec. 14, 2012 when he shot his mother, Nancy Lanza and then went to the Sandy Hook Elementary School where he massacred 20 first-graders and six educators before taking his own life. Inside Adam Lanza\'s Bedroom Sandy Hook Gunman\'s Father Wishes Son Was Never Born The report\'s authors say they "looked for any warning signs, red flags, or other lessons that could be learned from a review of AL\'s life," referring to Lanza. "This report cannot and does not answer the question of \'why\' AL committed murder," the authors wrote. Here are some of the disturbing things we learned about Lanza.\n\n1. Lanza had a falling out with his "one and only friend" months before. Among the factors that may have caused Lanza "anxiety" before the shooting were the possibility of moving with his mother and a "falling out" with an unnamed friend. "AL was acquainted with another adolescent that he played [video game Dance Dance Revolution] with on a regular basis," the report said. "They would meet a few times per month to either play the video game or go to the movies. AL and his friend talked about multiple topics, including computers, chimp society, human nature, morality, prejudice, and sometimes about his family. AL told his friend that he had a strained relationship with his mother." Timeline of Sandy Hook Elementary Shooting "AL would sometimes talk with this friend about the topic of mental health or depression, though he never indicated that he was diagnosed with anything. He did tell his friend that mental health issues were not a reflection of the character of a person, but were symptoms of something else going on inside a person," the report said. "AL and the friend also talked about their interest in mass murderers or serial killers, but this was just considered to be a mutual morbid interest," the report said. "Both he and his acquaintance liked horror movies." But in June 2012, Lanza "and his primary acquaintance had a falling out and stopped spending time together," the report said, "after a dispute over a movie."\n\nBarcroft Media via Getty Images 2. His "social-emotional" challenges increased after fourth grade. Lanza was referred for special education preschool services at age 2. "[Lanza] was presented with significant developmental challenges from earliest childhood, including communication and sensory difficulties, socialization delays, and repetitive behaviors," the report states. "He was seen by the New Hampshire \'Birth to Three\' intervention program when he was almost three years old and referred for special education preschool services." Watch: Sandy Hook Shooter\'s Father Describes How Adam Lanza Changed Early in the fourth grade, Lanza left the special education program because he had "met all speech goals," the report states. During Lanza\'s early elementary school years, his parents still lived together in the family home in Sandy Hook, but they separated in 2002 when Lanza was in the fifth grade. "[Lanza] was described by some as seeming happy, smiling, and participating in community and school activities," the report states. "At the same time, however, more red flags for developmental and mental health concerns remained or emerged. AL began perseverative hand washing, avoiding contact with other people, and becoming increasingly fearful. By fifth grade, AL had written and submitted \'The Big Book of Granny\' — a significant and violent text — and following that school year, his struggles began to escalate."\n\nPeter Foley/EPA 3. His preoccupation with violence may have been "largely unaddressed." The report raises questions about how there may have been missed opportunities with Lanza, including whether his family\'s wealth and race were factors. "Would [Lanza\'s] caregivers’ reluctance to maintain him in school or a treatment program have gone under the radar if he were a child of color?" the report asks. Lanza\'s mother transferred him to a Catholic school for the fourth quarter of seventh grade. "A teacher at the school later reported that he presented very differently from the other children," the report states. Schools Helped Newton Shooter\'s Mom \'Appease\' Him Newtown Shooter Lanza Had Sensory Processing Disorder According to the teacher\'s account in the report, he had "very distinct anti-social issues." "AL would write ten pages obsessing about battles, destruction and war. I have known 7th grade boys to talk about things like this, but AL’s level of violence was disturbing. I remember showing the writings to the principal at the time, AL’s creative writing was so graphic that it could not be shared," the teacher\'s account in the report states. "It was not the primary purpose of this investigation to explicitly examine the role of guns in the Sandy Hook shootings," the report said. "However, the conclusion cannot be avoided that access to guns is relevant to an examination of ways to improve the public health. Access to assault weapons with high capacity magazines did play a major role in this and other mass shootings in recent history." The report states, "[Lanza] and his parents did not appear to seek or participate in any mental health treatment after 2008."\n\nJulio Cortez/AP Photo 4. While he may have been described as "gifted," his cognitive abilities may have been just "average." On Oct. 24, 2006, almost a year after a community psychiatrist first evaluated Lanza, he was seen at the Yale Child Study Center by a clinical psychiatrist, the report states. "The evaluation was purportedly to determine if AL had Obsessive Compulsive Disorder in the context of a putative diagnosis of Asperger Syndrome." The report details how his parents said that their son was "angry" about having to go to Yale and he refused treatment. "The Yale APRN [Advanced Practice Registered Nurse], in a present day interview, offered her view that AL may not, in fact, have had an Autism Spectrum Disorder, but rather that he suffered from disabling anxiety and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder," the report states. More Highlights From Report on Sandy Hook Shooter Meanwhile, the report indicates his parents may have had difficulty accepting his disabilities. "While it is not uncommon for parents to struggle to identify and accept their child as suffering a disabling impairment, the Yale Child Study Center clinicians who evaluated and treated AL felt that his parents, and certainly his mother, may have had greater than average difficulty with accepting the extent of AL’s disabilities," the report states. "Yale did not think that AL was gifted and unique, pointing to the average cognitive abilities captured by the school’s psychological testing." "Adam Lanza\'s parents (and the school) appeared to conceptualize him as intellectually gifted, and much of [his] high school experience catered to his curricular needs," the report said. "In actuality, psychological testing performed by the school district in high school indicated AL’s cognitive abilities were average."', 'title': '5 Disturbing Things We Learned Today About Sandy Hook Shooter Adam Lanza', 'url': 'https://abcnews.go.com/US/disturbing-things-learned-today-sandy-hook-shooter-adam/story?id=27087140', 'keywords': ['sandy', 'states', 'child', 'lanza', 'adam', 'things', 'learned', 'school', 'parents', 'shooter', 'friend', 'al', 'today', 'hook', 'report', 'disturbing'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'ABCNews.com Two years after the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, Connecticut\'s Office of the Child Advocate released a report today detailing the mental health profile of gunman Adam Lanza, noting potential missed opportunities.\nWatch: Sandy Hook Shooter\'s Father Describes How Adam Lanza Changed Early in the fourth grade, Lanza left the special education program because he had "met all speech goals," the report states.\n"It was not the primary purpose of this investigation to explicitly examine the role of guns in the Sandy Hook shootings," the report said.\nThe report states, "[Lanza] and his parents did not appear to seek or participate in any mental health treatment after 2008."\nMore Highlights From Report on Sandy Hook Shooter Meanwhile, the report indicates his parents may have had difficulty accepting his disabilities.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'By choosing “I agree” below, you agree that NPR’s sites use cookies, similar tracking and storage technologies, and information about the device you use to access our sites to enhance your viewing, listening and user experience, personalize content, personalize messages from NPR’s sponsors, provide social media features, and analyze NPR’s traffic.

"Everybody took care of those kids the best that we knew how to in the insanity that was unfolding before us."\n\nReading specialist Becky Virgalla was in a meeting in a conference room near the school\'s front door. "We heard this loud noise and I thought the roof was collapsing," she said. "I just looked at someone and said, \'What was that?\'"\n\n\n\nA 20-year-old gunman had blasted through the glass entryway with a semi-automatic rifle.\n\n"Three people got up and ran out into the hall. We were ready to follow them out to go investigate the sound. I was three steps away from going out into the hall when my principal, Dawn Hochsprung, shouted back, \'Shooter! Stay put!\'"\n\nSomeone had called 911 on a phone linked to the school intercom, which in the chaos was accidentally turned on. The ensuing gunfire could be heard in classrooms all over the school.\n\n"The speaker, I just wanted to climb up on the table underneath it and rip it down," said Clements, "but I was scared \'cause we were always told to stay low, and I had no idea where the shots were coming from. So I tried to sing songs, and we tried to read, and many of us did similar things."\n\nThe shooter went into two first-grade classrooms. Carol Wexler\'s second-grade classroom was directly across the hall. For her, there was no turning off the sounds only feet away.\n\n"I haven\'t told this story," Wexler said. "I think this is a very difficult conversation to have just because of what it brings up for me."\n\nFive minutes: That\'s how long it took the gunman to fire 154 shots -- the last, to take his own life.\n\n"When I gave my report to the police I said, \'Oh, half-hour, 45 minutes," said Virgalla.
