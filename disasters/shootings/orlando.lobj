[{'text': 'Sitora Yusufiy, briefly married to Omar Mateen, says she was shocked by shootings\n\nA "devastated" Sitora Yusufiy, ex-wife of Orlando mass shooting suspect Omar Mateen, said in an interview Sunday outside her Boulder County home that Mateen was "unstable," "bi-polar" and generally abusive toward her during their brief marriage.\n\nYusufiy and her fiancé, Marcio Dias, emerged from their home in the northwest foothills outside of Boulder to offer remarks on a day Yusufiy said is "going to take a while to process."\n\n"I was woken up by my parents calling me saying, \'Sitora, wake up. Sitora, wake up,\'" she said. "The first thing that they told me, \'Your ex-husband was involved in a mass shooting.\'"\n\nAs people across the world also began learning more about the horrific event — at least 50 killed and 53 wounded at the gay nightclub Pulse in Orlando, Fla., in what is the deadliest mass shooting in United States history — Yusufiy said she began to shake and cry.\n\n"More than anything, I was so, so deeply hurt and heartbroken for the families that lost their loved ones," she said. "To be in some way affiliated at one point in my life to someone who caused such a tragedy — it shook me."\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs rain fell and wind whipped outside the couple\'s foothills home, Yusufiy described her volatile marriage to Mateen, with whom she said she has not spoken in at least seven years.\n\nThe Washington Post reported she met Mateen through an online dating service and agreed to move to Florida to be with them. They were married in March 2009, and although she said it only lasted a few months, their divorce was not finalized until 2011.\n\n"In the beginning, he was a normal being that cared about family, loved to joke, loved to have fun," she said.\n\nWithin a few months, though, she "saw his instability," which involved him getting angry for seemingly no reason, then physically abusing her "very often."\n\n"I tried to see the good in him even then," she said, "but my family was very tuned into what I was going through and decided to visit me and rescue me out of the situation."\n\nWhen they arrived in Fort Pierce, Fla., she added, they had to wrestle her out of Mateen\'s arms. She left with only a few belongings, and proceeded for about 18 months with the divorce from New Jersey, while Mateen remained in Florida.\n\nDuring that period, her family members warned Mateen to stay away from her, and said they\'d go to police if he was found trying to contact her.\n\nThough Yusufiy said she observed an unpredictable temper and symptoms of bi-polarity in her ex-husband — she could not say whether he\'d ever been diagnosed as being bi-polar — she said she\'d never observed any indication that Mateen, who reportedly called 911 to pledge allegiance to the Islamic State prior to the club shooting, might be tied to or otherwise supportive of terrorist activity.\n\nShe described Mateen as "religious," which prompted her fiancé to chime in with, "that has nothing to do with it."\n\nSitora Yusufiy, the ex-wife of Orlando shooting suspect Omar Mateen, her fiance Marcio Dias give a statement to the media at their home outside Boulder on Sunday. (Autumn Parry / Staff Photographer)\n\nWhen asked if she could fathom a reason Mateen might have been motivated to open fire on so many people he did not know, Yusufiy said: "Emotional instability. Sickness. He was mentally unstable and mentally ill. That\'s the only explanation I could give."\n\nYusufiy said that she had been interviewed by the FBI on Sunday, and Deborah Sherman, an FBI spokeswoman in Denver, confirmed as much, but declined to elaborate on that aspect of the investigation.\n\nThere\'s no indication that the questioning was anything more than procedural, and at the time Yusufiy spoke with the media, there was no law enforcement presence near the home.\n\nYusufiy, a marketing and art director for Rainforest Awareness Worldwide in Boulder, said, "The work that I do, that me and my fiancé do in the world, is we bring people together, we open them up to harmony of religion, of race, of homosexuality, of orientation — whatever it may be. Acceptance of humanity, of each other, to live in harmony with our Earth.\n\n"For us, this is the most tragic thing that can happen."\n\nAlex Burness: 303-473-1389, burnessa@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/alex_burness', 'title': "From Boulder, ex-wife says Orlando suspect was abusive, 'mentally unstable'", 'url': 'http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_30006402/ex-wife-orlando-shooting-suspect-lives-boulder-says', 'keywords': ['shooting', 'unstable', 'mateen', 'outside', 'yusufiy', 'mass', 'boulder', 'sitora', 'months', 'suspect', 'exwife', 'abusive', 'omar', 'mentally', 'orlando'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Sitora Yusufiy, briefly married to Omar Mateen, says she was shocked by shootingsA "devastated" Sitora Yusufiy, ex-wife of Orlando mass shooting suspect Omar Mateen, said in an interview Sunday outside her Boulder County home that Mateen was "unstable," "bi-polar" and generally abusive toward her during their brief marriage.\n"The first thing that they told me, \'Your ex-husband was involved in a mass shooting.\'"\nShe described Mateen as "religious," which prompted her fiancé to chime in with, "that has nothing to do with it."\nSitora Yusufiy, the ex-wife of Orlando shooting suspect Omar Mateen, her fiance Marcio Dias give a statement to the media at their home outside Boulder on Sunday.\nHe was mentally unstable and mentally ill.

That\'s not to say you can\'t still go show your support and attend events such as Philly Pride, however.\n\nThe first pride parade was held in New York in 1970 to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the Stonewall riots with a celebration of acceptance and openness. Philadelphia\'s 28th pride parade and festival was scheduled for Sunday, and it has not been cancelled because of the shooting. While the event\'s Facebook page did not make reference to the tragedy, it did announce the event\'s intention "to make today\'s parade and festival the best ever" on Sunday morning. Because of the shooting, there is an increased Philadelphia police presence, and thousands have already gathered for the parade, which started at 11:30 EST.\n\nFor some who might have planned to attend the parade but are grief-stricken or scared, attending a pride parade might feel like too much, too soon, and that\'s perfectly understandable. However, those who live in the Philadelphia area and feel the desire to show their support for the LGBTQ community in the wake of this horrible tragedy should consider attending the festival in an act of solidarity.\n\nIf you are interested in attending, the pride festival is located at the Great Plaza at Penn\'s Landing, and wristbands are $15. The festival\'s website suggests taking public transportation, and warns against bringing a backpack for security reasons. Before the festival ends at 6PM, you can catch plenty of entertainment from musical guests like Deborah Cox to belly dance performances. For those who aren\'t able to attend, there are lots of upcoming pride events in the month of June happening all over the country, most of which can be found here.', 'title': 'Attend Philadelphia Pride To Show Your LGBTQ Support In The Wake Of Orlando', 'url': 'https://www.bustle.com/articles/166354-attend-philadelphia-pride-to-show-your-lgbtq-support-in-the-wake-of-orlando', 'keywords': ['attend', 'shooting', 'lgbtq', 'attending', 'thats', 'parade', 'pride', 'events', 'support', 'festival', 'philadelphia', 'wake', 'orlando', 'tragedy'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': "That's not to say you can't still go show your support and attend events such as Philly Pride, however.\nThe first pride parade was held in New York in 1970 to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the Stonewall riots with a celebration of acceptance and openness.\nPhiladelphia's 28th pride parade and festival was scheduled for Sunday, and it has not been cancelled because of the shooting.\nIf you are interested in attending, the pride festival is located at the Great Plaza at Penn's Landing, and wristbands are $15.\nFor those who aren't able to attend, there are lots of upcoming pride events in the month of June happening all over the country, most of which can be found here.", 'date': None}, {'text': 'Police have identified the gunman in the mass shooting at a gay club in Florida as 29-year-old Omar Mateen, an American citizen whose parents are from Afghanistan.\n\nAuthorities in Orlando said they were investigating the shooting as an act of terrorism, as the death toll rose to 50 with a further 53 wounded.\n\nThe gunman was killed in a shootout with armed officers at around 5am on Sunday morning, US time.

We weren\'t aware of any action he is taking. We are in shock like the whole country," Seddique said.\n\nOrlando police chief John Mina said the suspect exchanged gunfire with an officer working at the Pulse club at around 2am, before going inside and taking hostages among the more than 300 people at the club.\n\nAt a press conference, police declared a state of emergency in the city and urged anyone who went to Pulse on Saturday night to come forward and speak to police.\n\nRon Hopper, the FBI agent in charge of the operation, when asked if the gunman had a connection to radical Islamic terrorism, Hopper said authorities "have suggestions that individual has leanings towards that".\n\n"This is an incident, as I see it, that we certainly classify as domestic terror incident," Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said.\n\nBarack Obama was briefed on the attack and has asked for regular updates on the investigation, the White House said.\n\nIn pictures: Orlando nightclub shooting 30 show all In pictures: Orlando nightclub shooting 1/30 Friends and family grieve after a list of hospitalised victims was released, implying the death of those who weren\'t on the list and hadn\'t been heard from, outside a Hampton Inn & Suites hotel near the Orlando Regional Medical Center AP 2/30 People mourning for victims of the mass shooting near the Pulse gay nightclub in Orlando AFP/Getty Images 3/30 Mina Justice speaks to a reporter discussing texting with her son Eddie who was in a bathroom at Club Pulse in Orlando.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nThough so-called assault rifles account for a small fraction of the United States’ 30,000 annual gun deaths, they have been used in at least 10 mass shootings since 2011, according to a database compiled by Mother Jones magazine.\n\nThe prevalence of these firearms has made them a focal point in the debate over U.S. gun laws as opponents say civilians should not own what they describe as “weapons of war.” Backers say they are simply modern rifles enjoyed by millions of law-abiding Americans.\n\nIn December 2012, Adam Lanza used a Bushmaster XM15 to kill 28 children and adults at the Sandy Hook elementary school in Connecticut before taking his own life with a Glock pistol.\n\nTashfeen Malik and Syed Farook used two assault rifles and two pistols to kill 14 people in San Bernardino, California, in December 2015.\n\nJames Holmes carried an assault rifle, a shotgun and two pistols when he killed 12 people in a Colorado movie theater in 2012.\n\nLaw enforcement officials say Mateen, a 29-year-old U.S. citizen who was the son of Afghan immigrants, carried an AR-15 style assault rifle and a handgun when he killed 50 people and wounded 53 at a gay nightclub in Orlando. He also had an unidentified device, said Orlando Police Chief John Mina.\n\nThe AR-15 was developed from the U.S. military’s M-16 rifle, used in the Vietnam War in the 1960s. Unlike the military version, the AR-15 is not fully automatic, meaning users must pull the trigger each time they want to fire a shot. Like the military version, many AR-15s combine light weight with a relatively modest recoil.\n\nProminent manufacturers include Smith & Wesson, Sturm Ruger and Remington Arms Co, which faces a lawsuit from some families of Sandy Hook victims who say the rifle should not be sold to civilians.\n\n“It is the gold standard for killing the enemy in battle, just as it has become the gold standard for mass murder of innocent civilians,” said Josh Koskoff, a lawyer involved in the case.\n\nThe National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents gun manufacturers, said it would not comment on the Orlando shooting until more facts are known.\n\nTARGET SHOOTING AND HOME DEFENSE\n\nThe NSSF estimates there are roughly 5 million to 10 million AR-15 rifles owned in the United States, a fraction of the 300 million firearms owned by Americans. Most owners say they use the rifle for target shooting and home defense, although they can be used for hunting as well.\n\nDespite their controversial reputation, assault rifles do not often turn up at murder scenes. Handguns accounted for at least 48 percent of all murders between 2010 and 2014, according to FBI data, while rifles - a category that includes more traditional types of long guns - accounted for 2.4 percent. Roughly four times as many people were killed by knives in that period.\n\nStill, in the wake of the Orlando shooting several Democratic politicians said Congress should renew a ban on assault-style weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines that was in place between 1994 and 2004.\n\n“It reminds us once more that weapons of war have no place on our streets,” said presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nResearch is mixed on whether the assault-rifle ban had a significant impact. Gun manufacturers were able to tweak their designs to get around the ban and crime rates have fallen steadily since the early 1990s, whether or not the ban was in place. The number of mass shootings has increased since it expired.\n\nAny effort to renew the ban would face fierce opposition in the U.S. Congress, where Republicans who control both chambers of Congress have staunchly opposed tighter gun laws and groups like the National Rifle Association have been able to mobilize millions of gun owners against other restrictions. Despite strong support from President Barack Obama, the last attempt at new gun legislation failed in the U.S. Senate in 2013.\n\nOpinion polls find that Americans are less enthusiastic about banning assault weapons than other types of gun restrictions, such as expanded background checks. Several polls since 2013 have found between 44 percent and 57 percent of Americans back the idea.\n\nSix states and the District of Columbia currently ban assault weapons and two more, Minnesota and Virginia, ban possession by people under 18 years old. Experts say it is difficult to tell whether those laws have had an impact since gun buyers can easily find those weapons in other states.', 'title': 'Assault rifle used in Florida shooting drives gun control debate', 'url': 'https://www.reuters.com/article/us-florida-shooting-weapon-idUSKCN0YY13A', 'keywords': ['shooting', 'weapons', 'gun', 'florida', 'rifles', 'say', 'drives', 'assault', 'used', 'debate', 'ban', 'rifle', 'control', 'orlando'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Tashfeen Malik and Syed Farook used two assault rifles and two pistols to kill 14 people in San Bernardino, California, in December 2015.\nJames Holmes carried an assault rifle, a shotgun and two pistols when he killed 12 people in a Colorado movie theater in 2012.\nThe AR-15 was developed from the U.S. military’s M-16 rifle, used in the Vietnam War in the 1960s.\nThe National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents gun manufacturers, said it would not comment on the Orlando shooting until more facts are known.\nSix states and the District of Columbia currently ban assault weapons and two more, Minnesota and Virginia, ban possession by people under 18 years old.', 'date': 1465774366}, {'text': 'At least 50 people were killed and more than 30 hospitalized when a gunman opened fire at a nightclub in Orlando early Sunday morning.

Mateen has worked with G4S, a multinational private security firm since Sept. 10, 2007.\n\nG4S, one of the world’s largest security companies, provides security to nuclear power plants, oil and gas companies and it is a company of contractors used by the U.S. Government.\n\nAnd, its US headquarters are in Jupiter.\n\nA neighbor told CNN that Mateen’s job with the company was working as a security guard at the courthouse in Port St. Lucie where he staffed the metal detectors.\n\n3. Mateen’s former co-worker Daniel Gilroy, who was also a Fort Pierce Police officer, said Mateen was “unhinged and unstable,” according to TCPalm.\n\nGilroy said Mateen often made homophobic and racist comments when they worked together at G4S. He said he complained to his supervisors, but they did nothing because Mateen was Muslim, Gilroy said.\n\n“I quit because everything he said was toxic and the company wouldn’t do anything,” Gilroy told TCPalm. “This guy was unhinged and unstable. He talked of killing people.”\n\n4. Mateen’s father, Seddique Mateen, seems a little unhinged himself.\n\nHe said his son’s actions had nothing to do with religion, and was more likely tied to the outrage he felt after seeing two men kissing in Miami.\n\nMateen’s father is a strong supporter of the Afghan Taliban and can be seen voicing his support in scores of videos of a Dari-language show broadcast from California.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, just hours before the Orlando shooting, the elder Mateen posted a video to a Facebook page called “Provisional Government of Afghanistan — Seddique Mateen” in which he appears to be pretending to be the president of Afghanistan.\n\nIn the video he’s dressed in army fatigues and orders the arrests of half a dozen Afghan political figures.\n\n5. Omar Mateen was no lone wolf, he was a “known wolf.” He was investigated and questioned twice by the FBI.\n\nThe first time was in 2013 when co-workers claimed he was making inflammatory remarks and boasting of terrorist ties.\n\nThe second time was in 2014 when the FBI looked into his connection to Vero Beach’s Moner Mohammad Abu Salha, the first American suicide bomber in Syria.\n\nThe FBI didn’t find Mateen to be a threat either time and he wasn’t under investigation at the time of the attack.\n\n6. Mateen pledged allegiance to ISIS and ISIS pledged allegiance right back.\n\nThis is the first time ISIS has claimed responsibility for an attack on American soil.\n\nIn a 911 call made during the terror attack, Mateen talked to dispatchers and pledged his allegiance to ISIS, as well as talking about the Boston Marathon bombers.\n\nISIS later took responsibility for the attack.\n\n7. Only two months ago, Sheikh Farrokh Sekaleshfar, an imam speaking near Orlando said gays should be killed.\n\n“Out of compassion, let’s get rid of them now,” he said. “Death is the sentence… There’s nothing to be embarrassed about this. Death is the sentence.”\n\n8. Mateen’s ex-wife claims he used to beat her.

Latest reports indicate at least 50 people were killed and more than 50 have taken to the hospital following the mass shooting.\n\nAt least 22 gunshots in rapid succession can be heard in the video, which offers a glimpse into the terror unleashed early on Sunday by the gunman, identified as Omar Mir Seddique Mateen, 29, a U.S. citizen born in New York to Muslim parents of Afghan origin. Mateen lived in Fort Pierce, Florida, and was a licensed security officer with Statewide Firearms License, according to Fox News.\n\nThe footage, obtained by WESH 2 News, was reportedly taken by a witness standing in the street outside the Pulse club, off Orange Avenue and Kaley Street, on Sunday. It captures the sounds of at least 22 gunshots fired in seconds as the massacre, which is being described as the worst mass shooting in U.S. history, unfolded in the downtown LGBT bar.\n\nA few more shots can be heard after a pause and a woman screams. More shots can be heard towards the end of the video.\n\n“Oh… my god… People are getting shot dude…,” the person filming can be heard saying in shock.\n\n“We need to get out of here,” his companion says.\n\nBut the two did not leave.\n\n“This guy is firing out shots,” the companion of the person shooting the video speaks again.\n\nThe gunman, Omar Mateen, entered the Pulse nightclub at about 2:00 a.m. local time, armed with an assault rifle, a handgun, and a device believed to be an explosive.\n\nHe exchanged shots with an officer working at the club, who immediately called for back-up.\n\nThe incident became a hostage situation after officers arrived and tried to engage the assailant.\n\nAccording to Orlando Police Chief John Mina, a decision was taken at about 5 a.m. to rescue the hostages.\n\nExplosives experts set up a “controlled explosion” inside the club to distract the gunman as SWAT team members forced their way into the nightclub and exchange fire with the gunman.\n\nPolice confirmed at about 7:00 a.m. local time that the gunman was shot dead after the SWAT team entered the nightclub to rescue the hostages. The officers were able to rescue more than 30 people. But it was not clear how many of the hostages were killed in the midst of the rescue effort.\n\nPulse Shooting: The shooter inside the club is dead. — Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) June 12, 2016\n\nThat sound was a controlled explosion by law enforcement.

A witness, Rob Rick, said it was near closing time and there were about 100 people inside the club when the gunman entered.\n\nMany escaped through a backdoor after a club bouncer tore down the partition between the club and staff area.\n\nWitnesses also confirmed police statement that the gunman was “carrying a suicide vest.” He had a bomb strapped to his body at the time he entered the club, according to witnesses.\n\nPolice said they were investigating the shooting as an act of “domestic terrorism.” Police also said the gunman had “leanings to radical Islamic terrorism.”\n\nInvestigators will also try to determine whether the shooter acted as a lone wolf.\n\nThe shooting comes after the The Voice singer, 22-year-old Christina Grimmie, was shot dead on Friday at The Plaza in Orlando, only a few miles from the Pulse club.\n\nMeanwhile, President Barack Obama has been briefed about the incident by Lisa Monaco, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counter-terrorism.\n\n“Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of the victims,” the White House said in a statement released earlier today.\n\n“The President asked to receive regular updates as the FBI, and other federal officials, work with the Orlando Police to gather more information, and directed that the federal government provide any assistance necessary to pursue the investigation and support the community,” the statement added.\n\nGovernor Rick Scott has also pledged assistance to the victims of the shooting.\n\n“We are a strong and resilient state and we will devote every resource available to assist with the shooting in Orlando,” he said. “Our state emergency operations center is also monitoring this tragic incident.”\n\n[Photo by Phelan M.

Fuller noted the plan is still evolving and that changes may be made following meetings with city officials this week. Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper is scheduled to speak, while other officials such as Denver Mayor Michael Hancock (who spoke at an impromptu vigil at Tracks Denver nightclub on Sunday night) have yet to confirm an appearance.\n\n“(Sunday night) at the rally probably 10 or 12 politicians had been invited to attend, and probably 30 showed up and were on stage,” Fuller said. Additional vigils have already been scheduled for this week.\n\nPrideFest promises to be a much bigger event. The festival features various stages of live entertainment and more than 250 vendors and merchants offering arts, crafts, food and beverages, 11 a.m.-7 p.m. June 18 and 10 a.m.-6 p.m. June 19. As such, its organizers see it as an event that’s already in motion.\n\nAAron Ontiveroz, The Denver Post DENVER, CO - JUNE 12: From right, Grant Gilmore, Patrick Corley, Yvie Oddly and Josh Rocchio embrace one another as they listen to speakers at Tracks.

We’ve worked too hard and for too long to get where we are.”\n\nOne Colorado provides programming and other help to The Center for PrideFest, but The Center is ultimately responsible for its security and logistics. This year’s PrideFest will include a fence around Civic Center and an appeal to attendees to leave their coolers (a popular accessory) at home. Contrary to an Associated Press story, Fuller said PrideFest will not screen attendees with metal detectors.\n\n“It’s a three-acre outdoor park and logistically pretty difficult,” he said. “As we haven’t been faced with the need for this in past, it is not something that is in our current budget. It may also be a matter of availability — we’ve not had to learn if metal detectors are something we could even rent for the event. We have had no issues with the current system of bag searches. Keep in mind, we have not received any threats here in our community.”\n\nFuller noted not only has The Center’s staff received training in handling emergency situations, but an “extensive safety plan” is in place for Civic Center, including bag searches, a weapons ban, parade route and grounds inspections and “cops on every corner.”\n\nDespite that, past PrideFest attendees say it’s up to individuals to decide what’s best for them.\n\n“I’ve gotten so many emails from people this year saying, ‘Is it safe to go to Pride?’ And I don’t have an answer for people. You have to decide what’s going to feel safest,” said Sara Connell, education and services manager for Out Boulder. “For me, being visible and showing up is it. I need for myself to feel that this act of terror hasn’t scared us into being unable to show who we are. But I also respect people’s choice if they decide not to come. It’s a reasonable fear.”\n\nOut Boulder is running this year’s Longmont Pride festival on June 25. Connell said she expects last year’s attendance to double to more than 1,000. Before Longmont Pride, Out Boulder will also open its first Longmont location on the city’s main street on June 24, with Longmont’s mayor and other allies expected to show support.\n\n“These events are about unifying the community,” said Jordan Weileba, a transgender comedian who is co-hosting the third annual Women’s Fest inside Denver PrideFest this weekend. “Our bonds are deeply rooted in the fact that everybody has to overcome some sort of adversity or bigotry or hate, and in light of recent events, this weekend will be even more of a celebration.”\n\nThe events in Florida could have happened anywhere, a chilling thought to some but a reminder that Denver is no more vulnerable than anywhere else, said Patrick Brown.\n\n“I appreciate that they’re tightening up security, but there’s no question in my mind that I’ll be going,” said Brown, the general manager at Twist & Shout record store. “It just drives home the homophobia in our society, but we can’t let go of our safe spaces.”\n\nCOUNSELING RESOURCES\n\nFor people feeling anxious or traumatized by the Orlando shooting, there are a number of counseling and mental health options available in Denver and Boulder.\n\nThe GLBT Community Center of Colorado (“The Center”) is offering mental health counseling at its 1301 E. Colfax Ave. headquarters 3-6 p.m. June 13 and 5-7 p.m. on June 14. 303-733-7743 or glbtcolorado.org.\n\nPFLAG is the long-running support and education group for parents and friends of LGBT people, with a current emphasis on the Latino transgender community in Denver.

The Associated Press\n\nThe massacre at a gay nightclub that left at least 50 people dead on Sunday morning has reignited the debate in Congress over legislation that would prevent people on the federal terrorist no-fly list from purchasing firearms.\n\nOmar Mateen, the alleged gunman who stormed into Pulse, a club in Orlando, Florida, and opened fire with an assault rifle, had twice been under federal investigation for possible ties to terrorism. He was eventually taken off the FBI\'s watch list after it was determined he had broken no laws.\n\nBut at no time – even when he was included on the FBI\'s Terrorist Screening Database – would Mateen have been barred from buying a gun.\n\nLast December, after a couple inspired by Islamic State group ideology killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California, Democrats on Capitol Hill pushed legislation that would prohibit anyone on the no-fly list from purchasing firearms.\n\nRepublicans blocked the bill, on the grounds that those on no-fly lists are merely under suspicion and haven\'t been accused or convicted of crimes.\n\nAfter the slaughter in Orlando, the proposal was among the first mentioned by Congressional Democrats and Hillary Clinton, their party\'s presumptive presidential nominee.\n\n"The legislation Republicans blocked, the so-called no-fly list [loophole], would have prevented suspected terrorists from buying guns," Clinton said Monday on NBC. "It allows the FBI and the attorney general from preventing a suspected terrorist from doing that. It would happen on a case-by-case basis."\n\nThe former secretary of state, who also called for the reinstatement of an expired ban on assault weapons, said the National Rifle Association – arguably the nation\'s most powerful lobbying organization – has cowed elected officials into inaction on laws that would prevent dangerous people from getting their hands on firearms.\n\nMass Shooting at Orlando Nightclub View All 31 Images\n\n"We cannot fall into the trap set by the gun lobby that says if you can\'t stop every shooting and every incident you should not try to stop any," she said.\n\nClinton\'s call echoed those in Congress who said they would push to bring the no-fly list loophole bill up for a vote again.\n\n"Tomorrow, when we return to Washington, we should have a moment of silence for the victims – immediately followed by a vote to close the loophole that allows people on the terror watch list to buy assault rifles – or any weapon," said Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., in a statement Sunday. "This isn\'t politics; it\'s common sense."\n\n"In the weeks to come, we should not be afraid to ask why, when an AR-15 assault rifle is the one thing that\'s common to Orlando, San Bernardino and Newtown, we allow these deadly weapons to be freely available?" Deutch said. "And why every gun purchaser isn\'t subject to a background check? And why the mental health crisis isn\'t urgently addressed?"\n\nRepublicans opposed to the legislation say using the list for gun background checks would unfairly punish law-law abiding citizens, since the list includes those for whom investigators have not been able to find sufficient evidence for arrest or prosecution.\n\n"The majority of the people on the no-fly list are oftentimes people that just basically have the same name as somebody else, who doesn\'t belong on the no-fly list," Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., then a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, said on CNN in December. "Former Sen. Ted Kennedy once said he was on a no-fly list. There are journalists on the no-fly list."\n\nBeyond the terrorist watch list bill, Democrats used Sunday\'s shootings to call again for stronger gun-safety laws.\n\nIn his statement, Deutch ticked off the other anti-gun violence measures on Democrats\' wish list, including expanding background checks for those who want to buy a gun. At the same time, polls show the vast majority of Americans support universal background checks for gun buyers.\n\nAnd Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., planned to roll out a bill that would block anyone convicted of a hate crime from buying a gun.\n\n"If you have proven you will commit criminal acts based on hate, you absolutely should not have access to a gun. It\'s common sense," Senator Casey said. "It is time we as members of Congress do something. If you are a member of Congress and you say you care about security then you have to take steps to keep guns out of the wrong hands and ensure our law enforcement has the resources needed to keep communities safe."\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., has been a leading advocate of tightening gun control laws since 26 people, including 20 young children, were slaughtered at Sandy Hook Elementary School in his home state in 2012. On Sunday, Murphy said members of Congress who have failed to act share the blame for the deaths of the victims Sunday, and the the thousands of others killed by guns every year.\n\n"The phenomenon of near constant mass shootings happens only in America – nowhere else," Murphy said in a statement. "Congress has become complicit in these murders by its total, unconscionable, deafening silence. This doesn\'t have to happen, but his epidemic will continue without end if Congress continues to sit on its hands and do nothing."', 'title': "Democrats: 'No-Fly, No-Buy' Gun Bill Could Have Prevented Orlando Killings", 'url': 'https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-06-13/democrats-no-fly-no-buy-gun-bill-could-have-prevented-orlando-killings', 'keywords': ['gun', 'killings', 'legislation', 'nobuy', 'prevented', 'democrats', 'terrorist', 'buying', 'congress', 'nofly', 'list', 'orlando', 'bill'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': '"The legislation Republicans blocked, the so-called no-fly list [loophole], would have prevented suspected terrorists from buying guns," Clinton said Monday on NBC.\nClinton\'s call echoed those in Congress who said they would push to bring the no-fly list loophole bill up for a vote again.\n"The majority of the people on the no-fly list are oftentimes people that just basically have the same name as somebody else, who doesn\'t belong on the no-fly list," Sen.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said in a statement, using an acronym for Islamic State.\n\nIntelligence officers were looking at terrorism databases to see if there are any known links between the gunman and a terrorist group, Schiff said.\n\nChristopher Hansen, who was inside the Pulse nightclub during the attack, said he dropped to the floor when he heard about 40 gunshots. People ran from the bar as police officers screamed for everyone to leave.\n\n“I just fell down and crawled out,” said Hansen, 23.\n\n“I helped someone who was on the ground. I wasn’t sure if he was dead or alive,” he said.\n\nPolice Chief John Mina said Mateen fired the first shot about 2 a.m. at an Orlando police officer, and then ran into the club, which held more than 200 people. Details about exactly what happened inside the club were unclear, but police handled it as a hostage situation.\n\nBy 5 a.m., the police department’s SWAT team opened fire. They distracted Mateen with an explosive device and plowed into the building with a vehicle. When officers went inside, they found 50 dead, including Mateen, and 53 injured.\n\nMina said nine officers were involved in the shooting, and one sustained an injury to his eye and was saved by his helmet.\n\nMina credited his officers with rescuing 30 hostages from the club, which is just south of downtown Orlando.\n\nOrlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared the city in “a state of emergency” and Gov. Rick Scott, who was at the scene, extended it to all of Orange County.\n\nU.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., called the attack a “hate crime” because the shooting happened at a gay club.\n\n“It’s no coincidence the attack took place where it did and when it did,” he said.\n\nMina said some people trapped inside the club hid in the bathrooms and called 911.\n\nChristopher Hansen, who was inside the Pulse nightclub during the attack, said he dropped to the floor when he heard about 40 gunshots.

Everyone was getting on the floor,” Feba said. “I told her I didn’t think it was real, I thought it was just part of the music, until I saw fire coming out of his gun.”\n\nFeba and her girlfriend ran out of the club. On the way out, they saw a man who had been shot.\n\nFeba grabbed him. Others around her called 911. Some of the man’s blood stained the sleeve of her striped T-shirt.\n\nFeba and her girlfriend were unharmed, but shaken. They waited in a CVS parking lot for more information.\n\nHe said the immediate priority is to identify the dead and injured and notify their next of kin, something that he said would require people to be patient.\n\n“Unfortunately this tragedy and the amount of bodies that are in there, the amount of victims, is going to take some time,” Mina said.\n\nMeanwhile, authorities scoured the area for explosive devices, using robotic devices and dogs.\n\nImam Muhammad Musri, president of the Islamic Society of Central Florida, urged people to pray on what he called “a heartbreaking morning.”\n\n“It’s a horrible tragedy.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nThe red flags that checkered Omar Mateen\'s life — a pair of FBI investigations, alarms raised by family and former colleagues — stacked up over the years.\n\nAnd yet, Mateen was able to legally buy an AR 15-style rifle and a 9mm handgun just days before he carried out one of the deadliest shooting massacres in modern U.S. history.\n\nThere was a disconnect between the warning signs in Mateen\'s recent past and the ease of his ability to buy powerful weapons. It deepens the tragedy of his shooting spree at an Orlando gay night club over the weekend, which claimed the lives of 49 innocent people and wounded 53 more. But even in hindsight, few barriers would have likely prevented the gunman from carrying out the attack.\n\nOrlando Police identified the suspect in the Pulse Nightclub shootings as Omar Mateen, 29, a U.S. citizen born in New York. via Orlando Police\n\nIn this new era of homegrown terrorism and mass shootings, there are glaring gaps in the United States’ model used to combat the full spectrum of extremism. Federal authorities frequently keep tabs on a network of individuals identified as potential terrorist sympathizers. Yet there\'s no universal approach toward de-escalating extremism outside of the criminal justice system. Short of catching a person actively conspiring to break the law, options are limited for families or even law enforcement to intervene before it\'s too late.\n\nFederal agents launched a 10-month investigation into Mateen in 2013 for espousing Islamic propaganda at work. They opened a second inquiry just months after the previous one concluded, probing a potential link to an American citizen-turned suicide bomber in Syria. The FBI’s conclusion: 29-year-old Mateen, born in New York, did not pose as a violent threat.\n\nRelated: Portrait of a Killer: Who Was Orlando Nightclub Shooter Omar Mateen?\n\nFBI Director James Comey said on Monday that while he stood behind his agency’s preliminary assessment into Mateen’s past, it’s exceedingly difficult to predict who among the many individuals on their radar would actually turn to violence. Mateen’s own motivations appear contradictory and not purely faith based — the gunman once claimed to be linked to two radical groups that violently oppose one another.\n\n"We\'re looking for needles in a nationwide haystack. But we\'re also called upon to figure out which pieces of hay might someday become needles," FBI Director James Comey said during a press conference on Monday. "That is hard work."\n\nThe case exposes the pitfalls in combating “lone wolf” attacks on U.S. soil, tactics that, while encouraged by ISIS leaders, may or may not have direct ties to terrorism overseas. It becomes a slippery slope for policy makers when the potential perpetrators of attacks are American citizens.\n\nFederal authorities have charged 88 people on terror-related offenses over the last two years, a significant rise in arrests unlike anything seen before. The vast majority of those charged were U.S. citizens or permanent residents.\n\nIn an exhaustive study of American recruits lured by terrorist groups, Seamus Hughes, an expert in homegrown extremism at George Washington University, found there was no clear profile to predict which individuals were likely to act on their extreme opinions and which were merely making a cry for help.\n\nRelated: Dealer Who Sold Orlando Massacre Guns: \'I Don\'t Make the Laws\'\n\nThis creates a minefield of difficulties for law enforcement trying to walk a very fine line between taking an aggressive approach to counter terrorism and respecting the rights and civil liberties of American citizens.\n\n"Our law enforcement are put into this untenable position of trying to prevent every single attack when you\'re never going to know what\'s in someone\'s mind," Hughes said. "How do you traverse those very difficult issues, especially in a country with a free society?"\n\nIntertwined with the policy shortfalls is a contentious political debate over how to combat terrorism and gun violence. Suspected terror sympathizers can be placed under federal surveillance or on a no-fly list. Still, virtually nothing prevents them from legally obtaining a gun.\n\nThe Senate failed to pass an amendment in December that would have excluded suspected terrorists from buying guns and explosives. The stalemate mirrors other failed legislative efforts to strengthen background checks in the wake of equally devastating shooting tragedies in recent years.\n\nPresident Obama has used the waning days of his second term to sharpen his criticism of policy inaction on gun violence, repeatedly raising the risk that existing gun laws did little to prevent suspected terrorists from loading up on legal firearms.\n\nIn fact, earlier this month, Obama came eerily close to predicting the exact circumstances that led up to Orlando\'s mass shooting.\n\nAsked about gun control at a PBS town hall, Obama recounted a scene inside the Situation Room from just earlier that day. The FBI had identified a number of people, including U.S. citizens, who were active on websites associated with terror groups. Yet their hands were tied in ensuring those individuals could not become more dangerous.\n\n"This is somebody who is a known ISIL (ISIS) sympathizer," Obama said. "And if he wants to walk into a gun store or a gun show right now and buy as much — as many weapons and ammo as he can, nothing\'s prohibiting him from doing that, even though the FBI knows who that person is."', 'title': 'FBI Watch List Not Enough to Prevent Another Orlando-Type Attack', 'url': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/orlando-nightclub-massacre/glaring-gaps-how-u-s-combats-homegrown-terrorism-n591576', 'keywords': ['prevent', 'mateen', 'american', 'individuals', 'gun', 'orlandotype', 'orlando', 'mateens', 'fbi', 'law', 'attack', 'obama', 'watch', 'list', 'terrorism'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': "The red flags that checkered Omar Mateen's life — a pair of FBI investigations, alarms raised by family and former colleagues — stacked up over the years.\nBut even in hindsight, few barriers would have likely prevented the gunman from carrying out the attack.\nOrlando Police identified the suspect in the Pulse Nightclub shootings as Omar Mateen, 29, a U.S. citizen born in New York.\nIntertwined with the policy shortfalls is a contentious political debate over how to combat terrorism and gun violence.\nThe FBI had identified a number of people, including U.S. citizens, who were active on websites associated with terror groups.", 'date': None}, {'text': "Buddy Dyer, the Orlando mayor, said Mateen drove around several locations in the Orlando area Saturday evening, before he picked Pulse.\n\n“What I know concretely is that he was driving around that evening and visited several locations,” Dyer said.

Witnesses said Mateen had visited the Pulse club as a guest several times over the past three years and interacted with men on gay dating apps. His ex-wife, Sitora Yusufiy, told CNN it was possible he had hidden feelings about being gay.\n\nIt has led experts to question whether the gunman was spurred on - at least in part - by a powerful self-loathing about his own sexuality. Could he have been driven to hate and hurt others because he hated himself?\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jim Van Horn, Pulse nightclub customer: "He (Omar Mateen) was a homosexual and he was trying to pick up men"\n\n"Although it is not common, it\'s not unheard of for people to be violent to other people who are LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) as part of overcompensating for something that they are struggling with themselves," says Genevieve Weber, who has specialised in counselling people affected by internalised homophobia and now teaches counselling at Hofstra University in New York.\n\n"It\'s could be part of the notion, \'If I differentiate myself enough, I can\'t be gay\'."\n\nDefinitions of internalised homophobia vary, but it is essentially when LGBT individuals encounter negative beliefs in society towards the LGBT community, absorb those beliefs and accept them to be true.\n\nResearchers say it happens involuntarily, and while Mateen would be a very extreme example, it is an issue that affects many LGBT individuals at some time in their lives.\n\nImage caption Omar Mateen\'s ex-wife says he enjoyed clubbing and nightlife but that he did not want people to know that about him\n\n"It\'s a really simple concept unfortunately," says Ilan Meyer, a senior scholar for public policy and sexual orientation law at the University of California, Los Angeles. "All members of society are taught about conventions. We learn about stigma and prejudices about certain groups from a very young age.\n\n"So when a person begins to recognise that he or she is gay or lesbian, there is already that negativity."\n\nMessages about homosexuality can come from multiple places, including family, school and the media, experts say.\n\nIntolerance can be covertly communicated, perhaps through slurs or pejorative statements such as "that\'s so gay", or overtly, such as bullying or anti-gay teachings in religions that do not accept LGBT rights.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption A man cries during a prayer against homophobia at a church in California, one of an increasing number of places of worship that are more open to LGBT people\n\n"There are many religions that are not homophobic," says Meyer. "But in some cases, when you are religious and you hear negative messages repeatedly from people who are the most valued in your community it is going to be a very painful lesson.\n\n"Certainly in the evangelical Christian community in the US, for example, if you went to church every week you could learn horrible things."\n\nSohail Ahmed, a young Muslim man from London, says his struggles with his own sexuality led him to become increasingly extreme in his religious views - to the extent that he even considered staging a terrorist attack.\n\n"I would research all these Islamic verdicts on what you should do if you have homosexual feelings," he told the BBC\'s World Service.\n\n"One thing would keep coming up again and again was that you need to be more religious, worship more.\n\n"It sounds really paradoxical… but I actually became more radical in an attempt to cure myself of homosexuality."\n\nAhmed says he hid his true sexuality from everyone he knew, and even began to believe he was "evil".\n\n"I started thinking maybe I was gay as a punishment from God for something I had done. It was an absolutely horrifying feeling - waking up every day with this voice at the back of your head saying you\'re disgusting, you\'re evil.\n\n"It was this endless cycle. It just increased my hatred for myself and other gay people. It was extremely destructive."\n\nAhmed later denounced his extremist views and now helps others turn away from radicalism. He has come out as gay and follows a progressive branch of Islam that accepts LGBT people.\n\nBut experts warn that internalised homophobia can also have a harmful impact on a person\'s mental health. It can cause depression and anxiety, leave people feeling unable to form intimate relationships, and lead them to make unsafe choices.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption BBC Pop Up helped Florida residents create a video message to the global gay community\n\n"Internalised homophobia is not in itself a mental health problem, but it causes mental health problems," says Meyer.\n\n"Certainly if you\'re dealing with that very hard period to accept yourself, it is very stressful. It can lead to drug or alcohol abuse. You might use drugs during sex to numb yourself to what you\'re doing."\n\nPeople affected need to understand it is a condition that can be worked through, says Genevieve Weber.\n\n"With the right help from a counsellor or someone that really understands, people can be brought to the point where they love themselves and realise there is a whole community who will support them."\n\nBoth Weber and Meyer say educating society as a whole is crucial to enabling people to avoid developing internalised homophobia and its potentially damaging effects.\n\n"School environments need to not only be accepting, but also teach kids about gay and lesbian society," says Meyer. He also encourages anyone who might be struggling with their sexuality to look for positive stories and images online.\n\nWeber says it is important that the right help is at hand. "It\'s about having people in roles where they are showing acceptance, and ensuring that you have clinicians trained in understanding the issues who are accessible to people."\n\nIt is not yet known for certain whether Mateen experienced internalised homophobia - and whether he ever tried to get support.\n\nFor his part, Meyer says there is not enough research to prove a direct link between internalised homophobia and violent behaviour.\n\n"But I know that Mateen would not be the first person to display homophobia internally and externally."\n\nExamples could include instances where conservative, anti-LGBT politicians have been "outed" by the media as gay or lesbian, he says.\n\nBut when it comes to the Orlando gunman, this is one of many questions that remain unanswered.', 'title': 'Did internalised homophobia spark Orlando nightclub attack?', 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36534693', 'keywords': ['gay', 'mateen', 'society', 'sexuality', 'internalised', 'youre', 'spark', 'nightclub', 'attack', 'media', 'homophobia', 'meyer', 'lgbt', 'orlando'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': "Image copyright ReutersReports that Orlando gunman Omar Mateen had been a regular at the gay nightclub he attacked and used gay dating apps have led to speculation that he was motivated by internalised homophobia.\nBut experts warn that internalised homophobia can also have a harmful impact on a person's mental health.\nBoth Weber and Meyer say educating society as a whole is crucial to enabling people to avoid developing internalised homophobia and its potentially damaging effects.\nIt is not yet known for certain whether Mateen experienced internalised homophobia - and whether he ever tried to get support.\nFor his part, Meyer says there is not enough research to prove a direct link between internalised homophobia and violent behaviour.", 'date': None}, {'text': "US law enforcement authorities on Monday lowered the death toll from the weekend massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, to 49, the deadliest mass shooting in American history, explaining that the shooter had been counted in the original tally.\n\n“We don’t include the shooter as a victim,” FBI special agent Paul Wysopal told an early morning press conference, revising the toll.\n\nIn the early hours of Sunday, Omar Seddique Mateen, a 29-year-old New York native and son of Afghan immigrants, burst into the Pulse nightclub and opened fire.

He attended school here, worked here and his whole life was here,” he said.\n\nHe described the atrocity as an “unbelievable act” that had left his family devastated and confused.\n\n“If he was alive we could ask why he did this. He never showed any signs of mental illness or links to extremist groups,” he said. “No father or family should ever have to go through this kind pain.”\n\nEarlier in the video, he describes his son as “a very good and well-educated son with a wife and a child”.\n\nTwenty minutes into the massacre, Omar Mateen made a 911 call in which he reportedly referred both to Islamic State and the Tsarnaevs, the brothers who carried out the Boston Marathon bombings in April 2013.\n\n\n\nIn his interview, his father told the Guardian: “I don’t know if he had any connections to Isis.”\n\nSeddique Mateen also played down the significance of his widely reported remarks in a previous interview in which he recounted how his son had once become enraged at the sight of two men kissing.\n\n“We were in downtown Miami, Bayside, people were playing music. And he saw two men kissing each other in front of his wife and kid, and he got very angry,” Seddique Mateen told NBC. “They were kissing each other and touching each other, and he said, ‘Look at that. In front of my son, they are doing that.’ And then we were in the men’s bathroom, and men were kissing each other.”\n\nHowever, in his interview with the Guardian, Seddique Mateen indicated he believed the importance of the incident had been overblown. “But that was a couple of months ago and he never talked about it afterwards,” he said. “I don’t think that incident would trigger this kind of violent reaction.”\n\nQueer Muslims exist – and we are in mourning too Read more\n\nSeddique Mateen’s own political views, including his occasional support of the Taliban – as expressed in internet videos – have come under close scrutiny since his son was identified as the gunman behind the shooting.\n\nHe previously hosted a TV show on a California-based channel for the Afghan diaspora called Payam-e-Afghan.\n\nA source at the channel said it decided to stop using Seddique Mateen as a host about a year ago. In one of his recent videos on Facebook, Seddique Mateen is dressed in military fatigue and sitting next to an Afghan flag, acting as if he is the president of Afghanistan.\n\nSeddique Mateen tells “revolutionaries of Afghanistan” that they are “strong enough to overthrow” the current leaders and US-backed government of Afghanistan.\n\nAsked about the controversy surrounding those online videos, Seddique Mateen told the Guardian they were were performances intended to convey his activist message. “I’m just defending Afghanistan,” he said. “Everyone knows that Pakistan is taking our land.”\n\nHe added that he could not be held responsible for his son’s actions. “You can have a child, send them to school and hope they grow up to be responsible adults,” he said. “What he does and what he did, he was an adult.”", 'title': "Orlando gunman’s father condemns atrocity but says 'punishment' for gay people is up to God", 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/13/orlando-gunmans-father-condemns-atrocity-but-says-punishment-for-gay-people-is-up-to-god', 'keywords': ['gunmans', 'gay', 'mateen', 'told', 'interview', 'god', 'punishment', 'condemns', 'atrocity', 'seddique', 'video', 'afghanistan', 'omar', 'father', 'son', 'orlando'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': "Seddique Mateen condemns son for nightclub attack and appears to suggest it is for God to enact punishment on gay peopleOrlando gunman’s father condemns atrocity but says 'punishment' for gay people is up to GodThe father of the Orlando gunman, Omar Mateen, has posted a video in which he condemns the atrocity committed by his son but then appears to suggest it is for God to enact “punishment” against gay people.\nOn the topic of being hamjensbazi, punishment and the things that they do, God will give the punishment.\nAnd he saw two men kissing each other in front of his wife and kid, and he got very angry,” Seddique Mateen told NBC.\nA source at the channel said it decided to stop using Seddique Mateen as a host about a year ago.\nAsked about the controversy surrounding those online videos, Seddique Mateen told the Guardian they were were performances intended to convey his activist message.", 'date': 1465776000}, {'text': 'Please enable cookies on your web browser in order to continue.\n\nThe new European data protection law requires us to inform you of the following before you use our website:\n\nWe use cookies and other technologies to customize your experience, perform analytics and deliver personalized advertising on our sites, apps and newsletters and across the Internet based on your interests.

"The place where they were attacked is more than a nightclub — it is a place of solidarity and empowerment where people have come together to raise awareness, to speak their minds, and to advocate for their civil rights."\n\nHe called the attack "an attack on all of us."\n\n"No act of hate or terror will ever change who we are or the values that make us Americans," Obama said.\n\nWhile he did not explicitly call for more gun control measures, the president said the shooting underscores how easy it is for people in the United States to obtain deadly weapons.\n\n"The shooter was apparently armed with a handgun and a powerful assault rifle," Obama said. "This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub. And we have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well."\n\nObama urged Americans to say a prayer for the victims and their families.\n\n"God give them the strength to bear the unbearable," he said.\n\nAmericans, he added, "will not give into fear or turn against each other."\n\n"As we go together, we will draw inspiration from heroic and selfless acts — friends who helped friends, took care of each other and saved lives," the president said. "In the face of hate and violence, we will love one another."\n\nObama issued a proclamation Sunday honoring the victims of the attack and ordering U.S. flags to be flown at half-staff at the White House and all public buildings and military bases until sundown Thursday.

(AP) - A gunman opened fire in a crowded gay dance club in Orlando, Florida, early Sunday morning, leaving at least 50 people dead and 53 injured in the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. Authorities identified the attacker as Omar Mateen, of Port St. Lucie man who was killed by SWAT officers. The previous deadliest mass shooting in the U.S. was the 2007 attack at Virginia Tech, in which a student killed 32 people before killing himself.\n\nHere's a look at some of the nation's deadliest rampages since 2012:\n\n- Feb. 25, 2016: Cedric Ford, 38, killed three people and wounded 14 others lawnmower factory where he worked in the central Kansas community of Hesston. The local police chief killed him during a shootout with 200 to 300 workers still in the building, authorities said.\n\n- Feb. 20, 2016: Jason Dalton, 45, is accused of randomly shooting and killing six people and severely wounding two others during a series of attacks over several hours in the Kalamazoo, Michigan, area. Authorities say he paused between shootings to make money as an Uber driver. He faces murder and attempted murder charges.\n\n- Dec. 2, 2015: Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and Tashfeen Malik, 27, opened fire at a social services center in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people and wounding more than 20. They fled the scene but died hours later in a shootout with police.\n\n- Oct. 1, 2015: A shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, left 10 people dead and seven wounded. Shooter Christopher Harper-Mercer, 26, exchanged gunfire with police, then killed himself.\n\n- June 17, 2015: Dylann Roof, 21, shot and killed nine African-American church members during a Bible study group inside the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Police contend the attack was racially motivated. Roof faces nine counts of murder in state court and dozens of federal charges, including hate crimes.\n\n- May 23, 2014: A community college student, Elliot Rodger, 22, killed six people and wounded 13 in shooting and stabbing attacks in the area near the University of California, Santa Barbara, campus. Authorities said he apparently shot himself to death after a gunbattle with deputies.\n\n- Sept. 16, 2013: Aaron Alexis, a mentally disturbed civilian contractor, shot 12 people to death at the Washington Navy Yard before he was killed in a police shootout.\n\n- July 26, 2013: Pedro Vargas, 42, went on a shooting rampage at his Hialeah, Florida, apartment building, gunning down six people before officers fatally shot him.\n\n- Dec. 14, 2012: In Newtown, Connecticut, an armed 20-year-old man entered Sandy Hook Elementary School and used a semi-automatic rifle to kill 26 people, including 20 first graders and six adult school staff members. He then killed himself.\n\n- Sept. 27, 2012: In Minnesota's deadliest workplace rampage, Andrew Engeldinger, who had just been fired, pulled a gun and fatally shot six people, including the company's founder. He also wounded two others at Accent Signage Systems in Minneapolis before taking his own life.\n\n- Aug. 5, 2012: In Oak Creek, Wisconsin, 40-year-old gunman Wade Michael Page killed six worshippers at a Sikh Temple before killing himself.\n\n- July 20, 2012: James Holmes, 27, fatally shot 12 people and injured 70 in an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole.\n\n- April 2, 2012: Seven people were killed and three were wounded when a 43-year-old former student opened fire at Oikos University in Oakland, California. One Goh was charged with seven counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder, but psychiatric evaluations concluded he suffered from long-term paranoid schizophrenia and was unfit to stand trial.\n\nhttp://wkrn.com/tag/orlando-nightclub-shooting/", 'title': 'Deadliest mass shootings in recent US history', 'url': 'https://www.wkrn.com/news/florida-nightclub-attack-just-the-latest-us-mass-shooting/1091549998', 'keywords': ['shooting', 'wounded', 'mass', 'orlando', 'murder', 'killed', 'deadliest', '2016', 'authorities', 'recent', 'killing', 'shot', '20', 'history', 'shootings'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Authorities identified the attacker as Omar Mateen, of Port St. Lucie man who was killed by SWAT officers.\nThe previous deadliest mass shooting in the U.S. was the 2007 attack at Virginia Tech, in which a student killed 32 people before killing himself.\nThe local police chief killed him during a shootout with 200 to 300 workers still in the building, authorities said.\nAuthorities say he paused between shootings to make money as an Uber driver.\n- July 20, 2012: James Holmes, 27, fatally shot 12 people and injured 70 in an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater.', 'date': 1465744590}, {'text': 'When I was 18 years old, I had my first kiss with a woman in the bathroom of an LGBT club.\n\nAfter months of secretly watching The L Word in my dorm room (and one thigh brush in a women’s studies class), I’d asked some friends to go to the ‘gay village’ with me in my college town “just because.”\n\nAnd there, while the music from my first drag show boomed through the walls, Jess and I locked lips. Everything was different after that.\n\nEarly Sunday morning, 30 people were held hostage in the bathroom of an LGBT club more than 2,000 miles away from the one where I shared that sweet and nervous moment.\n\nWhile they cowered in fear and blood, Omar Mateen was “cool and calm” negotiating with police over their lives.\n\nMateen entered Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida with an arsenal of weapons. He then used an AR-15 to murder 49 innocent people and injure another 53. Five of them remained in “grave” condition Monday afternoon. We now know most of the deceased’s names, and moving details of their tragically, violently abbreviated lives.\n\nYesterday, President Obama called Pulse—now infamously known for the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history—"more than a nightclub.”\n\nGay clubs are places, he said, of “solidarity and empowerment, where people have come together to raise awareness and speak their minds and advocate for their civil rights.”\n\nYes, they are those places. They have to fight hard to survive, in an age of apps, online dating, and rising rents. And thank goodness they do.\n\nEarly Sunday morning at Pulse, friends and lovers were drinking, dancing, and catching up when Mateen entered on his murderous mission.\n\nSoon those same patrons ran, screamed and cowered in fear as more than 100 of them were peppered with gunshots.\n\nThe safety of the space that was home to frivolity just minutes earlier had disappeared completely. A dancefloor, likely filled—as so many are—with piña coladas and music and flashing lights, was suddenly home to a cacophony of cellphones ringing as family tried to reach the dead. Paramedics asked the living to raise their hands from underneath their friends’ and partners’ corpses.\n\n“Gay bars and clubs are supposed to be our safe haven,” Vinny Milack-Carrasco, 48, told The New York Times at the Stonewall Inn on Sunday evening. “I’ve never felt threatened here, but now I’m looking over my shoulder.”\n\nStonewall has long been the mothership, the mecca, for queer Americans looking to remember the rebellion that changed history in June 1969.\n\nA police raid that sticky summer evening, as now-68-year-old rioter Martin Boyce told NPR last month, “sounded like screaming and real cries of agony and desperation finally being released.” Boyce said that “what we used to normally do at the time was look at the raid, see people coming out, who got arrested, and be glad it wasn’t you.”\n\nThe community had for years endured violence in the form of police raids on gay bars and in the middle of the street.\n\n“It was so much violence up to that time on the part of the police, so much discrimination,” Boyce said. “We bore it all. We didn’t think we could have a riot. We didn’t think we could change anything. But that night was so different.”\n\nOn New Year’s Eve of 1966, police attacked revelers at Los Angeles’ Black Cat, bashing them on their bodies with billy clubs. Another bar that night, New Faces, was hit when some ran to safety there, writes Slate’s June Thomas. A bartender suffered a ruptured spleen and was charged with assaulting an officer.\n\n“The New Year kisses led to six men being charged with lewd conduct. All of them were found guilty,” Thomas wrote.\n\nThis charged political history has taken place alongside thousands, maybe millions, of people finding themselves and finding each other, in the very same places.\n\nLGBT bars have been where, over rainbow floor tiles, I’ve whirled to Robyn and Lady Gaga and Beyoncé. But they were also the home of my first kisses, first dances, and first phone numbers received and given as a queer woman.\n\nAs soon as I left those rainbow and glitter-filled hallowed halls, I faced catcalls and harassment for just holding hands with a woman. Being outed meant that I could also be fired. In those spaces, I was able to be myself without fear and without terror.\n\nSometimes they were the places where I traded numbers I knew I’d never act on. Sometimes they were the beginnings of friendships over drinks. Sometimes they were where relationships began.\n\nThese were the only places where I felt safe and whole and known, and the fact that I never had to hold Kat or Stephanie or Michelle or Natalia as they bled to death feels now like a matter of luck and nothing more.\n\nI owe a part of my identity and the beginning of many relationships to those spaces in Austin. Probably a few hangovers, too.\n\nDozens of gay bars in New York City alone have attracted historical queer figures (closeted and otherwise).\n\nSeveral establishments claim to be America’s first or oldest gay bar. White Horse Inn in Oakland, California turned 83 last month. Others also claim the title, including Cafe Lafitte In Exile in New Orleans and Atlantic House in Provincetown, Massachusetts.\n\nWhile gay clubs have always been a place to experience peace in a world of fear, they have also been a known quantity for those who would do us harm. And the history of our battle for civil rights can in no small part be measured on our dancefloors.\n\nThirty-two people died in 1973, when an arsonist set fire to a gay bar in the French Quarter called the Upstairs Lounge.\n\nIn 2000, 43-year-old Danny Overstreet was killed and six others were injured after Ronald Gay shot up a gay bar in Roanoke, Virginia. Gay reportedly took offense at being teased about his name. (His ex-wife also had a same-sex relationship before their marriage.)\n\nGay told officials that he’d made it his mission to force all LGBT folks to move to San Francisco. He said he thought it would cure AIDS.\n\nOther attacks, successful and not, have occurred intermittently throughout history, with what seems like less and less frequency each year.\n\nPlaces like the Stonewall have gone from being sites of police raids and violence transforming into (for the most part) safe havens for LGBT folks young and old.\n\nTo everyone who’s ever shared the dance floor or bar with me at Oilcan Harry’s, or Rain, or Cheer Up Charlie’s (and many others) in Austin, Texas and to every other gay bar or club in this country: I grieve with you for the lost lives and for the victims and for the witnesses and the emergency response workers who will never be the same.\n\nI grieve also for a lost sense of safety we will have to fight to recover in these places—our bars—that used to be somewhere we could call home.\n\nIt is 2016—so far from 1969, but maybe not so far: we still need these spaces.\n\n“Lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer people cannot keep each other safe on our own,” Audrey White wrote in the Dallas Morning News. “We don’t have the resources, the political power, or the cultural capital necessary to eliminate the threats we face. As we make political and social gains, the people who hate us are fighting harder than ever to block our access to equal rights under the law.”\n\nAs a 33-year-old professor at Stonewall on Sunday night, Joseph Pierce, told the Times: “This just shows that being queer and proud is a radical act and one that can still put your life at risk.”\n\nSelect communities in far-flung cities know that I’m queer. Certain friends and certain family members and certain co-workers. I’m writing this anonymously because there are many people who don’t.\n\nBut every denizen of every gay club I’ve ever entered has had my trust. Because I felt protected and safe in some of the kind and happiest places I’ve ever set foot.\n\nAll of the things I have to fear on the outside—discrimination by extended family or employers or strangers on the street—are gone once I’ve walked in those doors.\n\nThink of this from Sunday morning: a vignette from Pulse that shows the kinship of LGBT strangers-in-a-bar at its best.\n\nThe Orlando Sentinel interviewed a man who saved another’s life by improvising a sort-of tourniquet with his t-shirt and squeezing him while covered in the stranger’s blood. Josh McGill kept the other man awake until an ambulance could get there. “Words cannot and will not describe the feeling of that. Being covered in blood,” McGill said. “Trying to save a guy’s life that I don’t even know.”\n\nPlaces like Pulse are courageous just for existing in a state, like Florida (and many others), where you can be fired for your sexual identity even if you survived a mass shooting the night before. (In only 19 states and Washington, D.C., there are existing laws that prevent LGBT employees from discrimination in the workplace.)\n\nTexas’ homophobic lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, infamously tweeted “man reaps what he sows” hours after the attack. “The one who sows to please his flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction,” the passage from Galatians 6:7 continues. A spokesperson for the Republican has said the tweet was “pre-scheduled.” He eventually deleted it altogether.\n\nVigils were held all over the world on Sunday night. About 500 people went to Stonewall, the world’s most famous LGBT bar, for solidarity and community on a day filled with tragedy. More will go back on Monday evening. And for many days afterward. This is where many of us need to be right now.\n\nI know I will. These are my people, and these are my places: the two are inextricably linked. And now, more than ever we need our LGBT bars, and we need to gather in them and hold them close.

'At the time, I didn't know what he was saying. He was speaking so fast. But it was...he was speaking fluently.'\n\nThe TV producer said he had answered the phone to hear the caller ask: 'Do you know about the shooting?'\n\nAfter Gentili confirmed that he did, Mateen told him that he was the shooter and that he was carrying out the attack 'for ISIS' before lapsing into Arabic.\n\nGentili asked the caller to speak in English, and then Mateen once again pledged allegiance to the terrorist group.\n\n'I did it for ISIS,' he said. 'I did it for the Islamic State.'\n\nGentili said he then asked where the caller was, who told him it was 'none of my f***ing business.'\n\nFinally, the producer asked if there was anything else Mateen wanted to say.\n\n'He said no and hung up the phone,' Gentili said. 'I will never forget the words he said to me.'\n\nMateen, an American of Afghan descent who the FBI believes was radicalized online, burst into the Pulse nightclub armed with a .223 caliber AR-15 assault rifle and a handgun just after 2am Sunday.\n\nHis rampage came to an end three hours later, when police shot him dead.\n\nMateen, who was probed in recent years for suspected extremism, is believed to have made the phone call to News 13 while he was holed up in the nightclub's bathroom with hostages.\n\n'Kept it secret': Noor Zahi Salman (left) has reportedly admitted to the FBI that she was aware of her husband Omar Mateen's plans to commit a massacre, and even helped him buy ammunition and scout locations\n\nHOW MATEEN SIZED UP TARGETS - WITH HIS WIFE'S ASSISTANCE WALT DISNEY WORLD Omar Mateen and his wife Noor Zahi Salman allegedly visited Walt Disney World in April. It has now emerged they may have gone more than once. Officers believe Mateen was looking at one park in particular: Downtown Disney. Downtown Disney is billed as an 'eclectic mix of unique boutiques, one-of-a-kind eateries and jaw-dropping entertainment that will have you wondering where the day went.' There is no bag check or metal detector to get in. The other four parks at Disney World - Magic Kingdom, Hollywood Studios, Animal Kingdom and Epcot - all have metal detectors. Walt Disney World has yet to comment on this report. PULSE Mateen had been spotted at Pulse multiple times by patrons, and would often sit in a corner drinking alone. Ty Smith told the Orlando Sentinel that he had seen Mateen at least a dozen times at the gay club, and that on occasion he 'would get so drunk he was loud and belligerent.' He also said that he did not talk much to Mateen but that he did tell him he had a wife and a son and would at times speak about his father. He was in the area for several days before the attack according to a source who spoke with USA Today, suggesting he had carefully selected his target. And now Salman has admitted she once drove Mateen to the club to check it out.\n\nIt followed a call he had made to 911 where Mateen once again pledged his allegiance to ISIS.\n\nHe had also called a friend to say goodbye during the attack, according to law enforcement officials.\n\nThe FBI are speaking to the recipient but have not released any further details about what was said during the phone call.\n\nThe agency has since pleaded for the public's help to reconstruct Mateen's movement in the hours leading up to the attack.\n\n'We need your help in developing the most complete picture of what he did and why he did it,' FBI agent Ron Hopper said at a news conference.\n\nIt has since been revealed that Mateen visited Disney Springs, an outdoor restaurant, retail and entertainment complex at Walt Disney World, on Saturday night.\n\nMeanwhile, the FBI is still trying to establish how much Mateen's wife may have know about the attack.\n\nAn official who was briefed on the case but insisted on anonymity to discuss a continuing investigation said authorities believe 30-year-old Noor Salman, an American of Pakistani descent, knew ahead of time about Mateen's plan.\n\nInvestigators have spoken extensively with her and are working to establish whether she recently accompanied Mateen to the club, said a second official who was not authorized to discuss the case publicly.\n\nUS Attorney Lee Bentley repeatedly refused to say whether charges might be brought against the wife or anyone else.\n\nHe said authorities are talking to hundreds of people and investigating everyone associated with Mateen, including family, friends and business associates.", 'title': 'Orlando gunman checked to see if his massacre was trending on Facebook', 'url': 'http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3644106/Orlando-gunman-Omar-Mateen-posted-Facebook-attack.html', 'keywords': ['mateen', 'told', 'facebook', 'phone', 'islamic', 'massacre', 'pulse', 'checked', 'disney', 'world', 'trending', 'attack', 'mateens', 'gunman', 'orlando'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': "The Orlando gunman who killed 49 people at a gay club searched to see if his massacre was trending on Facebook during his attack.\nOmar Mateen typed 'Pulse Orlando' and 'Shooting' into the search bar of his Facebook after he opened fire on Pulse nightclub on June 12.\nThe other four parks at Disney World - Magic Kingdom, Hollywood Studios, Animal Kingdom and Epcot - all have metal detectors.\nPULSE Mateen had been spotted at Pulse multiple times by patrons, and would often sit in a corner drinking alone.\nIt has since been revealed that Mateen visited Disney Springs, an outdoor restaurant, retail and entertainment complex at Walt Disney World, on Saturday night.", 'date': 1466049133}, {'text': '(CNN) The deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11 followed a clarion call by ISIS to its supporters in the United States to launch attacks during Ramadan, the Islamic Holy Month, which started last week.\n\nIn an audio recording released on May 21, ISIS spokesman Abu Mohammed al Adnani called for "a month of hurt" in the United States as well as Europe.\n\nHis message to ISIS sympathizers like Orlando shooter Omar Mateen : Stay home and kill anybody, anyhow, anywhere.\n\n\'Terrorize them\'\n\n"The smallest action you do in the heart of their land is dearer to us than the largest action by us, and more effective and more damaging to them," al Adnani said, according to a translation by the SITE Intelligence Group.\n\n"And if one of you wishes and tries hard to reach the Islamic State, then one of us wishes to be in your place to hurt the Crusaders day and night without sleeping, and terrorize them so that the neighbor fears his neighbor."\n\nIt was the latest in a series of calls for attacks by Adnani, whose fatwas describing hitting the West as religious duty have motivated multiple plotters on both sides of the Atlantic to launch attacks.\n\nIt was also the most strident call for attacks yet and a sign ISIS is mobilizing its supporters and fighters to wage an all-out campaign of revenge as it loses territory in Syria, Iraq and Libya.\n\nWestern intelligence officials believe Adnani oversees ISIS\' external attack plotting and had command responsibility for the Paris and Brussels attacks.\n\nPhotos: Orlando nightclub shooting Police investigate the back of the Pulse nightclub in Orlando on Sunday, June 12.

Hide Caption 20 of 20\n\nLoss of appeal?\n\nThe Orlando attack comes at a time when there are some signs ISIS is losing its appeal in the United States.\n\nLast month, FBI Director James Comey said there had been a sharp drop in the number of Americans attempting to travel to Syria and Iraq to join ISIS.\n\nIn the first half of 2015, the FBI was seeing six to 10 American residents trying to travel each month, a figure that dropped to just one per month since August 2015. But one concern officials have had is that American ISIS sympathizers unable to reach the so-called caliphate would attempt to launch attacks in the United States instead.\n\nIn previous messages, ISIS has told its supporters they will be rewarded tenfold in paradise for carrying out attacks during Ramadan, an example of them inventing theological precepts to suit their purposes.\n\nThe group has also made clear its visceral and vicious homophobia by throwing people they suspect of being gay off buildings in their so-called caliphate and stoning them.\n\nNo direct ties\n\nOrlando gunman Mateen swore allegiance to ISIS in a 911 call as his attack got underway, providing ISIS with an opportunity to claim ownership of the attack. Hours after the massacre, the ISIS-affiliated Amaq news agency claimed the attack had been carried out by an ISIS fighter, without offering any proof of advance knowledge.\n\nAs of Sunday night no evidence had emerged of direct organizational ties between Mateen and ISIS.\n\nThe emergence of ISIS has seen its message resonate in the United States over the past two years, partly because it has so skillfully exploited social media to spread its propaganda and create a virtual community of like-minded followers who constantly interact and reinforce each other.\n\nAccording to a database maintained by the majority staff of the House Homeland Security Committee, U.S. law enforcement agencies have 1,000 active investigations into U.S. homegrown jihadis, 80% of which involved ISIS sympathizers.\n\nSince 2014 there have been 87 sympathizers charged with terror-related offences in the United State and there have been 25 terrorist plots inspired by or instigated by ISIS. Many of those were thwarted in FBI sting operations.\n\nUnder the radar\n\nJUST WATCHED Ex-wife of Orlando shooter speaks out Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Ex-wife of Orlando shooter speaks out 01:09\n\nThe high number of cases is likely one of the reasons Mateen was not under surveillance at the time of the attacks.\n\nWith investigations in 50 states, U.S. law enforcement agencies have had to prioritize. Mateen first came across the FBI radar screen in 2013 after co-workers flagged signs of radicalization.\n\nIn 2014, the FBI interviewed Mateen again over possible connections with a fellow Floridian, Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha , who joined al Qaeda in Syria and blew himself up in a suicide truck bombing in May that year.\n\nIn a video recorded before his death, Salha stated he had attempted to recruit Florida friends to travel with him to Syria. The FBI found no grounds for continuing its investigation of Mateen.\n\n"We determined that contact was minimal and did not constitute a substantive relationship or threat at that time," said FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Ronald Hopper.\n\nFew but deadly\n\nAmerican Muslim leaders were swift to condemn the Orlando shootings. The overwhelming majority of American Muslims reject ISIS\' ideology, with radicalization rates being far lower in the United States than in European countries like France or the United Kingdom.\n\nBut a key and growing concern of U.S. counterterrorism officials is that ISIS operatives in Syria and Iraq are communicating directly with American sympathizers by using online encryption messaging apps, grooming them for attacks.\n\nOn the morning of an attack at a "Draw the Prophet Mohammed Contest" in Garland, Texas, in May 2015, British ISIS operative Junaid Hussain exchanged 109 messages with one of the gunmen.\n\n"In the course of the period from April 1 to July 4 in New York City, and from Boston to Morgantown, North Carolina, we had a dozen arrests in three or four plots, two of which targeted New York City directly, and this was all based on ISIS meeting people on Twitter and talking to them on encrypted apps," NYPD counterterrorism Commissioner John Miller told CTC Sentinel earlier this year.\n\n"What we were seeing was a pace of cases and arrests and plotters that we hadn\'t seen before. We were seeing that the mass marketing of terrorism was starting to be more effective than we had ever seen with any other kind of messaging before."\n\nAnother longstanding concern of U.S. counterterrorism officials is the relatively easy access to powerful weapons in the United States.\n\nThere have been a string of deadly Islamist terrorist attacks involving firearms in the United States, including the killing of five members of the U.S. military in July 2015 in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and 14 people at a holiday party last December in San Bernardino, California , an attack also inspired by ISIS.\n\nIn 2011 al Qaeda instructed its followers to take advantage of what by international standards are weak gun laws.\n\nWhile terrorist groups don\'t have nearly as many supporters in the United States, it\'s much easier for followers of such groups to get guns.', 'title': 'Orlando shooting follows ISIS call for Ramadan attacks', 'url': 'https://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/13/us/orlando-shooting-isis-ramadan-attacks/index.html', 'keywords': ['shooting', 'states', 'photos', 'follows', 'united', 'attacks', 'nightclub', '20', 'isis', 'caption', 'ramadan', 'orlando', 'hide'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Photos: Orlando nightclub shooting Police investigate the back of the Pulse nightclub in Orlando on Sunday, June 12.\nHide Caption 4 of 20 Photos: Orlando nightclub shooting Jeremy Glatstein donates blood in Orlando on June 12.\nHide Caption 11 of 20 Photos: Orlando nightclub shooting A police officer stands guard outside the Orlando Regional Medical Center.\nHide Caption 15 of 20 Photos: Orlando nightclub shooting Police in Orlando direct family members away from the scene of the shooting.\nHide Caption 16 of 20 Photos: Orlando nightclub shooting Shooting victims are attended to by emergency responders outside the club.', 'date': 1465776000}, {'text': 'A series of photos shows the devastating scene left after Omar Mateen opened fire inside an Orlando gay night club killing 49 innocent people and injuring dozens more.\n\nMateen, who became the worst mass shooter in American history, shot more than 100 people with an AR-15 assault rifle and handgun on the dance floor at Pulse night club early Sunday morning.\n\nInvestigators are examining evidence at Pulse nightclub in an attempt to uncover exactly what happened at the nightclub.\n\nSunday night, workers were removing bodies four at a time on stretchers out of the club and loaded them into white vans.

Gunman Mateen was killed when he crawled through the wall firing his weapons at waiting officers. John Mina, chief of police at the City of Orlando Police Department, told how his officers handled the tense standoff with the terrorist who carried out the worst mass shooting in US history. Mateen shot some of his initial victims at the Orlando club before taking the rest hostage. He barricaded himself in a toilet with around four or five hostages and called 911. FBI Director James Comey added in a statement on Monday that the shooter was involved in precisely three calls to a 911 dispatcher at approximately 2:30am. Comey said: \'He (Mateen) called and hung up. He called again and spoke with the dispatcher and hung up. \'And the dispatcher called him back and they spoke briefly. \'During the calls he said he was doing this for the leader of ISIS, who he named, and pledged loyalty to. But he also appeared to claim solidarity with the perpetrators of the Boston Marathon bombings and solidarity with the Florida man who died as a suicideb bomber in Syria for Al-Nusra Front - a group in conflict with the so-called Islamic State. \'The Boston bombers and the suicide bomber from Florida were not inspired by ISIS, which adds a little bit to the confusion about his motives\', Comey concluded. Police chiefs chose to act when he boasted to the 911 call handler about ‘bomb vests, explosives’ and said he would murder more young people. Officers first laid explosives on the wall to create a space which those held hostage could escape through. Officers then drove the vehicle at speed crashing into the wall when the first plan failed. Mateen then wriggled out of the hole and fired before he was shot down. Police said the action saved the lives of dozens of people.\n\nThirty-nine of the dead were killed at the club, and 11 people died at hospitals, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said.\n\nJon Alamo had been dancing at the Pulse for hours when he wandered into the club\'s main room just in time to see the gunman. "You ever seen how Marine guys hold big weapons, shooting from left to right? That\'s how he was shooting at people," he said.\n\n\'My first thought was, oh my God, I\'m going to die," Alamo said. "I was praying to God that I would live to see another day.\'\n\nMateen, who purchased the weapons legally, had been investigated by the FBI three times but the bureau did not take further action.\n\nConcerns about homophobic remarks he made whilst at work did not stop him from being employed as a security guard at G4S for nine years.\n\nThe company offers security advice and personnel to countries around the world and also secures some US nuclear sites.\n\nThe gunman exchanged fire with an officer working around the club at 2am before going back inside, according to Orlando Police Chief John Minia.\n\nWriting on Facebook, Pulse, which described itself as the most prominent gay club in Orlando, urged party-goers to \'get out and keep running\' as bullets started to fly.\n\nThere were about 320 people inside the club at the time of the shootings and about 100 people were taken hostage.\n\n\'He had an automatic rifle, so nobody stood a chance,\' said Jackie Smith, who saw two friends next to her get shot. \'I just tried to get out of there.\'\n\nAt 2:09 a.m., Pulse posted on its Facebook page: "Everyone get out of Pulse and keep running."\n\nMateen went on to exchange gunfire with 14 police officers at the club, and took hostages at one point. In addition to the assault rifle, the shooter also had a handgun and some sort of \'suspicious device,\' Police Chief John Mina.\n\nAbout 5 a.m., authorities sent in a SWAT team to rescue the remaining club-goers, Mina said.\n\nAt first, officers mistakenly thought the gunman had strapped explosives to the dead after a bomb robot sent back images of a battery part next to a body, Mayor Dyer said. The robot was sent in after SWAT team members put explosive charges on a wall and an armored vehicle knocked it down in an effort to rescue hostages.\n\nNine hero officers used a \'controlled explosion\' to distract the shooter before fatally shooting him and were able to rescue about 30 hostages who were hiding in the bathroom of the club.\n\nDuring the gunfire, an officer was shot, but he was saved by his helmet. It was thought that at least one hostage had been locked in a bathroom with gunshot wounds.\n\nMayor Buddy Dyer said in a press conference: \'Many were saved by the heroic efforts of the men and women of the OPD, the Orange County Sheriffs, Seminal County Sheriff\'s office.\'\n\nAt around 6am local time police tweeted: \'Pulse Shooting: The shooter inside the club is dead.\'\n\nLocal and federal authorities are tasked with what is expected to be a lengthy investigation into the shooting.\n\nPhotos taken both on the ground and overhead show forensic investigators at the scene working to piece together exactly what happened, as huge holes can been seen left in the walls.\n\nAuthorities said on Sunday that Mateen, who was from Port St Lucie in Florida, was quizzed three times by the FBI for terror links and concerns.\n\nThe shooter, who had no criminal history, was licensed to work as an armed security guard in Florida, law enforcement sources said.\n\nAn FBI spokesman said at a press conference later in the day that Mateen purchased multiple guns in the past few days.\n\nThe spokesman said that the investigations by the FBI were closed and that\'s why the 29-year-old gunman was able to purchase the weapons.\n\nThe federal agency said Mateen was first interviewed in 2013 after he made \'inflammatory remarks\' to a colleague.\n\n\'The FBI first became aware of Mateen in 2013 as he made inflammatory comments to coworkers, alleging possible terrorist ties,\' Ron Hopper an FBI special agent said during a press conference.\n\nThe 2013 investigation came after he told his co-workers he knew the Tsaranev brothers who were responsible for the Boston bombing.\n\nMATEEN WAS \'DISTRESSED\' WHEN HE BOUGHT ST LUCIE PROPERTY IN 2013 Further details about Mateen\'s property arrangements have come to light. Police officers have removed evidence from 519 and 937 south-west Bayshore Boulevard, St Lucie. The four and three-bed homes are a four minute drive between each other. Mateen was said to be in a \'distressed\' state when he bought number 937 for $95,000 in September 2013. Today it is thought to be worth about $190,000. The Palm Beach Post reported that he took out a $76,000 loan to finance the home. It was advertised as a \'spacious pool home\' which needs \'a little TLC\'. The second home at 519 was bought for $160,000 in 2010, having been built two years earlier. His father Mir Seddique, also known as Seddique Mateen, has his company The Durand Jirga, registered at 519. It has 10 rooms and is built over two stories and is worth about $250,000.\n\nFederal and local law enforcement remove evidence from two Treasure Coast homes that are linked to Orlando nightclub shooter, 29-year-old Omar Mateen\n\nMateen\'s name was registered at two homes in Orlando which police raided on Sunday for evidence as their investigation continues\n\nEdward Sotomayor Jr. (left) and Stanley Almodovar III (right) were the first victims identified in the aftermath of the worst mass shooting in American history\n\nPolice forensic investigators work at the crime scene of a mass shooting at the Pulse gay night club in Orlando\n\nPolice forensic investigators examine large holes on the side of the building which holds Pulse nightclub\n\nPolice forensic investigators work at the crime scene on Sunday after 49 people were killed at the Orlando club\n\nCOLLEAGUES COMPLAINED ABOUT MATEEN\'S \'FREQUENT\' RACIST AND HOMOPHOBIC COMMENTS AND SAID HE WAS \'UNHINGED\' Mateen led what many would consider a normal life: he was married, had a child and worked as a security guard. But he was really an \'unhinged\' extremist who regularly made homophobic and racist remarks at work. That\'s the account of former police officer Daniel Gilroy who worked alongside Mateen, 29, for security firm G4S. Gilroy said he complained to bosses but they did nothing because of Mateen\'s Muslim faith. \'I quit because everything he said was toxic,\' Gilroy told Florida Today. \'...and the company wouldn\'t do anything. This guy was unhinged and unstable. He talked of killing people.\' Gilroy said Mateen would take over from him on shift at PGA Village between 2014-15. Mateen began stalking him, sent up to 30 messages and made around 15 calls to him a day, Gilroy added.\n\nInvestigators are facing a difficult task, as 49 people were killed inside the club during the shooting\n\nThe inside of Pulse night club appears to be heavily damaged as glass from broken windows is likely inside\n\nFBI agents investigate the severely damaged rear wall of the Pulse Nightclub after the shooting on Sunday\n\nFBI agents investigate the damaged rear wall of the Pulse Nightclub in what is the deadliest mass shooting in American history\n\nAR-15 RIFLE MATEEN CARRIED HAS OFTEN BEEN USED IN MASS SHOOTINGS IN US HISTORY The AR-15 rifle is the civilian model of the M-16 and is capable of firing a large number of rounds in seconds The type of AR-15 rifle that terrorist Omar Mateen used to kill 49 people and wound dozens more at the nightclub in Orlando has become the weapon of choice for mass murderers in the U.S. and is one of the common links between the shootings. Even though it has caused carnage and left dozens of people dead in multiple shootings this decade alone, the military-inspired semi-automatic rifle designed for civilian use is perfectly legal in most states. There were calls for a nationwide ban after the same type of firearm - capable of firing dozens of rounds in less than a minute without being reloaded - was used in the Sandy Hook school shooting, but it remains readily available at gun shops and was purchased just last week by Mateen before he went on his killing spree. The AR-15 rifle is the civilian model of the M-16 and is capable of firing a large number of rounds in seconds Mateen, 29, was armed with a .223-caliber AR-15-type rifle and a 9mm semi-automatic pistol – both legally purchased – when he opened fire at the Pulse gay club in Orlando early Sunday morning. Called a ‘killing machine’ or \'weapon of war\' by those who want to see it banned, the AR-15 rifle is the civilian version of the fully-automatic M16 used by soldiers in the Vietnam War. Unlike the M16, users must pull the trigger every time they want to fire a shot. The most common versions of the AR-15 have been banned in a handful of states, including California. When it is used against humans it is intended to cause maximum carnage in a brief amount of time, said experts.\n\n\'The FBI thoroughly investigated the matter including interviews of witnesses, physical surveillance and records checks.\n\n\'In the course of that investigation, Mateen was interviewed twice.\'Ultimately we were unable to verify the substance of his comments, and the investigation was closed.\'\n\nIn 2014, Mateen came to the FBI\'s attention again and agents interviewed him about a potential connection he may have had with American suicide bomber Moner Abu Salha, who lived about 30 minutes away in Vero Beach, Florida.\n\n\'We determined that contact was minimal and didn\'t to constitute a substantive relationship or threat at that that time,\' Hopper said.\n\nIn addition, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said that Mateen purchased two weapons legally within the last week.\n\n\'He is not a prohibitive person so he can legally walk into a gun dealership,\' the representative from the ATF said. \'He did so within the last week or so.\'\n\nFBI agents investigate near the damaged rear wall of the nightclub on Sunday afternoon\n\nLarge holes were left in the brick wall at the rear of the nightclub after the horrific shooting\n\n\'He\'s a known quantity,\' another source said. \'He\'s been on the radar before.\'\n\nGlobal security firm, G4S, confirmed that he worked for the company since 2007.\n\n\'We are shocked and saddened by the tragic event that occurred at the Orlando nightclub,\' a statement by the company reads.\n\n\'We can confirm that Omar Mateen had been employed with G4S since September 10, 2007. We are cooperating fully with all law enforcement authorities, including the FBI, as they conduct their investigation.\n\n\'Our thoughts and prayers are with all of the friends, families and people affected by this unspeakable tragedy.\'\n\nAn FBI spokesman said Sunday\'s mass shooting is being investigated as an act of terrorism, adding that they are looking into whether it was an act of domestic or international terror, and if the Mateen was a lone wolf.\n\nThe FBI believe Mateen, who was shot dead by officers, may have \'leanings to radical Islamic terrorism\'.\n\nA group of authorities stand near the rear of the nightclub as they conduct an investigation into the shooting\n\nBut his father, Mir Seddique, told NBC News his son became angry when he saw two men kissing in Miami several months ago.\n\n\'This has nothing to do with religion,\' he said. \'We are saying we are apologizing for the whole incident. We weren\'t aware of any action he is taking. We are in shock like the whole country.\'\n\nTwitter accounts which claim to be affiliated to the Islamic State have hailed the shooting, although DailyMail.com cannot confirm whether the terror group was behind the attack.\n\nMateen, a Muslim and father to a three-year-old son, was born in 1986 in New York and married Sitora Alisherzoda Yusufiy, who was born in Uzbekistan, in 2009.\n\nHis father told NBC News: \'We were in Downtown Miami, Bayside, people were playing music. And he saw two men kissing each other in front of his wife and kid and he got very angry.\'\n\n\'They were kissing each other and touching each other and he said, \'Look at that. In front of my son they are doing that\'.

In chorus with Obama he emphasized that there continued to be no evidence, however, of any direct plot, or direction of the shooter, by any foreign group or network.\n\n“There is no clear evidence that he was directed externally,” Obama said.\n\nThe mounting evidence of the killer’s online radicalization, together with the absence of links to organized terrorism and his potent hatred towards the gay community provide a toxic soup that is already permeating the debate around this year’s presidential election.\n\nThe potent emotions generated by such a bloody outrage, combined with Florida’s lax gun laws and the shooter’s embrace of Isis in calls made during the rampage, have the potential to send the race for the White House in unpredictable directions.\n\nObama sought to keep a level head in the fallout from the attack by refusing to identify the massacre as either merely a terrorism issue or a question of gun control. It was both, he said.\n\nThe president warned against “getting into an either or debate”, saying that both access to weapons and terrorism were factors that equally needed to be addressed.\n\n“If we have self-radicalized individuals in this country, then they are going to be very difficult to find ahead of time, and, how easy it is for them to find weapons is, in some cases, going to make a difference as to whether they are going to be able to carry out attacks like this,” he said.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Hillary Clinton made a pointed intervention in the post-Orlando discussions by calling for the reinstatement of the assault weapons ban that had been a cornerstone of her husband Bill Clinton’s administration in the 1990s. The legislation that banned AR-15-style assault weapons of the sort used in many of the most bloody and notorious recent mass shootings – including the 2012 Sandy Hook killing of 20 children and their teachers in Connecticut – was allowed to lapse after 10 years in 2004.\n\nA similar firearm was deployed by Mateen at Pulse, along with a semi-automatic Glock handgun.\n\nClinton said that Mateen had used a “weapon of war” – legally purchased in Florida some time last week despite the fact that the shooter had been on the FBI’s anti-terrorist radar – “to shoot down at least 50 innocent Americans”. She criticised the gun lobby and said: “I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety reform across our country would make a difference.”\n\nAs if to underline the vast gulf that now lies between the two main candidates to replace Obama in the White House next January, the presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump unleashed his opposite, and highly polarizing, take on the Pulse tragedy. Following his tweet on Sunday in which he had congratulated himself hours after the disaster for having proposed a ban on all Muslims entering the US, he berated the Muslim community in this country for failing to report potential terrorists such as Mateen, who he called a “whack job”.\n\n“They knew that this guy had a potential for blow-up. They don’t report them. For some reason the Muslim community don’t report people like this,” Trump told CNN.\n\nDonald Trump used a speech yesterday in New Hampshire to make the election a referendum on “radical Islam”. The presumptive nominee said “this is not just a national security issue, it’s a quality of life issue” and argued: “We need to tell the truth about how radical Islam is coming to our shores, and it’s coming with these people, folks, it’s coming.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jonathan Dalton, who lost friends in the attack, visits a makeshift memorial in Orlando, Florida, on Monday. Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOne account of events inside the club suggested the gunman had laughed as he killed a bathroom stall full of victims.\n\n\n\nDeyni Ventura, a pastor in nearby Sanford and a friend of the mother of a clubgoer described what she had been told. “He was laughing frantically, ‘ha ha ha ha ha’, as he was spraying people with his gun,” she said.\n\nVentura, said her friend Vanessa’s son Norman, who she would identify only by their first names, had received four gunshot wounds to his back but was expected to be released from hospital by Tuesday.\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside the family assistance center close to Pulse nightclub, she said: “He was in a bathroom stall with 30 other people, and those 30 other people are deceased. He is the only one that lived,” she added.\n\n“When he laughed he took his gun and sprayed under the bathroom stall and on top of the bathroom stall, so then the bodies started collapsing and blood was going everywhere in the handicapped stall, 30 people squished in there getting shot. He was laughing like he was making fun of the victims.”\n\nIn his briefing in Washington, Comey, the FBI director, gave further details of the shooter’s declaration of allegiance to Isis that he made over the course of his three-hour rampage at the club. At about 2.30am on Sunday morning – half an hour into the attack – Mateen spoke three times to a 911 dispatcher, declaring that he was acting on behalf of the leader of Isis.\n\nHole in wall helped free dozens held hostage during Pulse nightclub shooting Read more\n\nThe gunman also declared his solidarity with the Tsarnaev brothers, who carried out the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, as well as to Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha, a Palestinian American who worshipped in the same mosque as Mateen in Fort Pierre, Florida, and who carried out a suicide attack in Syria in May 2014.\n\n\n\nComey said these various allegiances were puzzling as the Tsarnaevs were not linked to Isis and Abu-Salha was working for the al-Nusra front which was actively in conflict with the terrorist group. “That adds a bit to the confusion around his motives,” the FBI director said.\n\nThe FBI itself is facing heat over the fact that it had Mateen in its sights, interviewing him three times in 2013 and 2014 for suspected extremism and connections with Abu-Salha. On both occasions, the information gleaned was considered too thin to merit further action.\n\nComey said agents had used informants, and recorded conversations and surveillance, as well as an extensive search of government databases. But Mateen had convinced them that his outspoken comments in 2013 were made because he was angry towards co-workers who had teased him for being Muslim.\n\nThe FBI chief said the bureau was looking into whether it had made any mistakes, but added: “So far I don’t think so. We are looking for needles in a nationwide haystack, and that’s hard.”\n\nAs the political storm raged across the country, in Orlando the sombre job of informing families of those who had died continued. In latest figures, authorities confirmed that 49 people had died, of whom all but one had been identified, plus the shooter.\n\nA further 53 people were injured, six of whom have been discharged from hospital. Among those remaining in hospital, five were said to be in “grave condition”.\n\nOf the dead, the families of 36 had been notified and their names listed on an official website. They ranged form the youngest, Luis Omar Ocasio-Capo, aged 20, to the oldest, 40-year-old Javier Jorge-Reyes.\n\nFour of the 36 were women. The victims came from diverse employment backgrounds, including a travel agent, technician and brand manager, but they shared a common embrace of the LGBT culture and a love of dancing that brought them to Latin dance night at Pulse.\n\nReflecting that Hispanic accent of the night, most of the deceased were Latino, many from Orlando’s large and growing Puerto Rican population. Last names such as Sotomayor, Almodovar, Ortiz-Rivera and Perez abound.\n\nObama said that amid the febrile focus on the shooter’s terrorist radicalization, the fact should not be forgotten that he had targeted a gay nightclub. Groups such as Isis and al-Qaida used their “perverted Islam” to “target gays and lesbians because they believe that they do not abide by their attitudes towards sexuality”.\n\nObama added that there are “clearly connections between and attitudes of organizations like this and attitudes toward tolerance and whether all people are to be treated equally regardless of their sexual orientation”.', 'title': 'FBI and Obama confirm Omar Mateen was radicalized on the internet', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/13/pulse-nightclub-attack-shooter-radicalized-internet-orlando', 'keywords': ['mateen', 'radicalized', 'pulse', 'gun', 'stall', 'fbi', 'used', 'nightclub', 'internet', 'omar', 'confirm', 'obama', 'attack', 'ha'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Trump insinuates Obama is harboring secret agenda linked to Orlando attack Read moreComey added that he was “highly confident” that Mateen had been radicalized at least in part online.\nA similar firearm was deployed by Mateen at Pulse, along with a semi-automatic Glock handgun.\n“He was laughing frantically, ‘ha ha ha ha ha’, as he was spraying people with his gun,” she said.\nAt about 2.30am on Sunday morning – half an hour into the attack – Mateen spoke three times to a 911 dispatcher, declaring that he was acting on behalf of the leader of Isis.\nObama said that amid the febrile focus on the shooter’s terrorist radicalization, the fact should not be forgotten that he had targeted a gay nightclub.', 'date': 1465776000}, {'text': 'NEW YORK (CBSNewYork/CBS News/AP) — Orlando massacre Gunman Omar Mir Seddique Mateen armed himself with both an assault rifle and a handgun when he opened fire on a gay nightclub and left 50 people dead.\n\nOfficials said Mateen, 20, was born in New York.

During the 911 call, Mateen referenced Boston marathon bombers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, Pegues reports.\n\nMateen gave his full name to 911 dispatchers, according to Pegues.\n\nISIS officially took credit for the attack on social media, but American investigators have yet to corroborate the claim. ISIS has in the past taken credit for attacks that were not planned by them.\n\nA U.S. intelligence source told CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton that Islamic terrorism is being investigated as a possible motive in the shooting because of several indicators, including the style of the attack, which had similarities to the attacks in Paris in November 2015 and Brussels in March.\n\nHe Was Known To The FBI\n\nMateen had been on federal law enforcement radar in recent years. According to FBI Agent Ron Hopper, Mateen first came to the FBI’s attention in 2013 when he made inflammatory comments to co-workers alleging possible ties to terrorism. Hopper says the claims were “thoroughly investigated” and Mateen was interviewed twice.\n\n“In the course of the investigation, Mateen was interviewed twice,” Hopper said. ‘Ultimately, we were unable to verify the substance of his comments and the investigation was closed.”\n\nMateen again surfaced on federal radar in 2014, Hopper said, as someone who may have had ties to a suicide bomber. Mateen was again interviewed, but investigators determined the contact was minimal and didn’t constitute a threat. That investigation was also closed out, Hopper said.\n\nMoner Abu-Salha blew himself up in 2014.\n\n“We determined that contact was minimal and did not constitute a substantive relationship or a threat at that time,” Hopper said.\n\nHe Legally Purchased Two Weapons\n\nAn ATF official said Mateen had legally purchased a handgun and a “long gun” within the past week. Mateen had a concealed carry permit from the state of Florida allowing him to legally purchase a firearm in the state, a law enforcement source told Milton.\n\n“We know that this individual did purchase at least two firearms,” said Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Assistant Special-Agent-in-Charge Trevor Velinor. “He is not a prohibited person. so he can legally walk into a gun dealership and acquire and purchase firearms.”\n\nOrlando Police Chief John Mina said the suspect was armed with a handgun and an AR-15-style assault rifle. There’s no current indication that Mateen had accomplices, police say.\n\nHe Worked As A Security Guard And Worshiped At An Islamic Center\n\nMateen worked as a security guard, and was employed by G4S Security since Sept. 10, 2007. In a statement, G4S said they are “shocked and saddened by the tragic event” and are cooperating with law enforcement.\n\nCBS News confirmed that Mateen worshiped at the Islamic Center in Fort Pierce, about 15 miles north of Port St. Lucie and 120 miles south of Orlando. Men at the mosque who didn’t want to be identified told CBS News they have known Mateen for about five years and that he would come to the center with his son, a 3-year-old, to pray. They described Mateen as a devoted father and family man and said there was no indication that he would do something like this.\n\nAn imam there told CBS News he was married.\n\nThe Islamic Center released a statement condemning the attack, calling it “monstrous.”\n\n“The Muslim community of Fort Pierce joins our fellow Americans in repudiating anyone or any group that would claim to justify or excuse such an appalling act of violence,” the statement read.\n\nThe imam at the Islamic Center described his family as very caring. He said the mosque preaches moderate Islam, and he was completely surprised by the terrible act of violence.\n\n“This is the act of the individual,” said Imam Syed Shafeeq Rahman of the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce. “What is cooking in his mind we do not know only god knows what was in his mind.”\n\nA law enforcement official has confirmed to CBS news senior investigative producer Pat Milton that Mateen made the Hajj, an Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia in March 2012.\n\nHe Allegedly Abused His Former Wife\n\nThe suspect had been married to Sitora Yusufiy for several months before divorcing in 2011, Milton reports.\n\nAn Edison, New Jersey man who identified himself as Yusufiy’s father and Mateen’s former father-in-law told CBS News his daughter was married to Mateen seven years ago. He said the two met online and had only known each other for a few months when she moved to Florida and married him.\n\n“When we even heard that, we actually didn’t like that,” said the man, who didn’t give his name. “Because we are people who believe in conservative traditions, and we said you know it’s weird that you know this person for two to three months online.”\n\nThe man said Mateen became abusive towards his daughter. The family went to Florida in September 2009 to pick up their daughter and called police to get her belongings, he said. She later filed for divorce.\n\nSince then, the woman and her family have had no contact with Mateen, he said.\n\nYusufiy herself also described her ex-husband’s behavior.\n\n“He was mentally unstable and mentally ill. That’s the only explanation that I can give. And he was obviously disturbed,” she said.\n\nThe family is from Uzbekistan and came to the U.S. in 1999, the man said. He said he was surprised to learn Mateen was the suspected gunman.\n\n“I was really shocked, why would he do such a thing? So many people,” the man said.\n\nOfficials Piecing Together A Profile\n\nOfficials are trying to piece together who the suspect was and hone in on his online footprint. A law enforcement source tells Milton investigators are seeking court authorized search warrants for the suspect’s home, car, and communication devices including his cell phone and computer. Police have said the suspect was driving a van that was found outside the nightclub.\n\nThey are also seeking Mateen’s financial records and phone records to determine who he may have been in contact with, including anyone overseas.\n\nAuthorities are investigating whether Mateen was on a terrorism watchlist, which could shed light on a possible motive, Pegues reports. Mateen has no apparent criminal history, according to sources. Allegations of anti-gay leanings amid investigation into possible hate motivation.\n\nThe suspect’s father, Mir Seddique, has spoken out to the media, saying his son was anti-gay and he doesn’t believe the attack was motivated by religion.\n\nMir Seddique said his son got angry when he saw two men kissing in Miami a couple of months ago and thinks that may be related to the shooting, WFOR-TV, CBS4 in Miami reported.\n\nSeddique says: “We are saying we are apologizing for the whole incident. … We are in shock like the whole country.”\n\nFlorida Rep. Alan Grayson said he believes the attack was “ideologically motivated.”\n\nSources tell Milton that authorities investigating the incident are still looking into whether the attack is a hate crime. But Grayson said he believes “it’s no coincidence that the attack took place where it did and when it did.”\n\n“It might be that we’ve seen the commission of an awful hate crime last night,” Grayson said.\n\n(TM and © Copyright 2016 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

The Guardian has not been able to independently confirm the report by NBC.\n\nAmid the intense scrutiny of Mateen’s motivations and life, his second wife has lain low, avoiding the media and cameras in the aftermath of the shooting.\n\n\n\nFew records describe how she lived, whether she worked, or when she married the man who fathered her child and died in the attack on Sunday. But conversations with neighbors in Florida and California, where she grew up, paint a picture of a quiet woman who rarely appeared in public.\n\n\n\nSalman, who is of Palestinian descent, grew up in Rodeo, California, a small town of 8,600 in the San Francisco Bay Area, and graduated from John Swett high school in nearby Crockett in 2004.\n\nThe neighborhood is a typical suburban subdivision with some well-tended front yard and others filled with weeds. Roses and brown lawn are in front of the two-storey, light-green house where Noor Salman once lived. Her mother still lives in the home, but her father has died.\n\n“She’s beautiful; she’s tall,” said Rajinder Chahal, an Indian-born mortgage broker who lives across the street. He said Salman was a “normal child”.\n\n“She was born here. She was not extremist,” he said.\n\nChahal added that Noor’s mother has lived in the house since about 1990. “She was very strict with her daughters,” he said. “She never allowed them to mix with other cultures.”\n\nWeeks after Noor’s 19th birthday, in June 2005, she married her first husband, Ahmed Abu-Rahma. On graduates.com, a website for reconnecting high school classmates, Salman wrote that, eight months after marrying him, she was living in Chicago and working at a daycare. Beyond that, she wrote, “nothing else has changed”.\n\n\n\nBy the summer of 2009, the couple’s relationship had deteriorated, and in December, Salman served Abu-Rahma divorce papers and moved back to California.\n\n\n\nRecords from the pair’s divorce file shed some light on Salman’s early years out of high school: she owned a coin collection and jewelry that in total was worth $7,000. She also had $3,000 of debt, while Abu-Rahma listed no property.\n\nAn email for Salman listed on a public records database is registered to the now-defunct Heald College in Concord, California, but it is unclear if she attended the school or worked there.\n\nNeighbors told a local NBC affiliate that she married Mateen and moved to Florida five years ago. In 2011 and 2012, federal law enforcement officials have said Mateen made two trips to Saudi Arabia. The couple has a child aged three.\n\nNeighbors also said Salman only returned home to visit family in California twice, once in 2011 for her sister’s wedding, with Omar Mateen at her side, and again roughly two years ago for her father’s funeral, and suggested that he was very controlling of her. Mateen’s first wife, Sitora Yusufiy, has said that he beat her and held her hostage.\n\n“I don’t know why he didn’t allow her to come here,” Chahal said of Mateen.\n\nSalman and Mateen lived in an apartment in Fort Pierce, Florida, among a gray, low-slung group of buildings set back on a residential street. This week, a Fort Pierce police cruiser idled outside.\n\n\n\nThere, some of the couple’s longtime neighbors said they were unaware that Mateen ever had a wife.\n\n“We used to see him and his son in the neighborhood,” said Rebecca McKinney, a 32-year-old neighbor, who has lived there 17 years. “We never knew he even had a wife,” said McKinney.\n\nOmar Mateen: Orlando killer's ex-wife says he beat her and held her hostage Read more\n\nHer father echoed McKinney’s bewilderment.\n\n“Never, never have I seen her. I can only remember seeing the dude once or twice,” said Mike Warner, a 21-year resident of the neighborhood who lives near the complex.\n\nEstella Flores, a 12-year local who lived directly adjacent to the complex, said she occasionally saw Mateen jogging early in the morning. He was a “normal person, but serious”, she said. However, she had never seen Salman or their child.\n\n\n\nOther neighbors simply said they had “no clue” Mateen lived there, or simply called it “scary”.\n\nWhether Mateen was financially reliant on his father is unclear. Records filed in 2011 for the divorce from his first wife show he earned $400 per week working for G4S, the private security firm.\n\nIn a 2013 filing, the couple’s names were on a mortgage document for a residence on Bayshore Boulevard in Port St Lucie. Mateen’s father, Seddique, co-signed for the Port St Lucie home, and is described as the “mortgagor” on the property, but he lives in a single-family home, less than a mile away.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that, at some point, Salman left Mateen and returned to her family’s home in Rodeo.

Legislation sponsored by Senator Dianne Feinstein of California would allow the attorney general to block sales of firearms or explosives to people as long as there is “a reasonable belief that such individual may use a firearm or explosive in connection with terrorism.”\n\nThe bill failed on a party-line vote in December. Democrats said they would try to attach the measure as an amendment to an appropriations bill on the Senate floor later this month, hoping the Orlando attack will jostle a few more Republicans running for reelection this fall. Hillary Clinton reiterated her support for the effort during a speech in Cleveland on Monday. “If the FBI is watching you for suspected terrorist links, you shouldn’t be able to just go buy a gun with no questions asked,” she said. “You shouldn’t be able to exploit loopholes and evade criminal background checks by buying online or at a gun show. And yes, if you’re too dangerous to get on a plane, you are too dangerous to buy a gun in America.”\n\nClinton also pushed to reinstate the ban on assault weapons—a move that might have more direct relevance to the Orlando shooting. But despite their agreement on the policy, Senate Democrats downplayed the effort as a matter of legislative strategy. “It is my move that in terms of terrorism, this is the most effective legislation that could pass,” Senator Charles Schumer of New York told reporters of the watch-list bill.\n\nRepublicans and the National Rifle Association have argued that the measure short-circuits due process and gives added legal weight to a flawed, sprawling list that once flagged Ted Kennedy as a threat. As David Graham wrote last year, the politics of the watch list have pretty much flipped in the decade-and-a-half since 9/11. Democrats said Feinstein’s bill is virtually identical to one proposed by the Bush administration in 2007, and they countered the GOP’s due-process concerns by noting that the legislation provided for “a quick and speedy appeals process.” Feinstein cited a report from the Government Accountability Office finding that 265 people in the terrorist database had passed a background check to buy a gun. “Our laws are riddled with loopholes,” she said. “A background check really isn’t enough.”', 'title': 'Could Congress Have Stopped Omar Mateen From Getting His Guns?', 'url': 'https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/06/closing-the-terror-gun-loophole-might-not-have-stopped-the-orlando-massacre/486863/', 'keywords': ['stopped', 'mateen', 'getting', 'told', 'gun', 'legislation', 'fbi', 'buy', 'democrats', 'witness', 'omar', 'congress', 'background', 'guns', 'bill'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Mateen told investigators he made the statements out of anger, and the FBI closed the inquiry.\nTwo months later, however, his name surfaced again when the FBI learned that Mateen had “casually” known an American citizen who had committed a suicide bombing for the al-Nusra front in Syria.\nAnother witness told investigators he was concerned about Mateen because he mentioned the recruitment videos of the notorious American imam, Anwar al-Awlaki.\nBut after Mateen turned his life around, got married, and secured a job, the witness said, he was no longer worried.\n“You shouldn’t be able to exploit loopholes and evade criminal background checks by buying online or at a gun show.', 'date': 1465902000}, {'text': 'WFLA - TAMPA, Fla.

The British Independent would report in its article, “ Omar Mateen: Orlando gay club gunman identified by police ,” that:\n\nPolice have identified the gunman in the mass shooting at a gay club in Florida as 29-year-old Omar Mateen, an American citizen whose parents are from Afghanistan.\n\nAuthorities in Orlando said they were investigating the shooting as an act of terrorism, as the death toll rose to 50 with a further 53 wounded.\n\nAt face value – it appears to be another senseless tragedy perpetrated by a “terrorist” inspired by militant groups the US claims to have been fighting for now nearly two decades. However, the Independent reports another fact further down in the body of its article, claiming that:\n\nABC News reported he had been on police’s “radar”, though not subject to an investigation.\n\nIf this sounds like a familiar narrative, that’s because virtually every high-profile “terrorist attack” carried out in North America and Europe in recent years has been done so by suspects long under investigation by US, Canadian, and European law enforcement and intelligence agencies.\n\nCNN’s article, “50 killed in Florida nightclub, shooter pledged ISIS allegiance,” would further elaborate on Mateen’s background, stating:\n\n\n\nTwo officials tell CNN that the FBI had investigated Mateen at some point for possibly having ties to or sympathizing with Islamic extremism. A law enforcement official said there were two cases opened involving Mateen but the probes didn’t result in enough evidence to charge him with anything.\n\nIn the past two weeks Mateen legally purchased a Glock pistol, found at the shooting scene, from a St. Lucie County area gun store, a law enforcement official said.\n\nWhat CNN fails to mention is the long history the FBI has of taking “sympathizers” through a series of steps to acquire “enough evidence,” including posing as terrorists and providing suspects with weapons and plans for attacks precisely like the one that just unfolded in Florida.\n\nTo understand the implications of yet another high-profile terror attack involving a suspect already known to law enforcement agencies, one must examine previous examples of admittedly set-up attacks “foiled” at the last moment by the FBI, as well as attacks that have been carried out by individuals tracked for years and even arrested multiple times by Western police and intelligence agencies only to be let go time and time again until finally carrying out “the big one.”\n\nISIS Inspired? Or FBI Inspired? FBI Set Up Multiple Attacks in 2015 Almost Exactly Like the Florida Shooting\n\nA terror suspect armed to the teeth storming a public place and killing scores is actually a very familiar script. The FBI wrote several such scripts in 2015 alone, including entrapping and arresting a mentally-ill suspect after providing him with an arsenal of deadly weapons almost identical to the arsenal recently employed in Florida.\n\nThe Intercept would report in its article, “Another “Terror” Arrest; Another Mentally Ill Man, Armed by the FBI,” that:\n\nU.S. law enforcement officials announced another terror arrest on Monday, after arming a mentally ill man and then charging him with having guns.\n\nABC News quoted a “senior federal official briefed on the arrest” as saying: “This is a very bad person arrested before he could do very bad things.”\n\nBut in a sting reminiscent of so many others conducted by the FBI since 9/11, Alexander Ciccolo, 23, “aka Ali Al Amriki,” was apparently a mentally ill man who was doing nothing more than ranting about violent jihad and talking (admittedly in frightening ways) about launching attacks—until he met an FBI informant. At that point, he started making shopping lists for weapons.\n\nThe Intercept would also reference the FBI’s affidavit (.pdf), stating (emphasis added):\n\nAccording to the affidavit, Ciccolo first talked to the FBI informant about attacking two bars and a police station. Later, he spoke of attacking a college campus with a homemade pressure-cooker bomb like the one used in the Boston Marathon terror attack; he also talked about using guns and a lot of ammo. Ciccolo, according to the affidavit, then “ordered the firearms from a confidential human source (“CHS”) working with the FBI.”\n\nThe list of weapons provided to the mentally-ill suspect by the FBI informant is shocking. Revealed in the official FBI affidavit (.pdf), the weapons included a 9mm Glock 17, a 10mm Glock 20, a .223 Colt AR-15 rifle, (referred to by the media as an “assault rifle”), and a 556 Sig Arms SG550 rifle (also often referred to as an assault rifle). Also included in the affidavit is the same hysterical rhetoric encouraged by FBI informants now evident in the recent actions of terror suspect Omar Mateen in Florida.\n\nImage: The FBI literally handed these weapons to a mentally ill man who was contemplating attacking bars, police stations, and university campuses. Two of the four weapons were Glocks, a weapon used by Mateen in the recent Florida shooting. Both the 2015 patsy and Mateen also appeared to have been in possession of improvised explosive devices.\n\nThe FBI literally provided a mentally ill man they helped plan a terrorist attack together with, an arsenal of deadly weapons – arresting him just before he committed his crime. The only factor that prevented the 2015 entrapment of Ciccolo from becoming a live Florida shooting-style attack was the fact that the FBI arrested Ciccolo before he carried out his planned attack – while those following Mateen did not arrest him.\n\nThe role of the FBI in Mateen obtaining his weapons will never be known since Mateen is now – conveniently – dead. Even if he purchased them “legally” at a gun store, it should be noted that in other FBI entrapment cases, suspects were encouraged to purchase weapons themselves, with the FBI arresting them only after they left gun stores with their newly acquired arsenal.\n\nImage: Another patsy set up by the FBI in 2015 was allowed to purchase two semi-automatic rifles at a gun store before being arrested upon leaving with the weapons.\n\nNBC Cincinnati affiliate WLWT5 would report in their 2015 article, “FBI: Cincinnati man bought rifles, planned to attack U.S. Capitol,” that (emphasis added):\n\nAgents said that on Tuesday and Wednesday Cornell met with the informant the final time to plan their trip to D.C. to execute their plan. He purchased two Armalite M-15 5.56 mm semi-automatic rifles Wednesday morning, along with 600 rounds of ammunition, and was arrested.\n\nCornell bought the rifles at the Point Blank gun store on Harrison Avenue in Colerain Township. He passed a background check and paid $1,900 in cash, $700 for each rifle and about $400 for the ammunition.\n\nThe gun store owner, John Dean, said FBI agents notified him that Cornell was going to come in to buy the guns about 10 minutes before he entered the store.\n\nDean said the agents told him to allow the purchase and agents would stop Cornell after he left the store.\n\nWhat if agents didn’t stop him after he left the store? He had two semi-automatic rifles and 800 rounds of ammunition – more than enough to carry out a Florida shooting-style attack. Some may be immediately tempted to conclude that the FBI would never allow an attack they played a role in planning to go “live.” However, they would be wrong.\n\nA Notorious FBI-Staged Attack that Went Live\n\nThe FBI in fact was presiding over the terrorists who carried out the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The role of the FBI leading up to the deadly attack would most likely have gone unreported had an FBI informant not taped his conversations with FBI agents after growing suspicious during the uncover operation. The New York Times in their article, “Tapes Depict Proposal to Thwart Bomb Used in Trade Center Blast,” reported:\n\nLaw-enforcement officials were told that terrorists were building a bomb that was eventually used to blow up the World Trade Center, and they planned to thwart the plotters by secretly substituting harmless powder for the explosives, an informer said after the blast.\n\nThe informer was to have helped the plotters build the bomb and supply the fake powder, but the plan was called off by an F.B.I. supervisor who had other ideas about how the informer, Emad A. Salem, should be used, the informer said.\n\nThe account, which is given in the transcript of hundreds of hours of tape recordings Mr. Salem secretly made of his talks with law-enforcement agents, portrays the authorities as in a far better position than previously known to foil the Feb. 26 bombing of New York City’s tallest towers. The explosion left six people dead, more than 1,000 injured and damages in excess of half a billion dollars.\n\nThe FBI and other US, Canadian, and European law enforcement and intelligence agencies “accidentally” failing to stop terror suspects they have long known about and have even arrested multiple times has since become endemic. In recent years, virtually every suspect has either been known by such agencies beforehand, or has been involved in a history of crime and terrorism before carrying out their final acts of grand terrorism.\n\nSuch was the case in the various French attacks. Many from the network that carried out the French attacks were then directly involved in the Belgium attacks. To explain away the fact that virtually all the suspects had been within European security agencies’ grasp for yearsbut were still able to carry out their deadly attacks – the Western media has attempted to cite a lack of resources.\n\nIn reality, what is playing out is an engineered strategy of tension using both the threat of terrorism and actual terrorism to create hysteria, fear, division, and ultimately obedience and capitulation across Western populations.\n\nIt should be remembered that Al Qaeda itself began as a US-Saudi joint venture to fight proxy warfare against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan where conventional Western forces could not go. It should also be pointed out that since then, Al Qaeda and its more recent affiliate, the self-proclaimed “Islamic State,” have enjoyed logistical support from the US and NATO for years in proxy wars ranging from Libya to Syria to Iraq and the frontiers of Iran, southern Russia, and western China.\n\nMore recently it has been admitted even within the Western press that the “Islamic State” is being resupplied and reinforced from NATO territory itself, with the UK Telegraph admitting in its article, “US-backed Syrian opposition forces surround Isil in key city and cut off main supply route,” that:\n\n…Syrian opposition forces have completely surrounded the Islamic State-held stronghold of Manbij and cut off the group’s main route to the outside world…..\n\nThe loss of Manbij will be a huge loss to the group. It had been a waypoint on an Isil supply line between the Turkish border and the extremist group’s de facto capital, Raqqa.\n\nAgain, we see that while the US claims to fight the “Islamic State,” its NATO partner Turkey is quite literally the source of the terrorist organization’s fighting capacity, with US forces permanently stationed in Turkey for decades and Turkey having been a NATO member since the 1950s. Despite open acknowledgments that the “Islamic State” is operating out of Turkey, the US has used the presence of the terrorist organization inside Syria as a pretext for intervening in the war directly.\n\nWere the US truly interested in stopping the “Islamic State,” it and its allies in Ankara would be easily able to wield maximum force within Turkey’s territory to cut the group off before it even reached Syrian territory. That both Washington and Ankara are feigning an inexplicable inability to do this, and insist instead that the war must be fought inside Syria exposes the cynical nature with which the West uses – not fights – terrorism to further its geopolitical and domestic political agendas.\n\nAs special interests attempt to leverage this latest terrorist attack – all of these actual facts must be kept in mind to ground us to a reality Western politicians and media outlets will attempt to detach us from in the coming days and weeks.\n\nTony Cartalucci’s articles have appeared on many alternative media websites, including his own atLand Destroyer Report, Alternative Thai News Network and LocalOrg.', 'title': 'Law Enforcement Knew Florida Shooter Before Shooting', 'url': 'https://www.mintpressnews.com/law-enforcement-knew-florida-shooter-shooting/217159/', 'keywords': ['shooting', 'mateen', 'weapons', 'terror', 'western', 'shooter', 'florida', 'article', 'fbi', 'law', 'enforcement', 'attacks', 'attack', 'islamic', 'knew'], 'tags': {'Orlando shooting', 'terrorist attack', 'Omar Mateen', 'FBI', 'ISIS', 'terrorism'}, 'summary': 'A horrific mass shooting unfolded in Florida claiming the lives of at least 52 with scores more injured.\nA law enforcement official said there were two cases opened involving Mateen but the probes didn’t result in enough evidence to charge him with anything.\nIn the past two weeks Mateen legally purchased a Glock pistol, found at the shooting scene, from a St. Lucie County area gun store, a law enforcement official said.\nTwo of the four weapons were Glocks, a weapon used by Mateen in the recent Florida shooting.\nHe had two semi-automatic rifles and 800 rounds of ammunition – more than enough to carry out a Florida shooting-style attack.', 'date': 1465823976}, {'text': 'REFRESH FOR UPDATES\n\nUPDATE, 9:30 AM, June 13: Much being made this morning of media reports clarifying that authorities’ reports Sunday’s 50 deaths at the Orlando club had included the shooter, who was killed at Pulse club after a 3-hour hostage situation.

President Obama this morning held a news briefing at the White House in which he said authorities are conducting a “terrorist investigation” but there is no evidence at this point that the gunman was directed by external ISIS authorities, and indications are the worst mass shooting in US history was an act of “homegrown extremism.”\n\nAdditionally, 48 of those 49 victims have been identified; 36 families of the victims have been notified. Of the 53 wounded in the shooting, more than half remain hospitalized and at least five are in grave condition, authorities said.\n\nUPDATE 2:19 PM: Nihad Awad, executive director of Council on American-Islamic Relations, the country’s largest Muslim-advocacy group, held a news conference strongly condemning today’s Orlando attack and politicians who would “score points” off the mass shooting.\n\n“This is a hate crime, plain and simple. We condemn it,” he said. “For many years members of the LGBTQIA community have stood, shoulder to shoulder, with the Muslim community against any acts of hate crimes, Islamophobia, marginalization, and discrimination. Today we stand with them shoulder to shoulder… As Muslims and Americans, now is the time to speak out and make it clear we will not give in to hate and not give in to war.”\n\nAddressing ISIS, which has taken credit for the attack, he said, “You do not speak for us. You do not represent us. You are an aberration, you are an outlaw.” He also cautioned “politicians who may try to exploit this tragedy,” saying “this is not the time to score points. This is not the time to exploit fear. This is the time for unity and strength.”\n\nUPDATE: 1:30 PM: ISIS has claimed responsibility for the shooting, according to Amaq Agency which reportedly has ties to the organization. “The attack that targeted a nightclub for homosexuals in Orlando, Florida and that left more than 100 dead and wounded was carried out by an Islamic State fighter,” ISIS said in a statement, though some US TV news outlets reporting did so skeptically.\n\nPREVIOUS, 12:48 PM: Major League Baseball has announced all teams today will observe a moment of silence in memory of the Orlando shooting victims:\n\nAll MLB clubs are observing a moment of silence in memory of the #Orlando victims. https://t.co/FVnQ5gOF4fhttps://t.co/e8aiH6k1tb — MLB (@MLB) June 12, 2016\n\nPREVIOUS, 11:04 AM: “Though it is still early…we know enough to say it was an act of terror and of hate,” President Obama said in a five-minute speech from the White House about the early morning slaughter of 50 in Orlando that is the worst mass shooting in U.S. history.\n\nObama took no question, and today ordered the U.S. flag to be flown at half staff at the White House and government and military buildings, bases and vessels worldwide, until June 16.\n\nMeanwhile, the presumptive GOP and Dem party candidates to replace Obama, tweeted:\n\nIs President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism?

The 29-year-old was trained as a private security guard, his parents are from Afghanistan, he was on “on the FBI’s radar,” suspected of being an ISIS sympathizer, though authorities did not have knowledge of a planned attack, Tapper said.\n\nThe suspect called 911 in the course of the hostage situation at the nightclub, his support to ISIS, and mentioned 2013 Boston Marathon bombers, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.\n\nThe suspect is a private security guard, working for a “major company” that provides services for the federal government, news outlets reported. That security guard license enabled him to obtain weapons with a minimum questions asked, including the semi automatic weapon he had purchased legally in the last couple weeks.\n\nThe shooting began when an off-duty police officer working security at the gay nightclub exchanged fire with the suspect at the club door; the gunman ran inside, creating a hostage situation at the packed club. The hostage situation lasted about three hours.\n\nMateen had been interviewed twice by the FBI in 2013, after he made “inflammatory comments” to co-workers alleging possible “terrorist ties,” according to Ron Hopper, FBI special agent in charge of its Orlando office. Mateen was interviewed again in ’14 for possible ties to an American suicide bomber; FBI found both investigations “inconclusive” Hopper added.\n\nPREVIOUS: “In two successive nights we’ve had killings (in Orlando),” Sen. Bill Nelson (D-FL) told reporters in a news conference. “The singer performing live at the Plaza shot down two nights ago and then his horrific act. So what is happening to our country? We are going to have to dig down deep and ask ourselves who we are as a people. We’ve got to think of ourselves as common denominator Americans, not as hyphenated-Americans off on some cause.”\n\nGov. Rick Scott also held a news conference announcing he had declared a state of emergency in the county where the shooting took place to make sure state resources would be made available immediately to organizations dealing with the aftermath of the mass shooting. He deflected reporters’ questions about gun control: “Right now, this is the time to find out exactly what happened…time to pray for those that have lost their lives.”\n\nPresidential candidates responded this morning:\n\nAppreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don\'t want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance.

We weren’t aware of any action he is taking. We are in shock like the whole country. This has nothing to do with religion.” Geist said the father “claims his son got angry when saw two men kissing in downtown Miami a couple months ago and says he thinks that may have caused this.”\n\nAnd NBC News’ former evening news anchor Tom Brokaw early this morning said: “It should be part of the political debate” and both parties should discuss gun control in “rational fashion.”\n\nIndustry reactions began coming as word of the shooting spread:\n\nSobbing. — Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) June 12, 2016\n\nHard to contemplate devastating news of worst mass shooting in US history in Orlando at LGBT club.

The shooting, which, at last count, left 50 dead and 53 injured is the worst mass shooting in American history.\n\n“There are a lot of dead bodies in the club,” a tearful woman told ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos in one of the morning’s most heart-rending moments. Her son was inside the club and unaccounted for, and her emotional interview seemed to leave Stephanopoulos momentarily stunned. At approximately 6:15 AM and 10:15 AM ET, and throughout, ABC’s This Week broke into special reports to cover the shooting, as all of the Sunday Beltway shows scrambled to re-focus.\n\nCNN, like other news organizations, was converging on Florida, with correspondent Boris Sanchez in Orlando, and Erin Burnett, Alisyn Camerota and Carol Costello en route. Victor Blackwell and Pam Brown will anchor from Orlando today. Also Orlando-bound for CNN are Chris Cuomo, Don Lemon, John Berman and John Vause.\n\nFox News Channel plans special live editions of its America’s Newsroom program from noon to 7 PM ET, anchored by Eric Shawn, Arthel Neville, Shannon Bream, Leland Vittert, Jon Scott and Heather Nauert. Chief political anchor Bret Baier will anchor the 11AM/ET and 1PM/ET hours. Continuing into the evening, Fox Report Sunday hosted by Harris Faulkner will be live \u202aat 7PM/ET before Bill O’Reilly takes over for a live edition of The O’Reilly Factor at 8PM/ET. Megyn Kelly’s show will be live as well. Legends & Lies, scheduled to air from 8-9PM/ET will be pre-empted.\n\nOn Fox News Sunday, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) warned Baier “More of these attacks are coming,” stomping for the need to “address it openly and directly, and say directly there is an extremist element within Islam that is dangerous and has to be confronted, we need to slow down.”\n\nFor ABC News, correspondent Lauren Lyster started reporting on the shooting overnight; Linzie Janis jumped in to early coverage. Anchor Amy Robach and correspondent Gio Benitez were en route, as were Senior Justice Correspondent Pierre Thomas, NewsOne Correspondents Marci Gonzalez and Liz Hur, and radio correspondent Jim Ryan. ABC News’ Chief Investigative Correspondent Brian Ross is reporting from New York.\n\nToday‘s Willie Geist contacted the shooter’s father, who, according to Geist, “claims his son got angry when he saw two men kissing in downtown Miami a couple months ago and says he thinks that may have caused this.”\n\nThe White House, which said that President Barack Obama will address the nation at 1:30 pm ET, released the following statement:\n\n“The President was briefed this morning by Lisa Monaco, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, on the tragic shooting in Orlando, Florida. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of the victims. The President asked to receive regular updates as the FBI, and other federal officials, work with the Orlando Police to gather more information, and directed that the federal government provide any assistance necessary to pursue the investigation and support the community.”\n\nThe shooter was identified by law enforcement as Omar Mateen, an American citizen from Port St. Lucie, Fla. The shooting at the Pulse nightclub, which began at about 2 AM ET Sunday, is being described by local officials as domestic terrorism and a hate crime.\n\nThe shooting put Orlando, home of Disney World, in the national spotlight for the second time in as many days, following the murder of The Voice finalist Christina Grimmie following an Orlando concert Friday night.\n\nAt the Pulse club, police exchanged fire with the gunman following a three-hour hostage stand-off, killing the man described by the FBI as an Islamist radical.

(AFP Photo)\n\nAt a high school in Florida, students watched the horrors of Sept. 11, 2001, unfold on live TV. When the second hijacked airliner slammed into World Trade Center\'s south tower, the class watched in stunned disbelief. One student, however, "started jumping up-and-down cheering on the terrorist."That was sophomore Omar Mateen, according to one of the accounts from Martin County High School recalling 9/11 and the reaction by the classmate who, nearly 15 years later, would carry out the worst mass shooting in U.S. history.The recollections of Mateen\'s actions could not be independently verified and the memories could be clouded by the years that have passed. But they appear to offer yet another stitch into the wider tapestry of Mateen\'s life and views before Sunday\'s rampage, which included his pledge of loyalty to the Islamic State during a call to police during the standoff.Robert Zirkle, then a freshman at the Martin County school, said he saw Mateen excited and making fun of how America was being attacked on 9/11. "He was making plane noises on the bus, acting like he was running into a building," Zirkle recalled."I don\'t really know if he was doing it cause he was being taught some of that stuff at home or just doing it for attention because he didn\'t have a lot of friends.""Before 9/11 happened we were pretty straight. We all rode the same bus. We weren\'t really close friends, but friends at least a little," he added. "After 9/11 happened, he started changing and acting different."Hours after the carnage on Sunday in Orlando, several classmates from Mateen\'s school days at Martin County High School and Spectrum Alternative School began talking in group chat on Facebook.One former student told Zirkle on Facebook that on 9/11 the students were watching the TV in class. On the group chat, the former student wrote that Mateen "stood up in class during the 9/11 attack and after the second plane hit the building he started jumping up-and-down cheering on the terrorist."In a phone interview, a third classmate who did not want to speak by name for fear of being bombarded by media, said he remembers Mateen acting out in class when the towers were hit because both of them were sent to the dean\'s office at the same time for misbehaving."I was sleeping in class and woke up to see people jumping off buildings, so I started swearing and they sent me up," the student said. "But Omar was saying some really rude stuff. Stuff like. \'That\'s what America deserves.\' That kind of thing. It wasn\'t right."Both that student and Zirkle recalled Mateen being suspended or expelled from the school shortly after 9/11."He got bullied a lot," said the student who sat at the dean\'s office with Mateen. "It may have been because he was Muslim. But high school can be rough, people can pick on you just because [of] your name.""They had to escort him out of the school," Zirkle said. "Other kids were trying to fight him. A couple days after, they had to take him off the bus.""A few of my friends wanted to fight him because he kept doing it and saying crazy things," he added. "It\'s weird. He was totally cool before 9/11 and then something changed."In another later incident, Zirkle said Mateen told some of his friends in class that Osama bin Laden was his uncle, which started another fight.

I don\'t even remember breathing. I just remember dragging my best friend down," Burbano told ABC News.\n\nAs he was trying to get out of the club, called Pulse Orlando, which bills itself on its website as "Orlando\'s Premier Gay Night Club," Burbano said it was somewhat difficult because there was "everything from drinks on the floor to blood."\n\nOnce there was a break in the shooting, Burbano said that he and his friends "started jetting toward the side exit" but as they headed in that direction, "the volume of the gunshots started getting closer and louder."\n\n"I lost my shirt because I used them as tourniquets," he said, telling of how he saw one man who "lost half his arm and this other man was walking around with a bullet in his leg and he had no idea."\n\nBrandon Wolf was another one of the patrons who survived.

"We are resilient. And we know that love trumps hate."\n\nOrlando Sentinel via Getty Images\n\nPeople waved LGBT pride and American flags. Countless hugs were exchanged. At one point, many joined in chanting, "Peace. Love. Pulse."\n\nBefore the vigil, Charles Schaeffer, 27, could be found piecing together a massive ribbon with the gay pride colors and a series of signs he\'d painted, which read, "One city/one family/one love/one heart/one pulse."\n\n"I knew a lot of staff, managers, patrons" of Pulse, Schaeffer told The Huffington Post. "Some made it out. Some didn\'t."\n\nRoque Planas/Huffington Post Thousands converged at the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts in Orlando to remember those lost in the mass shooting on Sunday. Speakers declared, "We are stronger than fear. Love will conquer hate. Orlando united!"\n\nAmong those in attendance were Francesca Garcia and Kimberly Mas, production assistants at the Telemundo show "La Voz." They held a poster board covered with photos of their friend and co-worker Jonathan Camuy, 24, who died inside the club. Both remembered Camuy as a joyful young man who had a way of infecting others with his optimism and loved to dance.\n\n"That\'s what he was doing there that night," Mas said.\n\n"It\'s such a loss," Garcia added.\n\nRoque Planas/The Huffington Post Francesca Garcia sits with a poster adorned with photos of her friend Jonathan Camuy, who died during Sunday\'s shooting.\n\nAlex Carella, 34, who was born and raised in Orlando, told HuffPost he\'s never felt such sadness and so much love all at once.\n\n"This community is beautiful," Carella said. "Look at all the people who came here to support. Love is real."\n\nIn a powerful and moving tribute, each of the victim\'s names was read aloud. Later, people held flickering candles and stood in absolute silence as the ringing of a bell echoed through the plaza 49 times -- once for each victim. The front of the performance center shined in colors of the rainbow.\n\nTeri Sautner, 22, said she came to Miami to be there with family and friends.\n\n"I had to come because we can\'t let hate win," she told HuffPost.\n\nAndy Campbell/Huffington Post Thousands converged at the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts in Orlando to remember those lost in the mass shooting on Sunday. Speakers declared, "We are stronger than fear. Love will conquer hate. Orlando united!"\n\nMuhammad Musri, an imam at the Islamic Society of Central Florida, told the crowd it was a tragedy that anyone who professed to believe in "our peaceful faith" would carry out such a horrific act.\n\n"We are deeply hurt. Our lives are broken," Musri said. "We condemn the ideology of hate."\n\nOrange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs said that she was proud of those who showed up Monday and that the Orlando community has come too far in its fight for equality to give in to fear and hatred.\n\n"This is no longer your fight, this is our fight," Jacobs said.

He moved with his mother from metro Detroit to Florida.\n\nLeinonen’s last moments were spent with his partner inside Pulse, the gay nightclub gunman Omar Mateen attacked.\n\nWhile his mother frantically waited outside the club for word on her son, his father, Mark Bando, was in Farmington Hills watching the horror unfold on the TV.\n\nBando, who spent 25 years as a Detroit police officer, said it still doesn’t seem real.\n\n“I’ll tell you about my son," Bando said. "He was always a people lover, unlike me. I always saw the worst of people for 25 years as a Detroit cop.”\n\nBando said his son used to tease him about carrying his service revolver off duty, telling him he was paranoid.\n\n“I’d tell him, \'There’s evil in the world out there, son,\' and he didn’t want to believe it.\'”\n\nLeinonen and his mother moved to Florida before he started high school.\n\n“If he had lived near me up here, I would have taught him how to handle guns and he would have had a CPL. If someone in that place had a pistol, they should have put a stop to it and saved a lot of lives,” Bando said.\n\nThe second Michigan man officials identified was Tevin Eugene Crosby, 25.\n\nHe was a businessman from Michigan who recently went to Orlando.

In such tight quarters, the bullets could hardly miss. He shot at police. He took hostages.\n\nWhen the gunfire at the Pulse Orlando club finally stopped, 50 people were dead and dozens critically wounded in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

That’s how he was shooting at people,” he said.\n\n“My first thought was, oh my God, I’m going to die,” Alamo said. “I was praying to God that I would live to see another day.”\n\nPulse patron Eddie Justice texted his mother, Mina: “Mommy I love you.

His family later moved to Florida, authorities said.\n\nA law enforcement official said the gunman made a 911 call from the club in which he professed allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The official was familiar with the investigation, but was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe extremist group did not officially claim responsibility for the attack, but the IS-run Aamaq news agency cited an unnamed source as saying the attack was carried out by an Islamic State fighter.\n\nEven if the attacker supported IS, it was unclear whether the group planned or knew of the attack beforehand.\n\nMateen was not unknown to law enforcement: In 2013, he made inflammatory comments to co-workers and was interviewed twice, according to FBI agent Ronald Hopper, who called the interviews inconclusive. In 2014, Hopper said, officials found that Mateen had ties to an American suicide bomber, but the agent described the contact as minimal, saying it did not constitute a threat at the time.\n\nAsked if the gunman had a connection to radical Islamic terrorism, Hopper said authorities had “suggestions that individual has leanings towards that.”\n\nMateen purchased at least two firearms legally within the last week or so, according to Trevor Velinor of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.\n\nIn a separate incident, an Indiana man armed with three assault rifles and chemicals used to make explosives was arrested Sunday in Southern California and told police he was headed to a West Hollywood gay pride parade.\n\nThe Orlando shooting started about 2 a.m., with more than 300 people inside the Pulse.\n\n“He had an automatic rifle, so nobody stood a chance,” said Jackie Smith, who saw two friends next to her get shot. “I just tried to get out of there.”\n\nAt 2:09 a.m., Pulse posted on its Facebook page: “Everyone get out of Pulse and keep running.”\n\nMateen exchanged gunfire with 14 police officers at the club, and took hostages at one point.

It was almost surreal how happy he was about what happened to us.\n\nThe former student, who spoke anonymously to the Post for fear of his business clients learning that he attended an alternative school, said Mateen also claimed that Osama bin Laden was his uncle.\n\nAnother former classmate told the Post that Mateen started acting out after the two towers were hit, and that he was sent to the dean\'s office with Mateen for misbehaving.\n\n\'I was sleeping in class and woke up to see people jumping off buildings, so I started swearing and they sent me up,\' the former student said. \'But Omar was saying some really rude stuff.

A couple days after, they had to take him off the bus.\'\n\n\'A few of my friends wanted to fight him because he kept doing it and saying crazy things,\' he added. \'It\'s weird.

"Those interviews turned out to be inconclusive, so there was nothing to keep the investigation going." He was not under investigation at the time of Sunday\'s shooting and was not under surveillance, Hopper said.\n\nMateen was the subject of the 2013 investigation after making comments to co-workers about terrorist ties. The next year, Mateen was interviewed over possible connections to an American suicide bomber. He was not considered a priority subject.\n\nSuspected ISIS sympathizer: Law enforcement officials say Mateen was known to the FBI, one of hundreds of people suspected of being ISIS sympathizers who are on the FBI\'s radar, according to two law enforcement officials. There was no indication he was plotting to carry out an attack, the officials said. Investigators haven\'t found evidence to show he was acting on behalf of ISIS. But the knowledge about his possible sympathies explains why they are treating the case as likely Islamic-related terror.\n\nNo claim of responsibility: There has been no claim of responsibility for the Orlando nightclub terror attack on jihadi forums, but ISIS sympathizers reacted by praising the attack on pro-Islamic State forums, according to CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank.\n\nLocal mosque reaction: The imam at the Fort Pierce Islamic Center, Syed Shafeeq Rahman, said Mateen was playful and more social when young but had recently kept to himself. He would come to the mosque two or three times a week for two hours and talk to no one. Rahman said he was at Friday prayers -- his usual routine. Rahman said Mateen had been coming to the mosque since 2003. The imam appealed for peace saying: "We have to stop the killing and bloodshed."\n\nHigh school classmates remember odd statement: Two former high school classmates remember Mateen saying something to the effect Osama bin Laden was his uncle, which caused a lot of brushback from other students. The classmates said that the September 11 attacks seemed to be a significant moment for him and recounted how his mental health may have been affected.\n\nThe guns: The shooter purchased a handgun and a long gun within the last few days, Trevor Velinor Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives told reporters. "He is not a prohibited person. They can legally walk into a gun dealership and acquire and purchase firearms. He did so. And he did so within the last week or so," Velinor said.\n\nAdditional gun found and other details: Investigators recovered an additional gun in the shooter\'s car. It\'s a .38-caliber Smith and Wesson revolver, according to a law enforcement official. The ATF is working to trace it. The other two firearms were a Sig Sauer rifle and a Glock pistol, which were traced to the shooter. He bought those two recently (June 4 and 5).\n\nEmployment: Mateen worked as a security guard -- allowing him to have a firearms license and minimal background checks when buying firearms. According to a neighbor who saw him regularly, Mateen was a security guard at the St. Lucie County Courthouse. The neighbor said Mateen often worked security in the front of the building, manning the metal detectors.\n\nCaution around claim of responsibility: A message was posted in Arabic on a Dark Web Telegraph site associated with the ISIS news agency Amaq. Some officials have cited the message as a claim of responsibility by ISIS.\n\nHere is CNN\'s translation: "Sources for Amaq News Agency: the armed attack that targeted a gay nightclub in the city of Orlando in the American state of Florida and that bore more than 100 killed and wounded was carried out by an Islamic state fighter."\n\nBut CNN\'s Salma Abdelaziz, who translated the message and closely monitors ISIS messaging, said:\n\n--The language is inconsistent with previous ISIS announcements.\n\n-- In particular, the Arabic word for gay was used rather than an epithet, the usual approach for ISIS.\n\n-- There was no claim the attack was directed, just an after-the-fact claim the gunman was an ISIS fighter.\n\nVictims\n\nStanley Almodovar III, 23\n\nAmanda Alvear, 25\n\nOscar A Aracena-Montero, 26\n\nRodolfo Ayala-Ayala, 33\n\nAntonio Davon Brown, 29\n\nDarryl Roman Burt II, 29\n\nAngel L.

He didn\'t seem like the kind of guy who just did what he did," Callen said. "It makes no sense."\n\nYet Mateen expressed outrage to his father after seeing two men kissing in Miami, investigators said.\n\nMateen was born in New York on November 16, 1986. His parents are originally from Afghanistan. Most recently, Mateen lived in Fort Pierce, Florida.\n\nHis father, Seddique Mateen, said his son didn\'t have any mental health issues and showed no signs of being radicalized.\n\n"His act was a terror act, but as far (as) him being a terrorist, I\'m not aware," the father said\n\nThe family of the shooter told investigators Mateen wasn\'t particularly religious from what they saw.\n\nMateen\'s ex-wife told investigators he had issues with anger.

Add Interest\n\n“Sometimes he would be there for a few weeks at a time and maybe on the weekends, and then you wouldn’t see him for a little while, then you’d see him again, and that’s the way it kind of went,” said 71-year-old James Van Horn, who has frequented Pulse.\n\nTwo people who worked at the club said they also recognized Mateen as a customer. One of them, head of security Estella Peterkin, said she had to kick him out multiple times for bad behavior.\n\nThe revelations about Mateen come as the FBI delves into his life, capitalizing on two major developments: the successful exploitation of his cellphone and the cooperation of his wife, 30-year-old Noor Mateen. A senior counterterrorism official told ABC News that Noor Mateen is providing key information to investigators.\n\nFBI Director James Comey said Monday, “We are going through the killer’s life, as I said, especially his electronics, to understand as much as we can about his path and whether there were anyone else involved either in directing him or in assisting him.”\n\nFBI agents are hearing accounts of Omar Mateen’s presence at gay clubs going back years.\n\nA former classmate at a police academy — who requested he not be identified — told ABC News that Mateen hung out with him and others, frequenting Florida gay bars while they were at the Indian River State College training program, as far back as 2006.\n\nOne night, he said, Mateen asked him if he was gay. “You would be my kind of guy,” the classmate said Mateen told him.\n\nEmployees and patrons at Pulse told ABC News that Mateen went to the bar on a regular basis.\n\nChris Callen, a performer at the club, said Mateen “didn’t seem homophobic to me.”\n\n“He seemed really warm,” Callen said. “I don’t get the terrorist part of it.”\n\n“He would try to meet people and try to bump up against people and put his arm around and maybe try to dance with them or something, because that’s what everybody tries to do,” Van Horn said.\n\nAnother Florida man, Kevin West, told ABC News’ Houston affiliate, KTRK, that he was contacted by Mateen on a gay dating app.\n\n“When he first contacted me, he was asking ... what clubs are popping and things of that sort and what are good places to go,” West said.\n\nThe purported behavior appears severely at odds with how Mateen said he felt about gay people, according to his ex-wife, Sitora Yusufiy, who was married to Mateen briefly in 2009.\n\n“I started noticing in his emotional instability. He would express his anger towards [a] certain culture, homosexuality, because in ... Islamic culture, it is really not tolerated, homosexuality, and I know at the time he was trying to get his life straight and follow his faith. I guess that created some confusion between that, and there was definitely moments that he would express his intolerance to homosexuals,” she said Monday.\n\nToday Yusufiy said Mateen had told her that he used to go out to night clubs “a lot,” but never said they were gay clubs.\n\n“Do I think he was gay?... At this point, I think he might have been,” she said. “You know, knowing somebody and living with them every day... I can honestly say I had no clue. But from everything that has occurred and connecting the pieces to what I knew myself from my time and experience, I would not be surprised.”\n\nCases in which repressed homosexuality has been linked to extremism have been an interest for counterterrorism officials. In 2011 an analysis of homegrown extremists by the National Counterterrorism Center and obtained by ABC News included a secret report from the CIA that said that for some young men who converted to Islam and later became radicals, the strict religious structure offered “a hope of banishing their impulses and fantasies that they did not view as acceptable.”\n\nJerrold Post, formerly a longtime psychologist with the CIA, told ABC News today that over his career, he has seen the psychodynamic of individuals “striking out against a forbidden part of oneself” but that at this point, it’s too early to leap to conclusions about Mateen’s motives.\n\nMateen was born in New York to Afghan parents in 1986 and has been described by his ex-wife and father as devout in his Muslim faith but not radical. He regularly attended a local mosque, his family said, and twice traveled to Saudi Arabia for pilgrimages to the Islamic holy city of Mecca.\n\nDuring the assault Sunday, officials said he called 911 and pledged his allegiance to ISIS, the Syrian-based Islamic terrorist group. But terrorism experts said evidence has yet to surface showing any substantive link to the group, and Comey said it does not appear that the attack was directed from abroad. The FBI investigated Mateen in 2013 for purportedly inflammatory claims he made about being linked to extremists, but after 10 months of surveillance and two interviews with him, agents determined that he was not a threat and closed the case.\n\n“Is this an expression of radical Islam? Or does it have to do with the conflicted feelings about homosexuality?” said Post, now a professor of psychology at the Elliot School of International Affairs at George Washington University. “That’s an unnecessary separation. One can be, on the one hand, fighting against the perhaps inner attraction of homosexuality and at the same time honoring the act by saying he was a radical Islamist. It doesn’t have to be one or the other. But at this point, it’s all speculation.”\n\nABC News’ Michael Del Moro, Monica Escobido, Stephanie Wash, Zoe Lake, Randy Kreider and Lee Ferran contributed to this report.', 'title': 'Witnesses Say Orlando Shooter at Gay Clubs on a Regular Basis', 'url': 'https://abcnews.go.com/US/witnesses-orlando-shooter-regular-gay-clubs/story?id=39839464', 'keywords': ['gay', 'mateen', 'told', 'thats', 'abc', 'homosexuality', 'try', 'shooter', 'say', 'regular', 'radical', 'witnesses', 'clubs', 'basis', 'orlando', 'point'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'The man who killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Omar Mateen, was a regular patron of gay clubs in Florida for years, club employees, acquaintances and former classmates told ABC News.\n“You would be my kind of guy,” the classmate said Mateen told him.\nEmployees and patrons at Pulse told ABC News that Mateen went to the bar on a regular basis.\nAnother Florida man, Kevin West, told ABC News’ Houston affiliate, KTRK, that he was contacted by Mateen on a gay dating app.\nToday Yusufiy said Mateen had told her that he used to go out to night clubs “a lot,” but never said they were gay clubs.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'Unfortunately, our website is currently unavailable in most European countries.

According to the Associated Press, Mateen had a firearms license since at least 2011, and it was set to expire in 2017. He had worked as a security guard and also passed his employer\'s background checks.\n\nFlorida is generally considered to be a state with minimal restrictions on firearms purchases, Horace said. There are flags on persons prohibited from buying firearms in Florida, however, including convicted felons, according to an ATF spokesman. Mateen had no criminal history, but he had been on federal radar in recent years.\n\nAccording to FBI Agent Ron Hopper, Mateen first came to the FBI\'s attention in 2013 when he made inflammatory comments to co-workers alleging possible ties to terrorism. He told co-workers and others he knew the Tsarnaev brothers, a U.S. intelligence source told CBS News.\n\nHopper says the claims were "thoroughly investigated" and Mateen was interviewed twice. But officials couldn\'t verify the substance of the comments, and the investigation was closed.\n\nMateen again surfaced on federal radar in 2014, Hopper said, as someone who may have had ties to a suicide bomber. Mateen was again interviewed, but investigators determined the contact was minimal and didn\'t constitute a threat.\n\nMateen was not on a current terror watchlist, a U.S. intelligence source tells CBS News.

Ebenhack/AP Photo)\n\nORLANDO, Fla. — A gunman armed with an assault rifle killed 50 people at a packed gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida on Sunday in the worst mass shooting in U.S. history which President Barack Obama described as an act of terror and hate.\n\nPolice killed the shooter at the Pulse nightclub, who was identified as Omar S. Mateen, a 29-year-old Florida resident and U.S. citizen. A top U.S. congressman said Mateen may have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State militant group.\n\nU.S. officials cautioned, however, that they had no immediate evidence of any direct connection with Islamic State or any other foreign extremist group, nor had they uncovered any contacts between the gunman and any such group.\n\n\n\n\n\n“We know enough to say this was an act of terror, an act of hate,” Obama said in a speech from the White House. “And as Americans, we are united in grief, in outrage and in resolve to defend our people.”\n\nU.S. officials have reached no definitive judgment on the killer’s precise motives, Obama added. “We must spare no effort to determine what, if any, inspiration or association this killer may have had with terrorist groups,” he said.\n\nThe death toll given by Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer to reporters made the attack the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, eclipsing the 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech university, which left 32 dead.\n\nMayor Dyer: 50 dead in Pulse nightclub shooting. @ChiefJohnMina Suspect had handgun and AR15 type rifle. — Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) June 12, 2016\n\n“Today we’re dealing with something that we never imagined and is unimaginable,” Dyer said. Recalling earlier estimates that 20 people had been killed, he added, “It is with great sadness I share that we not have 20 but 50 casualties (dead), in addition to the shooter. There are another 53 …hospitalized.”\n\nA police officer working as a security guard inside the Pulse nightclub, which has operated in downtown Orlando since 2004 and was hosting some 350 revelers, exchanged fire with the suspect at about 2 a.m. ET, police officials said.\n\n“Everyone get out of pulse and keep running,” the club’s management wrote on Facebook as the incident unfolded.\n\nA hostage situation quickly developed, and three hours later a squad of officers stormed the club and shot dead the gunman. It was unclear when the gunman shot the victims.\n\n“Do we consider this an act of terrorism? Absolutely, we are investigating this from all parties’ perspective as an act of terrorism,” said Danny Banks, special agent in charge of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. “Whether that is domestic terrorist activity or an international one, that is something we will certainly get to the bottom of.”\n\nDozens of terrified patrons, some of whom had been hiding in restrooms, were rescued. One officer was injured when he was hit in his helmet while exchanging fire with the gunman, police said.\n\nRepresentative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on a congressional intelligence committee, noted that the shooting took place during Ramadan, and that ISIS leaders in Syria have urged attacks during this time.\n\n“The target was an LGBT nightclub during Pride, and – if accurate – that according to local law enforcement the shooter declared his allegiance to ISIS, (that) indicates an ISIS-inspired act of terrorism,” Schiff said in a statement.\n\n‘DIFFERENT KIND OF CASE’\n\nU.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who sits on the Senate intelligence and foreign relations committees, told CNN he understood that the gunman had worked for a security company and so would have undergone some background checks.\n\n“Over the next couple of days they’re going to be looking to see where this individual was inspired to carry out this horrifying act of terrorism,” Rubio said. “I think we’re going to be talking about a very different kind of case here soon.”\n\nOur prayers are with those injured and killed early this morning in horrifying act of terror in Orlando. — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) June 12, 2016\n\nPresident Barack Obama on Sunday described the worst massshooting in U.S. history as “an act of terror” and “an act of hate,” saying the massacre of 50 people at a packed gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida was an attack on all Americans.\n\n“Today as Americans we grieve the brutal murder, a horrific massacre of dozens of innocent people,” he said in a statement at the White House.\n\n“Although it is still early in the investigation, we know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate,” Obama said.\n\n“We will not give in to fear or turn against each other. Instead, we will stand united as Americans to protect our people and defend our nation, and to take action against those who threaten us.”\n\nHe ordered the flag at the White House to be flown at half staff to honor the victims.\n\nObama said it was appropriate for the FBI to investigate the massacre as an act of terrorism and said he would “spare no effort” to determine whether the assailant had been inspired or associated with an extremist group.\n\nThe president also termed the shooting a new reminder of “how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school or in a house of worship or a movie theater or in a nightclub,” a reference to other mass killings that have punctuated recent U.S. history.\n\n“We have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be,” he said.\n\n“We stand with the people of #Orlando who have endured a terrible attack on their city." —@POTUS https://t.co/i7fOS3qhYh — The White House (@WhiteHouse) June 12, 2016\n\nPOLICE STORMING SAID TO SAVE 30 LIVES\n\nAt least one officer was injured in the gunbattle but the decision to storm the club saved at least 30 lives, Orlando Police Chief John Mina told a press conference.\n\nOPD first responders and SWAT rescued at least 30 people from inside the club and brought them out alive. pic.twitter.com/KFIdLhxeDI — Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) June 12, 2016\n\nThe suspect was carrying an assault-type rifle and a handgun as well as an unidentified “device”, Mina said.\n\nJaver Antonetti, 53, told the Orlando Sentinel newspaper that he was near the back of the dance club when he heard gunfire. “There were so many (shots), at least 40,” he said. “I saw two guys and it was constant, like ‘pow, pow, pow,’.”\n\nVideo footage showed police officers and civilians carrying injured people away from the club and bending over others who were lying on the ground. Dozens of police cruisers, ambulances and other emergency vehicles could be seen in the area.\n\n“It was one after another after another after another,” Christopher Hansen told CNN, describing the gunshots inside the club. “It could have lasted a whole song.”\n\nPolice said they had carried out a “controlled explosion” at the club hours after the shooting broke out, but did not explain why that was done.\n\nTEARFUL SCENE AT HOSPITAL\n\nSeveral dozen people gathered outside Orlando Regional Medical Center where some of the gunshot victims were being treated. The scene was somber as many people had not been able to reach their loved ones.\n\nHovering by a hospital door they could not enter because of a security lockdown, they checked their cell phones and became tearful when asked for comment.\n\nC.J. Walker, 30, drove the 80 miles (130 km) to Orlando from Tampa seeking information on his sister, one of the nightclub’s DJs. She normally worked on Saturday nights, and he had not been able to reach her by phone or social media. He finally learned that she had not worked on Saturday night and was OK.\n\n“Unfortunately it’s not going to be like this for so many other people,” he said.\n\nIt was the second deadly shooting at an Orlando night spot in as many nights. Late Friday, a man thought to be a deranged fan fatally shot Christina Grimmie, a rising singing star and a former contestant on “The Voice”, as she was signing autographs after a concert in the central Floridacity.\n\nOrlando has a population of 270,930 and is the home of the famed Disney World amusement park and many other tourist attractions that attracted 62 million visitors in 2014.\n\nLIVE on #Periscope: Pulse nightclub shooting update https://t.co/cn3JN3gdTy — Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) June 12, 2016\n\nThis is a developing story.

This piece originally appeared in Slate.\n\nThe attack on the Pulse nightclub in Orlando that killed more than 50 people is not only the deadliest terrorist attack in the United States since 9/11, it is more deadly than all the other jihadist attacks on U.S. soil since then combined. But even though shooter Omar Mateen apparently pledged allegiance to ISIS in a last-minute 911 call, the assault is far from a classic ISIS strike, and we should be wary of conflating two very different kinds of events.\n\nInitial reports indicate that Mateen is a lone wolf, inspired by a terrorist group’s ideology but not under its operational control. Recognizing the difference between “ISIS inspired” and “ISIS directed” attacks is vital. ISIS-inspired attacks are more likely to be amateurish, and indeed the jihadist record of attacks in the United States since 9/11 but prior to Orlando is thankfully poor. The horrific nightclub attack shows what a loner with the right weaponry can do, but when ISIS directs an attack, as it did in Paris in 2015, the results are likely to be even bloodier.\n\nIn Orlando, as in the December San Bernardino shootings, the attack seemed to mix personal motives with an ISIS brand. Because lone wolves operate on their own, their personal agendas often mix with those of the terrorist group they claim to serve. In San Bernardino, the killers struck at a holiday party in the county health department where one of them worked, not exactly the center of the crusader effort to dominate the Middle East. Initial reports suggest Mateen was homophobic: his father claimed that Mateen became upset when he saw two men kissing. Although ISIS hates gays and its Twitter supporters are already celebrating their deaths, it pretty much hates everyone—Christians, Jews, Westerners in general, Shiite and other Muslim minorities, and Sunni Muslims who don’t agree with it. Homosexuals are not particularly high on this list, and indeed ISIS propaganda in the West has not focused on them heavily.\n\nOrlando may be another variant, then, of what the French scholar of Islam Olivier Roy has called the “Islamicization of radicalism.” Islam is used by an individual already on the edge of violence to justify his actions and give him status to at least one audience, as indeed has already happened to Mateen. Details on Mateen’s background are still trickling in, but his ex-wife claimed he was abusive in their marriage and not particularly zealous in his faith.\n\nIn the ISIS-directed Paris attacks, we saw multiple attackers working in teams: The terrorists hit guarded targets like the Stade de France where the French president was watching a soccer match as well as “soft” ones like cafés and restaurants. The final death toll of 130 suggests their effectiveness. Some of the plotters were even able to lie low and were linked to the attack in Brussels several months later. In both San Bernardino and Orlando, however, the suspected shooter died as part of the response to the attack, diminishing the psychological effect that occurs when an active shooter is still out there plotting.\n\nThese attacks that are merely inspired by ISIS sow terror but they are less impressive in their ambitions not only than Paris-style attacks but also attacks attempted by al-Qaida sympathizers in the United States. The 2009 Fort Hood shootings killed soldiers at a military base, a symbol of U.S. power. In 2010 Faisal Shahzad, who trained in Pakistan and claimed inspiration from an al-Qaida-linked cleric, tried to bomb Times Square, striking an internationally recognizable target at the very heart of New York City, which had witnessed the worst terrorist attack in history in 2001. Such targets represent U.S. power and culture, and striking them is recognized as a direct challenge to American power. They are also harder to hit since their symbolic or military importance makes them better defended. The most recent ISIS-inspired attacks do not show any similar logic linked to the organization’s objectives but rather seem more the shooter’s own twisted attempt to make his acts appear heroic.\n\nYet the prevalence of “directed” versus “inspired” terrorists is directly linked. If ISIS is winning overseas—as it appeared to be at its peak in 2014, when the territory under its control was growing, and its enemies routed and dispirited—then the organization’s stature grows and it is better able to attract and inspire recruits and supporters. More practically, if it is able to run large training camps without at most limited interference, as it could do before the U.S.-led intervention in Syria, then it is able to churn out large numbers of skilled gunmen and trained terrorists. As ISIS has lost territory in both Iraq and Syria, the number of foreign fighters flocking to fight under its banner has reportedly plunged.\n\nThis good news carries a downside, however. For years, the group urged foreign volunteers to come to Syria to defend its self-proclaimed Islamic State. Its propaganda noted, however, that if would-be supporters can’t go to defend the group in Syria, they should act in their home countries and kill disbelievers wherever they can. ISIS also regularly executes foreigners it fears it may be spies, and it urges those whose loyalty is in doubt who are in the West to strike there to prove themselves.\n\nStopping lone wolf attacks is exceptionally difficult. When an individual travels abroad to fight in Syria or is in contact with ISIS handlers, U.S. intelligence can pick up on the communication and interaction. And by going abroad to fight for a jihadist group, an individual is committing a crime and can be arrested. Lone wolves, by definition, lack such links. The San Bernardino attackers were not on law enforcement’s radar screen before striking. And given permissive U.S. gun laws, even someone like Mateen who allegedly abused his spouse and was repeatedly investigated by the FBI, could legally purchase an automatic weapon because he had not yet openly supported a terrorist group. The FBI is already aggressive against potential terrorists to the point that civil liberties groups criticize it for entrapment and otherwise using stings too aggressively.\n\nBecause even a struggling ISIS retains its appeal and at least some of its supporters will stay off the radar screen, lone wolf attacks are likely to continue. In addition to continuing aggressive law enforcement efforts, the best thing U.S. leaders could do is to promote a sense of resilience and avoid demonizing Muslim Americans, recognizing that even as we mourn the tragic deaths of so many of our countrymen we must ensure that someone like Mateen is portrayed as hateful and pathetic, not as a representative of a broader threat among American Muslims or part of some grandiose ISIS plot.', 'title': 'Omar Mateen, lone-wolf terrorist', 'url': 'https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2016/06/13/omar-mateen-lone-wolf-terrorist/', 'keywords': ['terrorists', 'mateen', 'lonewolf', 'syria', 'lone', 'group', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'omar', 'attack', 'isis', 'supporters'], 'tags': {'U.S. Politics & Government', 'Education', 'Global Development', 'International Affairs', 'Cities & Regions', 'Defense & Security', 'U.S. Economy', 'Terrorism & Extremism', 'National Security', 'Islamist Movements', 'Arms Control'}, 'summary': 'Editors’ Note: Even though shooter Omar Mateen apparently pledged allegiance to ISIS in a last-minute 911 call, the assault is far from a classic ISIS strike, writes Dan Byman.\nInitial reports indicate that Mateen is a lone wolf, inspired by a terrorist group’s ideology but not under its operational control.\nBecause lone wolves operate on their own, their personal agendas often mix with those of the terrorist group they claim to serve.\nInitial reports suggest Mateen was homophobic: his father claimed that Mateen became upset when he saw two men kissing.\nAnd given permissive U.S. gun laws, even someone like Mateen who allegedly abused his spouse and was repeatedly investigated by the FBI, could legally purchase an automatic weapon because he had not yet openly supported a terrorist group.', 'date': 1465776000}]
