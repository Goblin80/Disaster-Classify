[{'text': 'A young married couple accused of killing 14 people at an office party in San Bernardino, California, bore little resemblance to the young men typically accused of involvement in terrorist activities.\n\nThe couple, who are accused of killing 14 people at an office holiday party in San Bernardino, California, kept a low profile on social media. They had a 6-month-old infant and a steady income. Those who knew them said they didn’t talk about jihad or radical Islam, even as they were amassing an arsenal of pipe bombs and assault weapons.\n\nThe husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, was a 28-year-old American citizen of Pakistani descent who was born in the United States. His wife, Tashfeen Malik, who is believed to be in her late 20s, was a Pakistani national who lived in Saudi Arabia for more than 20 years.\n\nThey bore little resemblance to the aimless young men who have been arrested in the United States in the past for plotting violent attacks.\n\nBoth Farook and Malik died in a shootout with police hours after Wednesday\'s attack at the Inland Regional Center social services agency in San Bernardino, about 60 miles (100 km) east of Los Angeles.\n\n‘Very nice person’\n\nWith a new baby, a steady job as a health inspector and a large extended family, Farook showed little outward signs of the social isolation and violent rhetoric that the National Counterterrorism Center says can make individuals susceptible to extremist ideology.\n\nAn attorney for Farook’s family said he was an isolated individual who had few friends, but the family had no idea that he was planning an attack.\n\nFarook was born in Chicago to Pakistani immigrants and raised in southern California. In a profile on an Indian matrimonial site, Imilap.com, a user identified as “farooksyed49” described himself as a 22-year-old Muslim living in Riverside and working as a county health inspector, the LA Times reported.\n\n“Enjoy working on vintage and modern cars, read religious books, enjoy eating out sometimes travel, and just hang out in back yard doing target practice with younger sister and friends,” the profile read.\n\nThe mosque director of the Islamic Center of Riverside, Mustapha Kuko, described Farook – who had worshipped at the mosque until about two years ago – as quiet, private and devoted to Koran study, the paper said.\n\nAt the San Bernardino mosque Dar-Al-Uloom Al-Islamiyah of America, where Farook also worshipped, another congregant who gave his name as Ali described Farook to the LA Times as “a very nice person, very soft”.\n\nAli said Farook had memorised the Koran, a rare accomplishment for even devout Muslims.\n\n‘Just a housewife’\n\nThe couple met online a few years ago and married last year in Islam’s holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia. Malik entered the United States on a fiancée visa in 2014.\n\nThe LA Times reported that the couple held a celebration at the Islamic Center of Riverside for those who could not attend the Mecca ceremony. Colleagues from the public health department where Farook worked as an inspector threw the couple a baby shower. An online baby registry in Malik’s name listed a large box of Pampers, Johnson’s safety swabs, a car seat and baby wash, the paper said.\n\nThe FBI has acknowledged that it knows little about Tashfeen Malik. Those who attended the mosque with Farook also said they knew nearly nothing about his wife. Even Farook\'s mother, who lived with the couple and their daughter, was unaware of many aspects of their private lives, according to attorneys for Farook\'s family.\n\nThe lawyers described Malik on Friday as "just a housewife" who was quiet like her husband and strictly followed Muslim custom. She wore traditional clothing that covered her face so that her brothers-in-law didn\'t even know what she looked like, according to the lawyers who now represent Farook\'s mother and his three siblings.\n\nAuthorities say she ditched the Muslim garb for a combat-style outfit Wednesday for the attack.\n\nUnlike many members of the Millennial generation, Farook and Malik left few digital footprints on the social-media outlets that have prompted many other FBI investigations. The couple doesn’t appear to have been on any sort of terrorism watch list, government officials have told Reuters.\n\nFBI officials said on Friday that Malik pledged allegiance to Islamic State group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in an online post shortly before she and Farook stormed the party on Wednesday. Facebook said it had taken down a page set up by Malik under an alias and is cooperating with investigators.\n\n(FRANCE 24 with AP, REUTERS)\n\nDate created : 2015-12-05', 'title': 'Portrait: the young couple behind a shooting rampage in California', 'url': 'https://www.france24.com/en/20151205-portraits-california-farook-malik-shooters-bernardino', 'keywords': ['shooting', 'described', 'little', 'rampage', 'farooks', 'bernardino', 'farook', 'mosque', 'malik', 'center', 'california', 'young', 'portrait', 'couple', 'san'], 'tags': {'Read more', 'Press', 'Shootings in San Bernardino', 'weapons', 'terrorism', 'California'}, 'summary': 'A young married couple accused of killing 14 people at an office party in San Bernardino, California, bore little resemblance to the young men typically accused of involvement in terrorist activities.\nThe couple, who are accused of killing 14 people at an office holiday party in San Bernardino, California, kept a low profile on social media.\nColleagues from the public health department where Farook worked as an inspector threw the couple a baby shower.\nThe lawyers described Malik on Friday as "just a housewife" who was quiet like her husband and strictly followed Muslim custom.\nThe couple doesn’t appear to have been on any sort of terrorism watch list, government officials have told Reuters.', 'date': 1449273600}, {'text': 'Unfortunately, our website is currently unavailable in most European countries.

Hours later, they died in a shootout with police.\n\nAuthorities were trying to determine a motive, which could include workplace violence or terrorism.\n\nWednesday\'s shooting happened at a social services center for the disabled where the suspect\'s colleagues with the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health were renting space for a celebration. It was the nation\'s deadliest mass shooting since the attack at a school in Newtown, Connecticut, three years ago that left 26 children and adults dead.\n\nSan Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan identified one dead suspect as Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, the other as Tashfeen Malik, 27, his wife or fiancee. Burguan said Farook was born in the United States; the chief said he did not know Malik\'s background.\n\nThe attackers invaded the Inland Regional Center about 60 miles east of Los Angeles around 11 a.m., opening fire in a conference area where county health officials were having an employee banquet, said Marybeth Feild, president and CEO of the nonprofit center.\n\n"They came prepared to do what they did, as if they were on a mission," Burguan said.\n\nFarook attended the event before leaving — and returning to kill.\n\nCo-worker Patrick Baccari said he was sitting at the same table as Farook, who suddenly disappeared, leaving his coat on his chair. Baccari said when the shooting started, he sought refuge in a bathroom and suffered minor wounds from shrapnel slicing through the wall.\n\nBaccari described Farook as reserved and said he showed no signs of unusual behavior. Earlier this year he traveled to Saudi Arabia and returned with a wife, later growing a beard, Baccari said.\n\nThe FBI is investigating several possible motives, including workplace violence and terrorism, according to David Bowdich, assistant director of the bureau\'s Los Angeles office. He did not elaborate.\n\nFarook was a restaurant inspector for the health department, according to public records. Police chief Burguan said he had been a county employee for five years.\n\nThe couple dropped off their 6-month-old daughter with relatives Wednesday morning, saying they had a doctor\'s appointment, Hussam Ayloush, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said after talking with family. Farhan Khan, who is married to Farook\'s sister, told reporters he last spoke to his brother-in-law about a week ago. He said he was in shock, condemned the violence, and had "absolutely no idea why he would do this."\n\nAbout four hours after the morning carnage, police hunting for the killers riddled a black SUV with gunfire in a shootout 2 miles from the social services center in this Southern California city of 214,000 people. Farook and Malik were found with assault rifles and semi-automatic handguns, and were wearing "assault-style clothing" with ammunition attached, authorities said.\n\nTelevision news helicopters captured the aftermath, as officers slowly approached the mangled SUV.\n\nIn the morning, as the day\'s first bursts of gunfire echoed through the large three-building complex, some people locked themselves in offices, desperately waiting for police and texting or making hushed phone calls to loved ones.\n\n"People shot. In the office waiting for cops. Pray for us. I am locked in an office," Terry Petit\'s daughter, who works at the center, texted him.\n\nPetit choked back tears as he read his daughter\'s words for reporters outside the center, where social workers find jobs, housing and transportation and provide other services to people with disabilities such as autism, cerebral palsy and epilepsy.\n\nOlivia Navarro said her daughter, Jamile Navarro, a case manager at the social service center, called her and whispered that she was hiding in a locked room.\n\n"I said, \'All right, I\'ll be there, turn off the lights, don\'t make a sound,\'" Navarro said. "And that was it."\n\nHer daughter survived.\n\nThat the violence happened at a place dedicated to helping people with developmental disabilities — even if they were not targeted — made it even harder for some to comprehend.\n\n"These are all disabled kids, very disabled," said Sherry Esquerra, who was searching for her daughter and son-in-law, both of whom work at the center. "She gets all the services she possibly could for these kids. So I just don\'t understand why somebody would come in and start shooting."\n\nAccording to its web page, the center has a client base of more than 30,000 people and their families. It is a privately run nonprofit, the largest of its kind in California with about 670 employees.\n\nFBI agents and other law enforcement authorities converged on the center and searched room to room for the attackers. Triage units were set up outside, and people were wheeled away on stretchers.\n\nSeventeen people were wounded, according to authorities. Ten were hospitalized in critical condition, and three were in serious condition, Fire Chief Tom Hannemann said.\n\nOthers were marched from the building, hands raised so police could search them and make sure the attackers weren\'t trying to slip out.\n\nThey had indeed escaped. One witness, Glenn Willwerth, who runs a business across the street, said he heard 10 to 15 shots and then saw an SUV with tinted windows pull out "very calmly, very slowly" and drive off.\n\nAs the manhunt dragged on, stores, office buildings and schools were locked down in the city, and roads blocked off.\n\nWith police looking for a dark SUV, officers staking out a home in the nearby city of Redlands saw a vehicle matching that description. Public records show the home is a possible residence of a family member of Farook.\n\nAuthorities pursued the SUV, and a gunbattle erupted around 3 p.m. One officer among nearly two dozen involved in the shootout suffered a minor injury.\n\nA fake bomb — a metal pipe stuffed with cloth — was thrown from the SUV during the chase, said Agent Meredith Davis of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\n\nThree explosive devices — thought to be real and all connected to one another — were found at the social service center and later detonated by a bomb squad, police said.\n\nA third person who was spotted running near the gunbattle was detained, but Burguan said it was unclear if that person had anything to do with the crime. At a late-night news conference, Burguan also said that early witness accounts of three shooters were probably wrong: "We are reasonably confident at this point that we have two shooters and we have two dead suspects."\n\nPresident Barack Obama urged the country to take steps to reduce mass shootings, including stricter gun laws and stronger background checks.\n\n"The one thing we do know is that we have a pattern now of mass shootings in this country that has no parallel anywhere else in the world," Obama told CBS.\n\nThe social services center has two large buildings that require a badge to get in, said Sheela Stark, a member of its board of trustees. However, the conference room that hosts public events such as Wednesday\'s banquet is usually left open when visitors are expected.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Brian Melley, John Antczak, Christopher Weber, John Rogers, Christine Armario and Sue Manning in Los Angeles; Amy Taxin in Redlands; Eric Tucker and Tami Abdollah in Washington; Gillian Flaccus in Anaheim, Alina Hartounian in Phoenix; Michael Sisak in Philadelphia; and Hannah Cushman in Chicago contributed to this story.

Fourteen people are dead, numerous others wounded and two suspects – a young Muslim couple – were shot and killed by police. Terrorism has not been ruled out. Neither has the possibility that the male suspect was a disgruntled employee.\n\nOnce again, President Barack Obama appeared on television to offer condolences and press for stricter gun laws. Obama also pointed out that these incidents are unique to America. “We have a pat\xadtern now of mass shoot\xadings in this coun\xadtry that has no par\xadal\xadlel any\xadwhere else in the world.”\n\nOn Guns, We’re Not Even Trying\n\nNicolas Kristof – The New York Times\n\nAstonishingly, it’s perfectly legal even for people on the terrorism watch list to buy guns in the United States. More than 2,000 terrorism suspects did indeed purchase guns in the United States between 2004 and 2014, according to the Government Accountability Office and The Washington Post’s Wonkblog. Democrats have repeatedly proposed closing that loophole, but the National Rifle Association and its Republican allies have blocked those efforts, so it’s still legal….\n\nRonald Reagan, hailed by Republicans in every other context, favored gun regulations, including mandatory waiting periods for purchases. “Every year, an average of 9,200 Americans are murdered by handguns,” Reagan wrote in a New York Times op-ed in 1991 backing gun restrictions. “This level of violence must be stopped.”\n\nObama’s statement on San Bernardino:\n\nMass Shootings and Gun Control\n\nJohn R. Lott Jr. – The National Review\n\nThe American background-check system is supposed to prevent the purchase of a gun by anyone who has been convicted of a felony or certain misdemeanors. The Feinstein amendment would also ban the sale of guns to anyone who is on the terrorist watch list. Now, being on the watch list sure sounds bad, but it doesn’t mean that a person has been convicted of anything…. You can be on it simply because the FBI wants to interview you about someone you might know…. As of 2014, about 50,000 people were on the no-fly list. This is a ten-fold increase since Obama became president. Between February 2004 and December 2014, over 2,000 people on the watch list bought one or more guns. The government has not identified a single one of these people as using a gun in a crime…. Putting people on a list and prohibiting them from legally purchasing guns doesn’t really stop them from getting weapons. The fact that people are prohibited from buying certain drugs doesn’t mean people can’t get them. It’s the same with guns.\n\nObama’s Resigned Anger After San Bernardino\n\nDavid A. Graham – The National Journal\n\nObama con\xadveys a sense of des\xadpair. He is a man who has pushed hard for stricter gun laws. Des\xadpite over\xadwhelm\xading pub\xadlic sup\xadport for some of the meas\xadures he has pro\xadposed, he has achieved noth\xading le\xadgis\xadlat\xadively… The reas\xadons for those fail\xadures are com\xadplic\xadated, ran\xadging from his own broken trust with con\xadser\xadvat\xadives to the polit\xadic\xadal power of the Na\xadtion\xadal Rifle As\xadso\xadci\xadation…. “Each time this hap\xadpens I am go\xading to say that we can ac\xadtu\xadally do something about it, but we’re go\xading to have to change our laws,” he said after Umpqua. “And this is not something I can do by my\xadself.

It has been reported that they had two “assault rifles“. From ktla.com:\n\n“After they were killed in a shootout, two suspects in Wednesday’s mass shooting in San Bernardino were found to have been carrying AR-15 assault rifles, pistols and many magazines of ammunition, ATF Agent Meredith Davis said.”\n\nThe New York Times and other outlets repeated the misinformation that was put out by the ATF. In Agent Davis' defense, she did say “commonly referred to as” before she said “assault rifles”. The rifles are not “assault rifles“, which is a technical term, though they may be “assault weapons” a legal term defined under California law, which varies from state to state.\n\nThe rifles had been illegally altered to accept detachable magazines, and the terrorists had possession of numerous standard capacity magazines, instead of the reduced capacity magazines mandated by California law. One of the rifles was manufactured by DPMS and the other was a Smith & Wesson M&P 15. It has been reported that there was an attempt to convert the M&P 15 to full auto fire.\n\nBoth rifles were equipped with reflex optical sights, iron backup sights, vertical foregrips, slings, and retractable stocks.\n\nFrom wsj.com:\n\n“Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, the suspects in the Wednesday shooting that left 14 people dead and 21 wounded, were armed with four guns. They carried two .223-caliber semiautomatic weapons and two 9mm semiautomatic pistols, according to San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan.”\n\nThe two semiautomatic rifles were versions of the popular AR-15 model, according to San Bernardino officials. One was made by DPMS Inc., and the other by Smith & Wesson.\n\nEarly reports had claimed that one of the pistols was made by Smith & Wesson, but that was later corrected to Springfield Armory. The other pistol was made by Llama. Both pistols were chambered in the popular 9×19 cartridge, commonly known as the 9mm Luger.\n\nThe Llama is one of their 1911 type clones. Note that the bottom of the slide is machined straight all the way to the muzzle.\n\nThe pistols have been said to have been legally purchased by Syed Farook in California four years ago.

A Facebook official said Malik praised Islamic State in a post at 11 a.m. Wednesday, when the couple were believed to have stormed a San Bernardino social service center and opened fire.\n\nMalik and her husband, Syed Farook, died several hours after the massacre in a fierce gunbattle with police.\n\nThe IS-affiliated news service Aamaq called Malik and Farook “supporters” of their Islamist cause but stopped short of claiming responsibility for the attack.\n\nFBI Director James Comey would not discuss whether anyone affiliated with the Islamic State communicated back to Malik, but he said there was no indication yet that the plot was directed by ISIS or any other foreign terror group. He also declined to rule out that possibility based on further investigation.\n\n“The investigation so far has developed indications of radicalization by the killers and of potential inspiration by foreign terrorist organizations,” Comey said. He cautioned that the investigation has not yet shown evidence the couple was part of a larger group.\n\nDespite mounting signs of the couple’s radicalization, there “is a lot of evidence that doesn’t quite make sense,” Comey said in a nod to the fact that the investigation was just two days old.\n\nAttorneys for Farook’s family cautioned the public against rushing to judgment about terrorist connections to the attack.\n\nMohammad Abuershaid and David Chesley, who represent Syed Farook’s family, said there’s no proof linking the shooters to a broader terrorist organization and most of the evidence focuses on Facebook posts made under an alias by Farook’s wife, Malik.\n\nBoth attorneys say he was married to a soft-spoken housewife who only spoke with female relatives.\n\nWhen asked to explain possible motivations for the attack, Chesley said at a news conference Friday that co-workers made fun of Farook for his beard and said he was isolated with few friends.\n\nThey say Farook’s mother lived with the couple but she stayed upstairs and didn’t notice they had stockpiled 12 pipe bombs and well over 4,500 rounds of ammunition.\n\nAbuershaid and Chesley say the couple left their 6-month-old daughter in her care when they carried out Wednesday’s attack.\n\nThey say the child is with child protective services.

He said investigators were looking carefully to determine if there is an IS connection.\n\nAttorneys representing Farook’s family said Friday that none of his family members had any indication either Farook or his wife held extremist views. They urged the public and media to wait for specific evidence before jumping to conclusions.\n\nFarook and Malik rented a townhome where investigators said they found an arsenal of ammunition and homemade bombs. On Friday morning, the property’s owner allowed reporters inside.\n\nBowdich said the FBI was done with the scene and that analysts were trying to retrieve data from two cellphones found near there that had been crushed in an apparent attempt to destroy the information inside.\n\n“We hope that will take us to their motivation,” he said.\n\nUntil Friday, federal and local law enforcement officials said terrorism was a possibility but that the violence could have stemmed from a workplace grudge or a combination of motives.\n\nFarook had no criminal record and neither he nor his wife was under scrutiny by local or federal law enforcement before the attack, authorities said.\n\nMalik, 27, was a Pakistani who grew up in Saudi Arabia and came to the U.S. in 2014 on a fiance visa. Farook, a 28-year-old restaurant health inspector for the county, was born in Chicago to Pakistani parents and raised in Southern California.\n\nLaw enforcement officials have long warned that Americans acting in sympathy with Islamic extremists — though not on direct orders — could launch an attack inside the U.S. Using slick propaganda, the Islamic State in particular has urged sympathizers worldwide to commit violence in their countries.\n\nOthers have done so. In May, just before he attacked a gathering in Texas of people drawing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad, a Phoenix man tweeted his hope that Allah would view him as a holy warrior.\n\nTwo weeks ago, with Americans on edge over the Islamic State attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead, Comey said that U.S. authorities had no specific or credible intelligence pointing to an attack on American soil.\n\nSince March 2014, 71 people have been charged in the U.S. in connection with supporting ISIS, including 56 this year, according to a recent report from the George Washington University Program on Extremism. Though most are men, “women are taking an increasingly prominent role in the jihadist world,” the report said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether Malik exhibited any support for radical Islamists before she arrived in the U.S. — or, like scores of others arrested by the FBI, became radicalized through online or in-person associations after arriving.\n\nFriends of the soft-spoken Farook who knew him from his daily prayers at a mosque in San Bernardino said they saw nothing to make them think he was violent. They said Farook reported meeting his future wife online.\n\nTo receive her visa, Malik was subjected to a vetting process the U.S. government describes as vigorous. It includes in-person interviews, fingerprints, checks against terrorist watch lists and reviews of her family members, travel history and places where she lived and worked.\n\nForeigners applying from countries that are home to Islamic extremists — such as Pakistan — undergo additional scrutiny before the State Department and Homeland Security approve their applications.\n\nPakistani intelligence officials said Malik moved as a child with her family to Saudi Arabia 25 years ago.\n\nThe two officials, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said that the family is originally from a town in Punjab province and that the father initially moved to Saudi Arabia around three decades ago for work.\n\nAnother person close to the Saudi government said Tashfeed Malik did not stay in Saudi Arabia, eventually returning to Pakistan and living in the capital Islamabad, though she returned to Saudi Arabia for visits. The person was not authorized to speak publicly, and did so on condition of anonymity.\n\nFriends in Southern California said they had no idea Farook and Malik were building pipe bombs and stockpiling thousands of rounds of ammunition for their commando-style assault on a gathering of Farook’s colleagues from San Bernardino County’s health department.\n\nOn Friday morning, the owner of the townhome that Farook and Malik rented opened it to reporters.

The attack saw at least 14 people killed and 21 injured, police said on Thursday.\n\n“There was obviously a mission here. We know that. We do not know why.”\n\nA married couple, Farook and Malik were each of Pakistani descent. Farook was a U.S. citizen and Malik was not, though she was in America on a K-1 Visa. Malik obtained the K-1 Visa — which allows the fiancé or fiancée of a United States citizen to temporarily enter the country — in July 2014, after Farook travelled internationally to meet her, police said. The two had a six-month-old daughter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFarook and Malik were killed on Wednesday, not during their own attack but during a bloody shootout with police. During that shootout and their attack, they wore tactical-style body armor and were equipped with multiple guns, all of which were obtained legally, according to San Bernardino police.\n\nPolice chief Jarrod Burguan said the couple also had an enormous amount of ammunition and 12 crude pipe bombs in their home, including “hundreds of tools” that could have been used to construct more bombs. The couple also allegedly placed a pipe bomb at the Inland Regional Center, but the remote control they built to set it off did not work correctly and the device did not detonate.\n\n“There was obviously a mission here. We know that,” FBI Los Angeles Assistant Director David Bowdich told reporters on Thursday. “We do not know why.”\n\nAs far as trying to figure out a motive, much of the attention so far has been placed on Farook, an American citizen born in Chicago, Illinois.\n\n“He never struck me as a fanatic, he never struck me as suspicious.”\n\nFor the last five years, the “tall, thin young man with a full beard” had been working as an environmental inspector for the San Bernardino County Public Health Department, where he inspected restaurants, among other things. Records from the county’s Department of Public Health show hundreds of inspection reports conducted by Farook over the years. The New York Times reported that he made about $70,000 a year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTogether, Farook and Malik appeared to be “living the American Dream,” a co-worker told the L.A. Times. They had met online, and had just had a baby.\n\nAs of Thursday, a few of Farook’s online dating profiles were still intact, giving a glimpse into his personal affiliations. He was a Sunni Muslim, according to one profile, and considered his family “religios [sic] but modern,” according to another. His interests included “read[ing] religios [sic] books” and “just hang[ing] out in back yard doing target pratice [sic] with younger sister and friends.”\n\nFarook’s estranged father, also named Syed, told the Daily News that his son was a “very religious,” but was shocked at suggestions that religion may have been a motivating factor in the attack. Co-workers also told the L.A. Times that Farook had recently traveled to Saudi Arabia, though they expressed similar disbelief that religious extremism drove him to kill.\n\n“He never struck me as a fanatic, he never struck me as suspicious,” Griselda Reisinger, a former co-worker, told the L.A.

In particular, investigators are struggling to understand why, with many pieces of evidence pointing toward radical Islamism, Farook and Malik chose the target they did. They attacked Farook’s employee holiday party—a choice with the hallmarks of a workplace shooting. (Bowdich wondered aloud during Thursday’s press conference whether the couple were planning an attack and then decided for some reason to target the gathering.) The specificity of the legal definition may also explain explain Obama’s reticence during a statement Thursday morning, when he said: “It is possible that this was terrorist-related, but we don’t know.”\n\nBut the disconnect between the strict legal definition of terrorism and what the general public sees as terrorism creates some difficulty. In the case of an attack like September 11, it’s an easy call. Beyond that, things get muddy. Throw in academic definitions and the matter gets even muddier. “It’s just kind of hard empirically to get at what we mean by terrorism—violence that’s symbolic, violence that’s meant to communicate, to send a message—how, just objectively, do you distinguish that from any other sort of violence?” Martha Crenshaw told my colleague Kathy Gilsinan in September.\n\nAfter major acts of violence, there’s often a chorus that insists that the terror label be quickly applied, but the makeup of that chorus is often very different.\n\n“We are deeply concerned that this is yet another manifestation of terrorism—radical Islamic terrorism here at home,” Senator Ted Cruz told the Republican Jewish Coalition Thursday morning, where the GOP presidential candidates were speaking. “Coming on the wake of the terror attack in Paris, this horrific murder underscores that we are at a time of war, whether or not the current administration realizes it or is willing to acknowledge it.” Others also took Obama to task for not invoking the T-word in cases involving alleged or proven Islamist ties.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, progressives have been eager to apply the label of terrorism to non-Muslim violence. There were calls to label Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood shooter Robert Dear and other abortion-clinic attackers as terrorists. (Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee notably agreed, calling the shooting “domestic terrorism.”) Other writers have made the case that police violence against people of color fits the definition of terrorism, because it is violence aimed at affecting the behavior of a group of people.\n\nIt’s easy to say that the FBI’s definition doesn’t matter, that it’s just a matter of semantics, but that ignores the very reasons that people outside of justice system demand the label. Once something is a officially deemed an act of terror, it holds greater meaning. It changes an event from senseless violence to part of a larger landscape.

(AP) — The deadly shooting in San Bernardino happened in a state with some of the nation’s toughest gun laws: California bars assault weapons, blocks the sale of large-capacity magazines and requires universal background checks for all gun purchases.\n\nAuthorities say they believe suspected gunman Syed Rizwan Farook and wife Tashfeen Malik had legally obtained two handguns and that two rifles were also legally purchased in California. Federal officials say the attackers had large-capacity magazines that violate California law in their SUV.\n\nSince the attack Wednesday at a social service center in Southern California, the state’s strict laws and the apparent legal purchase of the weapons have set off a debate over the effectiveness of gun measures and whether getting tougher would help prevent more violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n‘‘Strong gun laws do prevent gun deaths. Not every law can prevent every gun death,’’ said Allison Anderman, a staff attorney with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence in San Francisco. ‘‘They work most of the time.’’\n\nGet Ground Game in your inbox: Daily updates and analysis on national politics from James Pindell.

Louisiana’s gun laws were ranked 50th and it is No. 2 in deaths, according to the group’s 2014 rankings.\n\nGun laws vary dramatically state-to-state, even city-to-city. The patchwork of regulations means it’s often easy for determined gunmen to acquire weapons by skirting laws in their home state, they say. Untraceable weapons can be built from scratch using parts bought online.\n\nAs a result, gun control advocates in the days since the shooting have called for more stringent laws in California and nationwide. At least two state lawmakers say they will propose measures to close what they consider loopholes in the state’s gun laws.\n\nCrime Prevention Research Center president John Lott, a critic of additional gun laws who is often cited by the gun lobby, argued that the shooting illustrates how expanded background checks supported by President Barack Obama do not stop mass public shootings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe noted that California, Colorado and Oregon — sites of the three most recent shootings — already have such laws in place.\n\n‘‘We’re being told that even though these laws didn’t stop these attacks in these states, somehow they would work in the rest of the country,’’ he said. ‘‘I know the claim is, ‘we don’t expect it to do everything but it will do some.’ Maybe they could point to one case where these laws would make a difference.’’\n\nThe FBI said Farook legally bought the two handguns used in the attack — purchases that would have required a background check. And there is no indication he or Malik had any criminal record or history of mental illness that would have triggered California’s unique law allowing authorities to seize weapons from those who aren’t allowed to own them.\n\nFederal officials are investigating whether the military-style rifles used were part of an illegal straw purchase, possibly from a former neighbor of Farook, and then given to Farook or Malik.\n\nCalifornia limited access to high-powered, military-style rifles in 1989 and lawmakers passed further restrictions in 2000, when the state banned specific types of AR-15 and AK-47 style rifles. It also bans the sale of ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 bullets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLegislation that would have banned so-called bullet buttons, which allow shooters to rapidly exchange empty magazines for ones fully loaded with bullets, stalled in the state Legislature two years ago.\n\nDavid Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, said it is foolish to draw policy conclusions based on the facts of one specific shooting when the U.S. has more than 30,000 gun deaths per year.\n\nHe questioned whether the assault-style rifles used in San Bernardino should be legal anywhere.\n\n‘‘Are those guns needed for self-defense? Are they needed for hunting? They can kill a lot of people, which they succeeded in doing,’’ he said.\n\nEven in California, advocates for stricter gun control say there are holes in the law. The impression that the state has strict gun laws is ‘‘based on fact, but in some cases it’s inaccurate,’’ said Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat.\n\nNewsom has proposed a ballot initiative that would require on-the-spot background checks when buying ammunition, ban the possession, not just the sale, of large-capacity magazines with 10 rounds or more and require police reports when guns are lost or stolen.\n\nThose measures might not address the specific circumstances of what happened in San Bernardino, he acknowledged. But, he said, ‘‘that doesn’t mean they’re not appropriate proposals to address the next circumstance and the next moment.’’\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Ryan J.

Neighbors say authorities with guns drawn broke windows and used a cutting torch to get into the garage. A neighbor says an old friend of Farook\'s is the person that lives in the house.\n\nA law enforcement official says that more than three years ago, that person bought two assault rifles used in the shooting, but authorities haven\'t been able to talk to him because he checked himself into a mental hospital after the attack.

Batool said the two families were not on speaking terms.\n\n"Tashfreen Malik\'s parents are rich and we are poor and they don\'t like to meet with their poor relatives," she said.\n\nThe Islamic State group\'s official radio station has aired a statement saying the shooting was carried out by two "supporters" of the extremist group.\n\nWhile praising the attack, the group stopped short of claiming responsibility for it. The Al-Bayan report Saturday echoed a claim carried Friday by the IS-affiliated Aamaq news agency.\n\nThe radio report did not refer to Farook and Malik as actual members of the Islamic State group. Militants affiliated with IS who carry out attacks are commonly referred to in the group\'s propaganda as "lions," \'\'fighters" or "mujahedeen."\n\n\n\nOn Friday, David Bowdich, assistant director of the FBI\'s Los Angeles office, said, "We are now investigating these horrific acts as acts of terrorism."\n\nHe also said the shooters attempted to destroy evidence, including crushing two cell phones and discarding them in a trash can.

Malik was a Pakistani woman who came to the U.S. in 2014 on a fiancee visa before Farook married her in California.\n\nSpecifics details about her postings were not disclosed by the law enforcement official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because this person was not allowed to discuss an ongoing investigation.\n\nNBC News quotes an official close to the investigation as saying that Malik posted a statement of support for Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on Facebook, "just before the attack."\n\nMeanwhile, reporters gained access to the suspects\' home Friday getting glimpses of the lives on the suspects before the shootings.

It was the nation\'s deadliest mass shooting since the attack at a school in Newtown, Connecticut, three years ago that left 26 children and adults dead.\n\nSan Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan identified one dead suspect as Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, the other as Tashfeen Malik, 27, his wife or fiancee. Burguan said Farook was born in the United States; the chief said he did not know Malik\'s background.\n\nThe attackers invaded the Inland Regional Center about 60 miles east of Los Angeles around 11 a.m., opening fire in a conference area where county health officials were having an employee banquet, said Marybeth Feild, president and CEO of the nonprofit center.\n\n"They came prepared to do what they did, as if they were on a mission," Burguan said.\n\nFarook attended the event before leaving — and returning to kill.\n\nCo-worker Patrick Baccari said he was sitting at the same table as Farook, who suddenly disappeared, leaving his coat on his chair. Baccari said when the shooting started, he sought refuge in a bathroom and suffered minor wounds from shrapnel slicing through the wall.\n\nBaccari described Farook as reserved and said he showed no signs of unusual behavior. Earlier this year he traveled to Saudi Arabia and returned with a wife, later growing a beard, Baccari said.\n\nThe FBI is investigating several possible motives, including workplace violence and terrorism, according to David Bowdich, assistant director of the bureau\'s Los Angeles office. He did not elaborate.\n\nFarook was a restaurant inspector for the health department, according to public records. Police chief Burguan said he had been a county employee for five years.\n\nThe couple dropped off their 6-month-old daughter with relatives Wednesday morning, saying they had a doctor\'s appointment, Hussam Ayloush, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said after talking with family. Farhan Khan, who is married to Farook\'s sister, told reporters he last spoke to his brother-in-law about a week ago. He said he was in shock, condemned the violence, and had "absolutely no idea why he would do this."\n\nAbout four hours after the morning carnage, police hunting for the killers riddled a black SUV with gunfire in a shootout 2 miles from the social services center in this Southern California city of 214,000 people. Farook and Malik were found with assault rifles and semi-automatic handguns, and were wearing "assault-style clothing" with ammunition attached, authorities said.\n\nTelevision news helicopters captured the aftermath, as officers slowly approached the mangled SUV.\n\nIn the morning, as the day\'s first bursts of gunfire echoed through the large three-building complex, some people locked themselves in offices, desperately waiting for police and texting or making hushed phone calls to loved ones.\n\n"People shot. In the office waiting for cops. Pray for us. I am locked in an office," Terry Petit\'s daughter, who works at the center, texted him.\n\nPetit choked back tears as he read his daughter\'s words for reporters outside the center, where social workers find jobs, housing and transportation and provide other services to people with disabilities such as autism, cerebral palsy and epilepsy.\n\nOlivia Navarro said her daughter, Jamile Navarro, a case manager at the social service center, called her and whispered that she was hiding in a locked room.\n\n"I said, \'All right, I\'ll be there, turn off the lights, don\'t make a sound,\'" Navarro said. "And that was it."\n\nHer daughter survived.\n\nThat the violence happened at a place dedicated to helping people with developmental disabilities — even if they were not targeted — made it even harder for some to comprehend.\n\n"These are all disabled kids, very disabled," said Sherry Esquerra, who was searching for her daughter and son-in-law, both of whom work at the center. "She gets all the services she possibly could for these kids. So I just don\'t understand why somebody would come in and start shooting."\n\nAccording to its web page, the center has a client base of more than 30,000 people and their families. It is a privately run nonprofit, the largest of its kind in California with about 670 employees.\n\nFBI agents and other law enforcement authorities converged on the center and searched room to room for the attackers. Triage units were set up outside, and people were wheeled away on stretchers.\n\nSeventeen people were wounded, according to authorities. Ten were hospitalized in critical condition, and three were in serious condition, Fire Chief Tom Hannemann said.\n\nOthers were marched from the building, hands raised so police could search them and make sure the attackers weren\'t trying to slip out.\n\nThey had indeed escaped. One witness, Glenn Willwerth, who runs a business across the street, said he heard 10 to 15 shots and then saw an SUV with tinted windows pull out "very calmly, very slowly" and drive off.\n\nAs the manhunt dragged on, stores, office buildings and schools were locked down in the city, and roads blocked off.\n\nWith police looking for a dark SUV, officers staking out a home in the nearby city of Redlands saw a vehicle matching that description. Public records show the home is a possible residence of a family member of Farook.\n\nAuthorities pursued the SUV, and a gunbattle erupted around 3 p.m. One officer among nearly two dozen involved in the shootout suffered a minor injury.\n\nA fake bomb — a metal pipe stuffed with cloth — was thrown from the SUV during the chase, said Agent Meredith Davis of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\n\nThree explosive devices — thought to be real and all connected to one another — were found at the social service center and later detonated by a bomb squad, police said.\n\nA third person who was spotted running near the gunbattle was detained, but Burguan said it was unclear if that person had anything to do with the crime. At a late-night news conference, Burguan also said that early witness accounts of three shooters were probably wrong: "We are reasonably confident at this point that we have two shooters and we have two dead suspects."\n\nPresident Barack Obama urged the country to take steps to reduce mass shootings, including stricter gun laws and stronger background checks.\n\n"The one thing we do know is that we have a pattern now of mass shootings in this country that has no parallel anywhere else in the world," Obama told CBS.\n\nFederal authorities said that the two assault rifles and two handguns used in the violence were purchased legally, but they haven\'t said how and when they got into the hands of the two shooters.\n\nThe social services center has two large buildings that require a badge to get in, said Sheela Stark, a member of its board of trustees.

By the time law enforcement arrived at the Inland Regional Services, the assailants were believed to have escaped in what Burguan described as a dark sports utility vehicle.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, law enforcement officials said two of the suspects are dead; one is a man, and the other is a woman. They have been identified as Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, a former county health worker born in the United States, and Tashfeen Malik, 27, a woman described as his Pakistani-born wife.\n\nThe motive behind the attack is still not clear, but Burguan called it an act of “domestic terrorism.” He said the men carried long guns but did not provide any details. He also said the shooters were “dressed and equipped in way to indicate they were prepared.”\n\n“They came prepared to do what they did, as if they were on a mission,” he said. “They came in with a purpose.”\n\nSan Bernardino Sheriff John McMahon said government and county buildings are locked down, and extra safety precautions have been taken as nearby schools. The FBI and the ATF are also on the scene.\n\nDetails on the incident remain sketchy. Earlier Wednesday, San Bernardino Police Department spokeswoman Sgt. Vicki Cervantes described as many as three heavily-armed shooters who may have been wearing body armor.\n\nAmbulance crews could be seen on local California TV news broadcasts treating wounded people.\n\nThe shootings come just days after abortion opponent Robert Lewis Dear allegedly killed three people at a Planned Parenthood facility in Colorado last Friday. It also follows the Nov. 13 terror attacks in Paris that killed 130. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the Paris rampage, but Burguan said there is no evidence so far that foreign-motivated extremist groups are involved in the onslaught in San Bernardino.\n\nSpeaking to CBS News, President Barack Obama beseeched Americans to do more to prevent the kind of mass shootings that have become all too common over the last decade. Wednesday’s attack appears to be the deadliest mass shooting since 2012, when Adam Peter Lanza killed 26 at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Conn. Lanza also killed his mother before fatally shooting himself.\n\n“We have a pattern now of mass shootings in this country that has no parallel anywhere else in the world,” the president said. “And there’s some steps we could take, not to eliminate every one of these mass shootings, but to improve the odds that they don’t happen as frequently.”\n\nThis story has been updated repeatedly to reflect breaking news.\n\nPhoto Credit: Frederick J.

We’re all concerned,” he said.\n\nIt was the deadliest U.S. mass shooting since the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre three years ago.

But the increasing number of women drawn to Islamic State is worrisome to American law enforcement and making it almost impossible to flag the prototypical recruit for investigation.\n\n“The challenge of our efforts to try and find and redirect people is that it is a wide spectrum of folks,” FBI Director James Comey said Friday. “It isn’t a particular demographic or geography. It’s about people seeking meaning in their lives in a misguided way.”\n\nIn the U.S., men by far account for the largest percentage of supporters of the Islamic State group. But authorities are concerned that the number of women supporting extremist ideology is on the rise.\n\nBefore the most recent attacks, the Anti-Defamation League had identified 15 women linked to Islamic extremist activity in 2014 and 2015 — a higher total than in the entire prior decade. A recent George Washington University report on Islamic State found that one-third of the nearly 300 Twitter accounts of U.S.-based sympathizers monitored during a six-month period appeared to be operated by women.\n\nMost recruits had tried to join Islamic State on its home turf, including three teenage girls from Colorado who were intercepted in Germany last year and a 19-year-old Mississippi woman who the FBI says set off with her love interest before being stopped at a regional airport. Others are accused of planning violence: In New York, two women were charged in April with plotting to build a bomb for an attack.\n\n“Unlike in the Middle East or even Europe, it is indeed rare for a woman to be involved in such a shooting in the U.S.,” said Oren Segal, director of the ADL’s Center on Extremism. He said Islamic State “has made it a priority to reach and recruit women, so perhaps we are starting to see the results of those efforts.”\n\nThere’s no single answer for why the group has succeeded in attracting women, but law enforcement officials cite propaganda directed at that population. Even as Islamic State spotlights decapitations of captives, recruitment videos that show smiling children paint a family-friendly portrait and suggest a role for women who join the self-described caliphate in Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe goal is to entice women to become brides for the jihadi fighters and help expand the group’s regional dominance.\n\nIslamic State “likes to say it’s not a terrorist group, but it’s really a state or a movement,” said Max Abrahms, a terrorism expert at Northeastern University.\n\nThe FBI is investigating the shootings in San Bernardino as an act of terrorism. Comey said agents have found signs of radicalization, though no indication that the couple were part of a larger cell or network.\n\nAt the center of the investigation is Malik, born in Pakistan and described by family lawyers as a quiet and devout Muslim who moved to the U.S. in July 2014 and married a month later.\n\nA U.S. official says she used a Facebook alias to praise the Islamic State in a post around the time she and her husband, Syed Farook, opened fire. The official was not authorized to discuss the case publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nEven the most sophisticated electronic surveillance tools can fail to pick up a plot by a couple who spend hours communicating face to face in the privacy of their home.\n\n“Usually when terrorist plots are broken up, it’s by intercepting communications among members.

On Thursday, one day after the shootings, we learned the names of all 14 victims.\n\nOne of those killed was Nicholas Thalasinos, 52, a man who recently renewed his wedding vows with his wife, Jennifer. Just two weeks ago, Nicholas, who identified himself as a Messianic Jew, was having a heated on-the-job discussion about the nature of Islam with Syed Rizwan Farook, his fellow restaurant inspector and one of the shooters. At the time, co-workers who heard some of the discussion did not sense violence.\n\nOf the injured, 10 were hospitalized in critical condition, and three were in serious condition. Others had been treated and released.\n\n28, 27\n\nThese are the ages of the suspected shooters who are both now dead. The suspects, Syed Farook, 28, and Tashfeen Malik, 27, were wearing assault-style clothing when they entered the southern-most building of the Inland Regional Center.\n\nThey carried out the attack after dropping off their six-month-old daughter at a family member\'s house but their motive remains unknown.

The reports started coming it at 11 a.m. Pacific time, so it’s still very early. Here’s what KTLA says:\n\nSan Bernardino Fire Department units were responding to a report of a “20-victim shooting” on Wednesday, authorities said. The incident was reported in the 1300 block of South Waterman Avenue, the Fire Department tweeted shortly before 11:15 a.m. San Bernardino police confirmed around 11:30 a.m. there was an active shooter in the area of Orange Show Road / Waterman Avenue near Park Center Circle. The San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department warned people to avoid the area due to police activity.\n\nUpdated: Officials say there may be as many as three shooters. The targeted building appears to be the Inland Regional Center, which provides services to people with developmental disabilities.\n\nUpdate: A representative for the San Bernardino Police Department has said that there are fatalities, but the number has not yet been released.\n\nUpdate: Here\'s how the L.A. Times describes the current situation:\n\nThe shooters, wearing camouflage and masks, left up to 20 people injured and several dead after gunfire erupted around 11 a.m., sources and police officials said. A person who was inside the building also told the Los Angeles Times that the shooting may have happened during a Christmas party, but declined to be identified or comment further. Investigators are now searching for a black sport utility vehicle that may have fled from the Waterman Avenue office building, according to federal law enforcement sources, who requested anonymity because the investigation is active and ongoing.\n\nThere still appear to be no arrests an as a result there are all sorts of speculative reports of sightings and confrontations elsewhere. A press conference has been scheduled around 1:45 p.m. Pacific time.\n\nUpdate: At a press conference, San Bernardino\'s police chief said "upwards of 14" people have been killed and the same amount injured. They believe there were up to three shooters that are still at large. They do not yet know the motives for the shooting. They do not yet know whether it was an act of terrorism.\n\nUpdate (3:20 p.m. Pacific): Police are currently in a confrontation on the streets of San Bernardino. It appears, according to KTLA\'s chopper coverage, that somebody has been shot and is bleeding on the street.\n\nFrom the AP about the latest confrontation:\n\nPolice say shots have been fired and a suspect is down near a dark-colored SUV. It\'s unclear if the suspect is related to the deadly shooting Wednesday at a social services facility in Southern California. Police have said that the suspects may have fled in a dark SUV. San Bernardino police Sgt. Vicki Cervantes said she knew of no officers who were injured in the shootout. Television footage showed armored vehicles blocking the SUV on a residential street.\n\nTelevision coverage showed a dark SUV that was riddled with bulletholes. At a press conference, a police official upped then number of people injured at the shooting to 17.\n\nUpdate (4:10 p.m. Pacific): Police have confirmed one suspect down and one in custody but very little else. One police officer was injured but is in good condition. There will be a bigger press conference at 4:45 p.m. with more information.\n\nPolice are stil active in apparently two other locations, though it\'s not clear if there are actually any suspects there related to the shooting.\n\nUpdate (5:45 p.m. Pacific): San Bernardino Police and FBI officials held another press conference. The latest information:\n\nThe shootout with police and suspects happened when they were following a lead in nearby Redlands. Two people were killed in the scene. One was male. One was female. They were carrying both "assault" weapons and handguns. They have provided no other information about the two suspects.\n\nThey have a third person in custody that was seen fleeing the above situation. They do not know for certain whether this person is a suspect or actually connected to the shooting.\n\nThe police do not have a motive as yet. There has been a theory passed through anonymous police sources to the Los Angeles Times that somebody left the center after a confrontation at a meeting and came back, armed, with friends. Police acknolwedged that somebody did indeed leave the building after a dispute of some sort, but they don\'t know if that person is one of the suspects.\n\nThey found what the believe to be is an explosive device at Center, and they\'re still working with it. A report that the suspects threw some form of pipe bomb at the police turned out to be incorrect. They are approaching both the home of the suspects and the SUV very carefully out of concern for additional explosives.\n\nThey don\'t know for certain whether there were any additional people responsible for the shooting.\n\nUpdate (6:50 p.m. Pacific): Multiple law enforcement sources have confirmed to the Los Angeles Times the name of the male suspect killed by police. His name is apparently Syed Farook. They investigate:\n\nTwo law enforcement sources identified one of the deceased suspects as Syed Farook, an American citizen.

Let\'s go straight to my "Nightline" coanchor Byron Pitts in San Bernardino again for us tonight. Reporter: Good evening from California. Tonight the nation grappling with what officials now say may be the deadliest terror attack on our homeland since 9/11. Authorities saying a young mother who arrived here on a fiancee Visa may have radicalized her husband. Pledging allegiance to the leader of Isis as the couple turned a holiday party into a killing field. Tonight investigators trying to determine how the warning signs of their double life went undetected. This is the first picture of tashfeen malik whose killing spree with her husband ended in this glaze of gunfire. The young mother herself allegedly firing out the back window of this SUV at police. Today authorities say they are investigating the shoot-out in San Bernardino as an act of terror. This is now a federal terrorism investigation led by the FBI. Reporter: Authorities say within moments of murdering 14 people at her husband\'s holiday office party, tashfeen malik went on Facebook to declare her allegiance to Isis. Yes, there was a pledge of allegiance. Reporter: Malik was born in Pakistan, moved to Saudi Arabia at age 4. She returned to Pakistan to attend college. Her marriage to Syed farook came after she wed him on a matrimonial website and had an engagement party in Mecca, saud yeah Arabia. A dress ABC news discovered today does not exist. U.s. Officials are questioning whether she was the one who radicalized her husband. I don\'t know the answer whether she influenced him or not. Being a husband myself, we\'re all influenced to an extent. But I don\'t know the answer. They were great parents. Always happy with each other. Reporter: Today Syed farook\'s sister and brother-in-law paint a far different picture. She never mentioned any political thing. Not to us ever, or to anybody else that we know. Reporter: Until Wednesday\'s massacre the couple seemed to live unassuming lives. A two-bedroom townhouse where they lived with farook\'s mother. Behind this door evidence of their double life. As my colleague Matt Gutman saw. Holes punched through the doors, a door that\'s been ripped in half right next to this bathroom. Reporter: In the kitchen, cookware on the counter. A bottle of Pepto next to cans of baby food. Dishes in the sink. Overnight the FBI had turned their home back to its owner who allowed reporters into his rental property. The FBI had already removed all the evidence they needed. A list on a coffee table of items seized. Christmas lights, dozens of boxes of ammunition. Upstairs in the baby\'s room, diapers, open suitcases, a bin with shredded paper, a prayer rug. In the closet shirts, gun cleaner, pairs of baby shoes. The baby is now in the care of child protective services. The house shows little evidence the deadly attacks they had allegedly planned at the inland regional center. That attack began Wednesday at 11:00 A.M. When the couple reportedly entered through a patio door, unloading at least 65 rounds. We have several down in the conference room. Reporter: The death toll could have been much higher in part because the workers were just re-entering the conference room after a break when the shooting started. She was sitting with her friends. Talking, the break almost finished. Reporter: As she was about to re-enter conference room from the bathroom the world changed. At that time, bullets started flying. Reporter: She was shot four times. So it\'s two bullets hit straight above her head to the wall. Then she saw her hand bleeding, right hand. And the bleeding happening here. Some minor bleeding happening -- She was hit on her arm? On the right arm. And right here. One right here. And one here. In her stomach? Reporter: The killing focused just where she had been sitting moments before. People screaming and pop pop pop sounds, multiple gunshots. And if she left 30 seconds prior when the restroom, she felt she could have been sitting there and got killed. Because all the people she was sitting with, they are killed. All dead. Reporter: Anisa and her husband are Muslim and worship at the same mosque farook attended 2012 to 2014. Today disbelief mixed with prayer. I know him very well. Reporter: Mustapha is director of the mosque. He told us farook came faithfully, twice daily, sought his counsel about his future bride. He was not looking for, say, beauty, money, fame, name, whatever. He\'s looking for a religious woman. Someone who has -- A Muslim woman of strong faith? Exactly. Reporter: She kept her face covered even among family members who say they never saw her face. They did not interact with her. The brothers did not ever see her face. They\'ve never seen her face because she did wear a burqa. They knew her but she was totally covered. Reporter: Trends and quaint ants say Syed farook was a cloneclone loner, quiet, kept to himself. Not someone who looks for confront advertise or getting into disputes. In talking to some of his coworkers they describe a SHAR person. Very nice but very reserved, very quiet. Right. Here at the mosque the same way? Same way. Quiet, reserved, stay today himself? Same way, that\'s true. That\'s true. Staying to himself, very much to himself, you know. Probably the I\'m the only one who used to talk to him before anybody else. Reporter: Today before Friday prayers he says he doesn\'t recognize the man who murdered 14 people. It\'s a very different person from the person who did this crime. Very different person. Reporter: We talked about suicide bombings, we talked about things that tarnished the image of Islam, and he thought it was wrong. That\'s what I\'m saying. Reporter: Muslims across the nation and in San Bernardino itself strongly condemning the couple\'s actions. The taking of lives of innocent people is absolutely unacceptable. Reporter: And his family apologizing tonight for the man who caused so much pain. I just want to say that we\'re sorry for their loss. We can\'t begin to imagine what they\'re going through. Somebody lost their husband, wife -- it\'s just a horrible feeling. And we are extremely sad. Byron Pitts reporting from San Bernardino.

They did not report if he was killed or in custody.\n\nEarlier in the day, three shooters reportedly gained entry to a Christmas party at the county’s Inland Regional Center, a non-profit serving people with disabilities, and used assault rifles to slaughter the attendees. Seventeen other people were injured and taken to nearby hospitals.\n\nSan Bernardino police and FBI officials said they are looking at several motives, but would not confirm any theory other than saying there had been an argument at the party before the shooting began.\n\n“Somebody did leave, but I have no idea if that was the person who came back,” said San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan.\n\nFor hours, the shooting and police chase paralyzed a working class city of 200,000 that lies 60 miles east of Los Angeles. As the evening unfolded, it was clear that local, state and federal police were actively investigating a range of crime scene sites.\n\nThere were several focal points of the shooting spree and ensuing police chase: the Inland Regional Center; a house in the nearby city of Redlands where police found the getaway black SUV; and the San Bernardino neighborhood where a gun battle erupted killing the two suspected killers.\n\nSome were being carefully combed for explosive devices, following reports that the shooters had pipe bombs. Late Wednesday night, a search warrant was being served by a SWAT team in a condominium complex that had been evacuated, local media reported.\n\nOne police officer was injured in the gunfight with the suspects in the SUV, Burguan said, however the injuries were not life-threatening. Reports from at least one trauma center said two shooting victims were in critical but stable condition. Another local hospital said other victims were in critical condition and most of those hospitalized there were women.\n\nThe San Bernardino incident was the second mass shooting Wednesday—four people were killed in a Savannah, Georgia incident—and the 355th such event in 2015. A mass shooting is defined by law enforcement as involving four or more victims.\n\nThe San Bernardino shooting occurred at about 11am PST, when the shooters burst into a conference room that had been rented by a health care provider for its annual awards and Christmas party, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nThe shooters escaped in a dark SUV, prompting a manhunt that unfolded for hours and was televised live. Entire neighborhoods were told to shelter in place and dozens of public schools were locked down until late afternoon.\n\nIn the early evening press conference, San Bernardino’s police chief said they received tips that led the police to a house in nearby Redlands, where the SUV was spotted and then followed back to a San Bernardino street about two miles from the Inland Regional Center.\n\nA gun battle ensued when police confronted the SUV, leaving the two suspected killers dead. In addition to the military-style assault rifles, handguns were also found inside the vehicle. A third person was seen fleeing the scene and taken into police custody, but Burguan would not say if that person was the third reported shooter or a bystander trying to flee a gun battle. One officer was shot in that confrontation.\n\nLocal police were working with the FBI and other federal authorities to investigate the shooting, motives and possible accomplices. The FBI officer in charge was repeatedly asked if this was a terrorist attack, which he would neither confirm nor deny.\n\n“They were dressed and equipped,” Burguan said, referring to the shooters and their tactics. He would not identify the likely assailants or the makes or models of their weapons. He said the dead man and woman in the getaway SUV were “dressed in dark tactical gear; that’s the best way I can put it.”\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore details are emerging in the unfolding police chase in San Bernadino County, CA, where 14 people have died and another 17 have been injured during a shooting by what is believed to be three suspects at a social services center at 11am PST.\n\nThere are media reports based on law enforcement sources that one of the shooters reportedly attended the event at a county office complex where a health care provider rented a ballroom and then returned with the other assailants armed with rifles and wearing body armor.\n\nWithin the last hour the SUV that was used as a getaway was stopped by police, where a shootout ensued. One officer was shot, a local police spokeswoman said, saying one is believed to be dead and another possibly on the ground. A separate chase is unfolding in a neighborhood 2 miles from the attack. Just before 5 PM a second SWAT team descended on another home in the nearby town of Redlands.\n\nOther reports about the shooting follow. According to the Guardian:\n\nIn a residential area two miles east of the site of the shooting, at least three SWAT vehicles have surrounded a black SUV where one suspect is believed to have been killed. According to NBC Bay Area news, which is broadcasting live pictures via helicopter, a second suspect is reported to be lying in the street. One officer is also believed to have been injured, but police say he is OK.\n\nThe photograph below shows the police confrontation with the reported suspects.\n\nThe police department’s SWAT team was training nearby and was suited, “ready to roll” and responded rapidly, said Lt. Richard Lawhead, according to KTLA. The city of San Bernardino\'s Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said at a hastily organized press conference that the attackers "came prepared to do what they did, as if they were on a mission.”\n\nThe Los Angeles Times has reported that a bomb squad detonated an apparent explosive device left at the scene.\n\nWATCH: More news updates below via live KTLA video feed:\n\nFrom CNN:\n\nWitnesses told police they saw three men with long rifles, a law enforcement source told CNN. The source said the suspects got into a black SUV and drove away.\n\nThe bomb squad found a suspicious package on the second floor of a building and determined it is "not normal," the source said. They are going to handle it with a robot, the source added.\n\n• There are multiple buildings in the complex, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. SWAT teams are moving methodically through to clear them. • The FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were responding, agency representatives said.\n\nFrom the Guardian:\n\nPolice have moved reporters away from the Center but continue to close in on the building, with tactical teams and explosives technicians going room to room in the search for civilians and suspects.\n\n***\n\nSan Bernardino police believe the suspect or suspects are well armed and possibly wearing body armor, a spokesperson has told the LA Times, in line with accounts heard by local reporters.\n\nSergeant Vicky Cervantes told reporters that officers are going door to door. “It’s a very active scene,” she said. “It’s very fluid.”\n\nAraksya Karapetyan of the local Fox affiliate has heard similar accounts.\n\nLocal ABC7 has spoken with a man whose wife was in the center when the shooting began, and who managed to escape the building.\n\n“They locked themselves in her office. They seen bodies on the floor,” Aguilera said, adding that his wife saw ambulances taking people out of the building on stretchers.\n\n***', 'title': 'San Bernardino Shooting: Male and Female Suspected Killers Dead After Shootout With Police', 'url': 'https://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/breaking-20-reported-shot-mass-shooting-san-bernardino-california', 'keywords': ['shooting', 'told', 'shootout', 'bernardino', 'reported', 'male', 'shooters', 'local', 'nearby', 'female', 'suv', 'center', 'dead', 'suspected', 'san', 'killers'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'San Bernardino Shooting: Male and Female Suspected Killers Dead After Shootout With PolicePhoto Credit: Shutterstock.comUPDATE:The worst mass shooting since 2013’s Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting unfolded in the California working class city of San Bernandino, where 14 people attending a Christmas party at a county building serving the region’s disabled were gunned down by three reported assailants with assault rifles.\nSan Bernardino police and FBI officials said they are looking at several motives, but would not confirm any theory other than saying there had been an argument at the party before the shooting began.\n“Somebody did leave, but I have no idea if that was the person who came back,” said San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan.\nThe San Bernardino incident was the second mass shooting Wednesday—four people were killed in a Savannah, Georgia incident—and the 355th such event in 2015.\nA gun battle ensued when police confronted the SUV, leaving the two suspected killers dead.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'Day Three: As authorities continue their investigation, it is clear beyond any reasonable doubt that the San Bernardino attack was an act of radical Islamic terror. Many Democrats and much of the media are still treating it as a “gun violence” incident, and are using the attack as an effort to push gun control laws–and to demonize those who view the event, and the consequences, differently. As San Bernardino mourns, the members of the San Bernardino Police Department are emerging as heroes for solving the crime quickly, and preventing the further attacks that the terrorists clearly had planned.\n\n4:50 p.m.: However, the question of an Islamic caliphate didn’t get so much distance:\n\n4:49 p.m.: Raheem Kassam corners the mosque’s representatives on death sentences for ex-Muslim apostates.\n\n4:26 p.m.: The leaders of the San Bernardino mosque that played host to terrorist shooter Syed Farook refused to answer as to whether the FBI is investigating other mosque attendees, repeatedly stating “no comment.”\n\n3:59 p.m.: Glass ceiling. Video by Raheem Kassam:\n\n3:02 p.m.: Tashfeen Malik:\n\nMalik, who was born in Pakistan, moved to Saudi Arabia 25 years ago when she was about four years old. When she was older, she likely moved back and forth between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, according to a source close to the Saudi Arabian government. In 2007, she returned to Pakistan to study at Bahuddin Zakri University in Multan and stayed until 2012, according to a Pakistani intelligence official. She was said to be a brilliant student and was not known to have religious or political affiliation while there. … Malik came to the U.S. on what is known as a “fiancé” visa, which allows an American fiancé to petition for his or her partner’s temporary entry before marriage. For the visa application, the address she listed in her Pakistani hometown, ABC News discovered today, does not exist. Malik received a her Green Card this summer, U.S. officials said.\n\n1:24 p.m.: Raheem Kassam’s video report on the journalists at the apartment:\n\n12:15 p.m.: CNN analyst Harry Houck has reiterated his earlier shock that the media were allowed to rummage through the apartment. He tells Brooke Baldwin: “I can’t believe the FBI can make a mistake like this. I really don’t.”\n\n11:35 a.m.: Breitbart News’ Michelle Moons and Raheem Kassam are on the scene, investigating whether journalists actually had permission to storm the apartment. The FBI seems not to care. Local police are not yet commenting. Permission was, at best, unclear. Moons and Kassam found the crowbar that was used to force open the entrance to the apartment.\n\n11:30 a.m.: The FBI has announced that the San Bernardino killings are officially an act of terrorism. It has also confirmed that Malik posted a pledge of allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to Facebook as the attack was being carried out.\n\n10:20 a.m.: The Council on American-Islamic Relations is blaming the United States for the radical Islamist terror attack in San Bernardino. Apparently, U.S. policies cause Muslims to snap.\n\nBreitbart News’ Jordan Schachtel reports:\n\nThe United States is “partially” responsible for a jihadi massacre on Wednesday in San Bernardino, California, carried out by Islamic State loyalists who killed 14 and wounding dozens more, Hussam Ayloush, the Los Angeles Director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), said Friday… “When we support coup leaders in Egypt or other places, when we supports dictatorship, oppressive regimes around the world that push people over on the edge, then they become extremists, then they become terrorists. We are partly responsible,” he added.\n\nThis is almost like issuing demands on behalf of a terrorist organization. Change policies, or else.\n\n10:15 a.m.: The media continue rummaging around in the apartment, getting their fingerprints on everything, moving objects around. And–who knows? planting evidence. It appears the media did not have clearance from local police to do what they are doing right now.\n\nBreitbart News’ John Nolte has more.\n\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff’s spokesperson Deputy Olivia Bozek tells Grasswire apartment is still a crime scene, was not cleared. — Matthew Keys (@MatthewKeysLive) December 4, 2015\n\n3.

Amazingly, they are now rummaging around in their personal belongings, holding up ID cars and stuffed animals (and Qurans) for the cameras. Somehow law enforcement did not protect the premises and has not taken custody of evidence that could be extremely important for intelligence about future terror attacks or criminal investigations.\n\n@HowardKurtz they used a crowbar to get in pic.twitter.com/PlN9ywyUzz — Greg Pollowitz (@GPollowitz) December 4, 2015\n\nTwo Korans among the IDs on the bed. pic.twitter.com/liPtzXSJbf — John Nolte (@NolteNC) December 4, 2015\n\n8:10 a.m.: Tashfeen Malik, the female attacker, pledged allegiance to ISIS on social media, CNN and the New York Times both report. From the Times:\n\nWASHINGTON — The woman who helped carry out the shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., on Wednesday had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in a Facebook posting, according to federal law enforcement officials. There’s no evidence the group directed the woman, Tashfeen Malik, and her husband Syed Rizwan Farook, to launch the attacks, which killed 14 and wounded 21, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing. “At this point we believe they were more self-radicalized and inspired by the group than actually told to do the shooting,” one of the officials said. The posting had been removed from the social media site and it’s not clear when federal authorities obtained it.\n\nOn Wednesday, the day of the attack, President Barack Obama assured Americans that there was no threat from ISIS. The interview aired Thursday, after evidence of terrorist links had long since emerged–and while Obama continued to insist “workplace violence” was a possible explanation. 5:20 a.m.: New details of the 14 dead are emerging, and there are some heartbreaking ironies, as well as stories of heroism and courage. For example, Bennetta Betbadal, 46, was a Catholic who fled Islamic extremism in Iran, only to be killed by an Islamic extremist in the United States. Her family has set up a GoFundMe page. While Governor Jerry Brown has struck a statesmanlike tone throughout, Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA) is vowing not to stand for moments of silence, following the left’s line that thoughts and prayers are not enough, and only conformity with the gun control agenda will suffice as an acceptable reaction to events. Meanwhile, Syed Rizwan Farook’s sister Saira Khan has expressed her sense of shock to CBS News: “I can never imagine my brother or my sister-in-law doing something like this. Especially because they were happily married, they had a beautiful 6-month-old daughter. It’s just mind boggling why they would do something like this.” A colleague endorses the idea that Farook was radicalized by his wife, and not the other way around:\n\nChristian Nwadike was shocked when he learned the man accused of gunning down over a dozen people turned out to be the coworker he sat only feet from for nearly four years. He said Farook was different after he returned from Saudi Arabia. “Do you believe that he was radicalized?” Begnaud asked him. “Yes, by the wife, I think he married a terrorist,” Nwadike said. “He married a terrorist?” “Yes, he was set up through that marriage,” Nwadike responded.\n\nDay Two: Authorities are still investigating details of a mass shooting Wednesday morning in San Bernardino, California at the Inland Regional Center, a facility for developmentally disabled adults. 14 people were killed and at least 17 injured in a conference room at the center, where county employees had been enjoying a holiday party. There appear to be two suspects, both Muslim, a husband-and-wife team named Syed Rezwan Farook, 28, and Tashfeen Malik, 27. Large portions of the city remain locked down. 9:25 p.m.: The community has held a vigil for the victims at San Manuel Stadium. It has been an incredibly difficult 36 hours, and lives will never be the same–neither in San Bernardino, nor perhaps in the country itself. We leave with the shock of knowing that a quiet neighbor could be a deadly terrorist. We mourn a political debate that sought every enemy–even prayer–before facing the reality of evil. But we will remember the heroism of those who arrived to help, and those who helped each other.\n\n6:40 p.m.: Catherine Herridge of Fox News reports that the use of pipe bombs strapped to premote-controlled cars is an Al Qaeda “signature” design that is “borrowed by ISIS,” and which has been propagated globally the Islamist magazine Inspire. 6:30 p.m.: Mia Bloom of Georgia State University floats the theory on Fox News’ Kelly File that Malik may have radicalized her husband, rather than the other way around. No one has yet published an image of Malik–except the aerial shot of her dead body.\n\n6:15 p.m.: As reminder of how bizarre this story is, and of the sheer diversity of views and lifestyles in the Muslim community: the lead terrorist’s brother is a Navy veteran decorated for his service in the Global War on Terror, the Daily Mail reports. 6:05 p.m.: Lt. Madden is asked to respond to public criticism of the police–i.e. #BlackLivesMatter. “You know, we’ve taken a lot of hits lately. Some justified, some of it unjustified…There are cops who go astray. But overwhelmingly, the vast majority of officers…do the job to protect the public.” 5:55 p.m.: Lt. Mike Madden of the San Bernardino Police Department, one of the first to arrive on the scene, describes his experience on Wednesday. His voice trembling, he describes the “unspeakable” scene; the panic on the faces of people so terrified they did not want to follow the police out; the “moans and the wails” along with fire alarms; the fresh smell of gunpowder in the air, suggesting more shooters present; the surreal job for which he had trained but for which no one, he says, can be prepared.\n\nFirst responder cop: “It was unspeakable, the carnage that we were seeing” #sanbernardino — Raheem Kassam (@RaheemKassam) December 4, 2015\n\nCop: “When we entered there was fresh gunpowder and the smell of gunpowder in the air” #sanbernardino — Raheem Kassam (@RaheemKassam) December 4, 2015\n\nCop: “I noticed upon entry there was a Christmas Tree in [the room]” #sanbernardino. — Raheem Kassam (@RaheemKassam) December 4, 2015\n\nCop: “there are so many families going into this holiday season that are now going to have to deal with this tragedy” #sanbernardino — Raheem Kassam (@RaheemKassam) December 4, 2015\n\nIn any age, the performance of the San Bernardino authorities would have been heroic. In an age of constant criticism of the police, it is something more than that–a kind of restoration, for the nation as a whole, of the ideals of service and leadership. 5:50 p.m.: Gov. Jerry Brown addresses a press conference in San Bernadino with law enforcement officials. “This is a really sad day,” he says. His remarks are focused on public safety and vigilance.\n\nGov Gerry Brown: “We have to be on our guard” #SanBernardino pic.twitter.com/kTtBzX5Y0w — Raheem Kassam (@RaheemKassam) December 4, 2015\n\n5:45 p.m.: The New York Times notes that Farook and Malik both shared a Pakistani background, though he was born in Illinois and raised in California. They led quiet lifestyles and apparently fooled their own relatives thoroughly about their intentions.\n\n5:40 p.m.: Farook’s apparent online dating pitch, via Breitbart News’ Neil Munro, emphasized his simple, pious lifestyle:\n\nAssalaamu Alaikum, I was born and raised in the US (mostly in California). I have a pretty simply lifestyle. I spend much of my free time in the masjid. memorizing the quran and learning more about the religion. In my free time, I will work on my project car or workout. I don’t really watch much TV or movies. I really don’t know what else to write.so feel free to ask about all the things that I left out…. I am looking for a practicing muslimah. someone who takes her religion very seriously and is always trying to improve her religion and encouraging others to do the same using hikmah and not harshness. In sha-Allah if her imaan is in the right place then the other small things should not pose that much of a problem.\n\n4:00 p.m.: Los Angeles-area news source KTLA has posted a moving tribute to some of the victims of the San Bernadino shooting, based on information compiled from news articles, social media, and tips from the public. Visit the memorial post here.\n\n3:30 p.m.: Farook had dating profiles at online marriage services, including a website called dubaimatrimonial.com, the Washington Post reports:\n\nSyed Rizwan Farook was looking for a wife. On at least two online sites, he posted details for prospective brides. “Religious but modern,” he apparently wrote on one. He made a point of noting his American citizenship on another…. On another matchmaker site, Dubaimatrimonial.com, a person believed to be Farook described himself as having family roots in Karachi, noting he was born in Chicago and was residing in Los Angeles as an American citizen.\n\n3:15 p.m.: Hillary Clinton has finally come around to admitting that the shooting is likely a terrorist attack:\n\nHillary Clinton, in New Hampshire, on #SanBernardino shooting: “It’s becoming clearer that we’re dealing with an act of terrorism.” — Liz Kreutz (@ABCLiz) December 3, 2015\n\n2:00 p.m.: At least one of the wounded victims in the attack is a Muslim woman who attends a mosque Farook used to attend. The Los Angeles Times reports:\n\nOne of the victims in the shooting also was a member of the congregation. She is a social worker based in the same center as Farook. She suffered multiple gunshot wounds during the attack, but is recovering and is not in critical condition, [Mustafa] Kuko [director of the Islamic Center of Riverside] said.\n\n1:50 p.m.: The photograph news agencies are now using of Farook is the following:\n\n1:45 p.m.: Another victim was Daniel Kaufman, 42, who is survived by his boyfriend, Ryan Reyes, 32. The Los Angeles Times reports:\n\nThe last message from Kaufman arrived at 10:37 a.m. — a picture of a friend he had met at a comic book conference. About an hour later, Reyes received a text from his sister: “Hey Ry does Daniel work at the Regional Center in Sb? Check the news.” Reyes, 32, called his boyfriend repeatedly but kept getting sent to voicemail. “Call me ASAP!” he texted. There was no reply.\n\nThe next 22 hours were a slow torture, as Reyes and his family received conflicting reports about his boyfriend’s fate. 1:17 p.m.: The first victim to be identified is Nicholas Thalasinos, a middle-aged man. He is apparently a Messianic Jew, i.e. a man identifying as a Jew but believing in Jesus Christ. His Facebook profile identifies him as a supporter of Israel and a fan of Rush Limbaugh.\n\nA New York Post profile reports that Thalasinos had anti-Muslim views:\n\nOne of the victims of the San Bernardino massacre was a Messianic Jew who filled his Facebook page with condemnations of Muslims and impassioned screeds against jihadist terror… Under “Education,” Thalasinos listed on Facebook, “Studied Conservatism at Limbaugh Institute of Advanced Conservative Studies.”\n\nIt is inevitable that journalists will begin to ask whether those views–and Limbaugh–triggered Farook to undertake his rampage against fellow county employees. 12:25 p.m.:\n\n12:00 p.m.: Breitbart London Editor-in-Chief Raheem Kassam is in San Bernadino and says that police investigators have set up special cameras to map the scene of the final showdown:\n\nPolice now deploying what one officer called “fancy cameras” which are little white orbs that 3D map the whole street. They are on small tripods and are being placed 10-15ft away from each other up the street.\n\n11:41 a.m.: Democrats continue to make gun control the focus of their response to the terror attack in San Bernadino. The White House is calling for a new assault weapons ban, Charlie Spiering notes. Presidential contender Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is calling for “universal background checks,” Patrick Howley reports. And Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is even claiming that there is a “terrorist loophole” in gun laws that Republicans won’t close, as Caroline May reports. But as AWR Hawkins notes, California already has these regulations in place, and could not prevent the shooting.\n\nCalifornia has expanded background checks, which means they require a background check on every sale–retail or private. These are the very checks that President Obama, Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), and Democrat surrogates like Gabby Giffords, Mark Kelly, Shannon Watts, and others are pushing at the federal level on the false premise of keeping Americans safe. They are the same checks that Colorado enacted after the heinous December 2012 attack on Sandy Hook Elementary, under the illusion that such checks would prevent a high profile public attack.\n\n11:35 a.m.: On Sep. 11, 2001, Democrats and Republicans stood together on the Capitol steps and sang “God Bless America.” We don’t deal with national emergencies the same way anymore. As Breitbart News’ National Security team points out, the two parties continue to interpret events very differently, 24 hours after the San Bernardino attacks–even as the so-called Islamic State threatens New York and Moscow with future terror attacks. Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson told the Republican Jewish Coalition presidential candidate forum Wednesday that the U.S. faced a “class of civilizations” at home and abroad:\n\nHe discussed his recent trip to Syrian refugee camps, advocating for the creation of “safe havens” in the Middle East, but not for the refugees’ import to the United States. Secondly, “we are currently facing a clash of civilizations” between radical Islam and western values, he said, explaining that Israel is America’s ally in this coming battle.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats are calling for gun control and accusing Republicans of bigotry. Three U.S. Representatives are heading to a D.C.-area mosque where al Qaeda’s Anwar al-Awlaki once preached, to show solidarity in the face of alleged “Islamophobia”:\n\nDemocratic Representatives Rep. Donald Beyer (D-VA), Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN), and Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-NY) announced in a letter: “We must show that we will not tolerate islamophobia and that those who propagate it do not represent the melting-pot America that we celebrate.”\n\n11:22 a.m.: The San Bernardino Police Officers Association has posted a message on the Facebook page of the San Bernardino City Fire Department:\n\nIn the aftermath of what was arguably the worst day, during the darkest period of our community we witnessed the men and women of the SBPD rise to a level few communities (fortunately) have personally witnessed. The professionalism, dedication, compassion and training gelled when it was needed and the horror was confined and put down. I am very proud to be a member of this organization and to work closely with so many brave men and women.\n\nRead it in full here. 11:05 a.m.: The New York Times reports that the FBI has designated this case as terrorism:\n\nThe F.B.I. is treating its inquiry into the massacre here as a counter-terrorism investigation, two law enforcement officials said Thursday, based on materials the suspects stockpiled — including explosives — their Middle East travels and evidence that one of them had been in touch with people with Islamist extremist views, both in the United States and abroad.\n\n10:35 a.m.: The New York Post confirms reporting by CNN that Farook is thought to have communicated with people who are the subject of independent terror investigations. Breitbart News’ John Hayward reports that police found a dozen pipe bombs at the suspect’s apartment. 10:25 a.m.: CBS News reports that the suspects had looked at ISIS propaganda online.\n\nJUST IN: #SanBernardino suspects were looking at ISIS propaganda online, source tells CBS News https://t.co/VCykxixRWA — CBS News (@CBSNews) December 3, 2015\n\nIt was just eight days ago that President Barack Obama reassured the nation that there was no imminent threat of terror attacks from ISIS.\n\n10:22 a.m.: The San Bernardino police chief praised the heroism of his officers, who led terrified survivors out of the building and were able to track and stop the killers before they could strike again. The police also cooperated with the local FBI branch, which was called in to help dispose of booby traps at the Redlands home of one of the subjects. In a somewhat humorous twist, the man whom police chased Wednesday evening turned out not to be a terrorist, but was booked anyway on a misdemeanor warrant.\n\n10:15 a.m.: At the press conference, the FBI says it is not yet ready to conclude that the attacks were international terrorism. However, officials confirmed that Farook had traveled abroad extensively in 2014, including Pakistan. Malik had entered the country on a K-1 visa, which is a nonimmigrant visa for people engaged to U.S. citizens, and traveled on a Pakistani passport.\n\n9:55 a.m.: At a press conference in San Bernardino, police rule appear to rule out workplace violence as a motive. They confirm that the guns were purchased legally, though only the handguns were purchased by Farook. The vehicle used was rented through yesterday, and therefore had Utah license plates. Law enforcement will release the names of the victims throughout the day.\n\n9:50 a.m.: NBC News is reporting that the suspects left a remote-controlled bomb on the scene of the holiday party, similar to that used by the Tsarnaev brothers in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. The aim was to kill police and medical personnel. The devices apparently malfunctioned.\n\nThe attackers who killed 14 at a California office party Wednesday left behind a remote-controlled explosive device as they raced away in a black SUV with the bomb controller in their hands, NBC News has learned. Multiple federal and regional sources familiar with the investigation of the attack at San Bernardino’s Inland Regional Center told NBC News that the controller was similar to the model car controller used in the Boston Marathon bombing of 2013. Authorities said the design indicated that the attackers appeared to have calculated that their initial attack would draw a heavy law enforcement and emergency personnel response and left behind a device that would cause still greater casualties. The device did not explode, and investigators do not know if the controller was too far away to trigger the bomb. Forensic investigation of the device has not been completed.\n\n9:45 a.m.: Focus is shifting–slowly–to the victims and their families. The descriptions of the shootings are horrific, with people gunned down and shot while they hid beneath desks at was supposed to have been a festive holiday party. One victim whose name has been released, Denise Peraza, talked to her sister during the attack. She was wounded in the lower back and is recovering at Arrowhead Medical Center. Breitbart News’ National Security editor, Frances Martel has her story, and that of other victims. In addition to the five victims being treated at Arrowhead, five are being treated at Loma Linda University Medical Center, according to the Associated Press. Praise is being heard all around for the responses of area hospitals, as well as for the San Bernardino Police Department, which reportedly arrived on the scene of the shooting a mere four minutes after it began.\n\n9:20 a.m.: It’s terrorism, says CNN.\n\nCNN BREAKING: Farook was in touch with more than one international terrorism subjects –@evanperez — Vaughn Sterling (@vplus) December 3, 2015\n\n9:15 a.m.: Brian Ross of ABC News has coined a new term for the attack: “hybrid workplace jihad.” That is not a technical term, as it purports to be, but rather a way of bridging the political distance between what looks increasingly like an Islamic terror attack on the one hand, and President Barack Obama’s dogged insistence that it might be a Muslim couple simply “going postal.” Regarding that couple, there are now questions about the timing of their marriage. Their child–whom they left with relatives–was reportedly born in May, but they were only married earlier this year, reportedly. That raises questions about a premarital liaison–or perhaps about a sham marriage arranged for other reasons, perhaps for a pretext for Malik to be in the country. Still unclear. 8:35 a.m.: Liberal journalists are complaining about the New York Post‘s cover this morning, which bears the heading “Killer Muslims” in late editions. Ironically, some of these complaints come from people who praised the New York Daily News for its “God Isn’t Fixing This” headline, which mocked people (exclusively Republicans, on the cover) for sending prayers to victims.\n\nMeanwhile, the Council on American-Islamic Relations is ramping up complaints about “Islamophobia,” using the New York Post as a target–though its headline is 100% factually accurate.\n\n8:25 a.m.: President Barack Obama, addressing the media, has said that we do not know the motive of the San Bernardino killers, that it could be “workplace violence” or terrorism, and that we need to press forward with efforts at gun control, regardless. From Breitbart News’ Charlie Spiering:\n\nPresident Barack Obama says that it’s possible yesterday’s attack in California, where two people killed 14 and injured 17 others, was terrorist related. But he’s also holding out the possibility it was workplace violence. “It is possible that this is terrorist-related, but we don’t know; it is also possible this was workplace-related,” Obama said, adding, “we don’t know why they did it.\n\n8:15 a.m.: Fox News is reporting that all of the guns used in the attack were legally purchased. The killers were also armed to the teeth with extra ammunition, pipe bombs, remote-control cars, and “rollout bags,” in an apparent plan for a sustained attack with maximum casualties. The GoPro cameras were mounted on their uniforms–perhaps another piece of evidence linking them to terror, since the footage undoubtedly would have been used in jihadist propaganda. From the Fox News report:\n\nA law enforcement source told Fox News that the couple were each carrying an AR-15 rifle and a pistol – all later determined to have been legally purchased – when they were shot and killed by police after a brief chase in their black SUV about 2 miles from the initial shooting site. The source said the vehicle also contained so-called “rollout bags” with multiple pipe bombs, as well as additional ammunition. The couple also had GoPro cameras strapped to their body armor and wore tactical clothing, including vests stuffed with ammunition magazines. “That’s a military tactic for a sustained fight,” the source told Fox News of the rollout bags… In addition to the explosives found at the SUV, authorities discovered and detonated three pipe bombs late Wednesday at the Inland Regional Center, the complex where the initial shooting took place about 60 miles east of Los Angeles. Another source said investigators discovered multiple pipe bombs in the house, as well as small explosives strapped to remote-controlled cars.\n\n7:45 a.m.: The Democratic National Committee (DNC) has chosen an odd moment to attack Republicans for criticizing radical Islam. In a conference call Wednesday, which the DNC has been promoting Thursday morning, DNC chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) blasts Republicans for “demonizing an entire religion.” She also renewed her push for Syrian refugees to be admitted to the country, arguing that Syrian migrants today are like Jews fleeing the Holocaust before World War II:\n\n“We have seen this movie before. In May 1939, the SS St. Louis left Hamburg, Germany carrying more than 900 passengers, nearly all of them Jewish and seeking refuge in the United States. Our country turned them away, and many who were sent back to mainland Europe were killed in the Holocaust. Instead of learning from that mistake – Republican candidates and politicians were eager to repeat it,” she said.\n\n6:45 a.m.: A high school in Pacific Palisades, a Los Angeles neighborhood where many Hollywood celebrities live, has received a threat, according to the Palisadian-Post:\n\nBREAKING: Parents this evening received notification that Palisades Charter High School is on “high alert” due to an anonymous tip. According to Pali High Principal Pamela Magee, it was Palisades Charter Elementary School that received a threatening call today. “Pali High was notified of the alert and sent out a similar message about being on high alert due to the incident in [San Bernardino],” Magee told the \u202a#\u200epalipost\u202c. Pali Elementary could not be reached for comment.\n\nOne parent commented on Facebook: “Having received that call from Palisades Elementary School tonight I can say that while the call itself was disturbing the complete lack of update or follow up made it more so. The call didn’t say do or don’t send kids to school, so I think we have all been left wondering.” 6:40 a.m.: The Telegraph (UK), citing the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), reports that female suspect Tashfeen Malik is originally from Pakistan–not Russia, as some early reports erroneously claimed.\n\nThe couple had a child believed to have been born in May this year, according to Hussam Ayloush, Council of American Islamic Relation executive director. Farook’s family was originally from South Asia, while Malik was believed to be from Pakistan and had lived in Saudi Arabia before coming to the United States, Mr Ayloush said.\n\n5:45 a.m.: The Los Angeles Times reports that at least two of the four the guns recovered from the suspects were purchased legally.\n\nMeredith Davis, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said officials had “successfully traced” the four guns recovered in connection with the San Bernardino shooting and determined that two of the weapons were purchased legally…. Police officials said that two suspects, Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik, were armed with two assault rifles and two semiautomatic handguns. The assault rifles were a .223-caliber DPMS Model A15 and a Smith and Wesson M&P15. One of the handguns was manufactured by Llama, and the other by Smith and Wesson.\n\nIt is not clear whether the other two guns were obtained illegally, and, if so, which of the two were illegal. 6:10 a.m.: Breitbart California can now report that California Jerry Brown is not canceling plans to attend the Paris climate change conference this week–at least, not yet. 5:30 a.m.: Political correctness may have played a role, as suspicious neighbors declined to report the suspects for fear of “racial profiling.” CBS Los Angeles reports:\n\nNeighbors in Redlands were shocked that the suspects had ties to their area. “I was in awe that it was happening four houses down form my property,” one neighbor said. A man who has been working in the area said he noticed a half-dozen Middle Eastern men in the area in recent weeks, but decided not to report anything since he did not wish to racially profile those people. “We sat around lunch thinking, ‘What war they doing around the neighborhood?’” he said. “We’d see them leave where they’re raiding the apartment.”\n\n4:45 a.m.: Fox News reports that the suspects’ apartment was a “bomb-making factory,” with improvised explosive devices (IED) and remote-controlled cars for delivering explosives to their targets. The suspects are said to have attacked the holiday party wearing body armor and GoPro cameras to record their exploits. The couple had apparently left their young daughter with a grandparent, saying they had a doctor’s appointment to attend. The Inland Regional Center is now a crime scene, with victims’ bodies still apparently inside. Police have not yet released identifying details about the dead or wounded.\n\nDay One San Bernardino law enforcement authorities report a mass shooting involving at least 20 victims just before 11 a.m. Pacific time. Local news reports suggest that there are between one and three suspects, wearing masks and possibly body armor as well.\n\nSBFD units responding to reports of 20 victim shooting incident in 1300 block of S.

SBPD is working to clear the scene. — San Bernardino Fire (@SBCityFire) December 2, 2015\n\nSome media reports have indicated that the shooting is near a local Planned Parenthood clinic.\n\n“The planned parenthood clinic is only a few blocks away” – MSNBC just now — Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) December 2, 2015\n\nHowever, the clinic is over a mile away from the site of the shooting, according to Google Maps.\n\n10:27 p.m.: More updates from the press conference. FBI has not weighed in yet and, while law enforcement is open to labeling the attack terrorism, they have not yet settled on a motive: https://twitter.com/RaheemKassam/status/672296933730291713 https://twitter.com/RaheemKassam/status/672297284512550912 https://twitter.com/RaheemKassam/status/672297447968800769 https://twitter.com/RaheemKassam/status/672297595633561600 https://twitter.com/MichelleDiana/status/672297597571170304 https://twitter.com/RaheemKassam/status/672297788839870465 https://twitter.com/RaheemKassam/status/672297831332364288 https://twitter.com/RaheemKassam/status/672298760681066496 https://twitter.com/RaheemKassam/status/672298886677946369 https://twitter.com/RaheemKassam/status/672299117297594370 https://twitter.com/RaheemKassam/status/672299355055874048 https://twitter.com/RaheemKassam/status/672299664775884801 https://twitter.com/RaheemKassam/status/672299793729740800 https://twitter.com/RaheemKassam/status/672300359038009344 10:10 p.m.: Police press conference is underway.

I have absolutely no idea. I am in shock myself.” Khan does not answer questions from reporters. Executive Director of CAIR-LA says “We unequivocally condemn the horrific act that happened today.” 8:44 p.m.: A colleague says Syed Farook’s employer had recently held a baby shower for him. 8:42 p.m.: The husband of an wounded shooting victim gives her chilling account:\n\nThe shooters who opened fire in a conference room at a California center for the developmentally disabled Wednesday didn’t say anything before they started spraying the room with bullets, the husband of a woman who was shot but survived said. Salaheen Kondoker’s wife, Annie, an environmental engineer who works for San Bernardino County, was inside the conference room when gunfire erupted at around 11 a.m. local time. “They just started shooting … they didn’t yell or say anything beforehand,” Salaheen Kondoker said his wife told him.\n\n8:37 p.m.: From the Wall Street Journal: “Government records show Mr. Farook, a U.S. citizen, traveled to Saudi Arabia last year.” 8:22 p.m.: Photos from Raheem Kassam: This is the bag with a camouflage pattern that police and the bomb disposal robot cleared on the street. It contained books, toiletries, and men’s clothes. A police barrier on Richardson Street. 8:16 p.m.: From Jordan Schachtel: CAIR is preparing a press conference for 8:30 PM in Anaheim, California. Just an hour before Wednesday’s shooting in San Bernardino, CAIR was demanding the FBI get involved in an alleged desecration of a Quran:\n\nThe Greater Los Angeles Area office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-LA) today called on the FBI to investigate as a hate crime an incident in which an apparently bullet-riddled copy of the Quran, Islam’s holy text, was found outside of an Islamic clothing store. The owner of Al-Farah Islamic Clothing in Anaheim, Calif., found the English translation of the Quran pierced with multiple holes and hanging on the front door of the store Tuesday morning.\n\n8:13 p.m.: Mocking “thoughts and prayers” makes its way around the MSM: https://twitter.com/Walldo/status/672267064095019008 https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/672243875117944832 8:11 p.m.: And now, via Raheem Kassam, video of police clearing a suspicious package from the street: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwNnYXp3DWU 7:49 p.m.: Video of the bomb disposal robot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73TloY754U4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTvS2gRY8nQ 7:41 p.m.: Raheem Kassam: Police say they don’t know whether to expect a controlled explosion. There is a bag in the street. The bomb robot was near the bag but backed away. Police then asked reporters to move back another block. 7:37 p.m.: Via Raheem Kassam, police are currently deploying a bomb disposal robot: 7:32 p.m.: An unconfirmed account from a man claiming to be Farook’s father describes him as a “very religious” Muslim.\n\n“I haven’t heard anything. He worked in a county office,” Farook’s dad told The News. “He’s married and has a kid. We’re estranged because my wife got the divorce, and they are together. She doesn’t want to see me.” Farook said he hasn’t seen his son in some time. “He was very religious. He would go to work, come back, go to pray, come back. He’s Muslim.”\n\n7:13 p.m.: Raheem Kassam reports: Resident of Richardson St. says one suspect, he believes, was in a boat in the back of his neighbour’s house, an image reminiscent of the ending of the Boston Marathon bombing’s manhunt. Another resident says her 14 year-old daughter is home alone down Richardson St., where the crime scene is currently blocked off, and police will not allow the mother to go to her. https://twitter.com/cnnbrk/status/672255143203704832 7:10 p.m.: Dr. Ben Carson calls the San Bernardino slaughter a “hate crime”:\n\nWhen asked by ABC News to clarify what exactly he means by “hate crime” in this instance, Carson said, “Well it’s hard to imagine that you would shoot a bunch of people and not hate them, right? You don’t do that to people you love.”\n\n6:59 p.m.: Raheem Kassam and Michelle Moons report from San Bernardino (with video):\n\nThe town is eerily quiet, as you might expect following the atrocity in San Bernardino earlier today. … At the time of reporting, the police tell us San Bernardino Avenue is “still an active crime scene” and stated the fact there were multiple other active crime scenes.\n\n6:43 p.m.: The Daily Beast reports that a police warrant singled out an address belonging to Syed Farook. The article shares a purported Facebook photo of Farook (Update: The Daily Beast appeared to name the wrong person and the photo has been removed). 6:32 p.m.: NBC goes further and states that a second suspect could be Farook’s brother: https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/672239210531823616 6:15 p.m.: NBC News investigative reporter Tom Winter reports that law enforcement sources indicate one suspect may be a man named Sayeed Farook.\n\nMultiple law enforcement sources in multiple agencies tell NBC News that one of the suspects in the San Bernardino shooting is Sayeed Farook — Tom Winter (@Tom_Winter) December 3, 2015\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reports that its sources indicate the lead gunman was a U.S. citizen.\n\n6:00 p.m.: Adelle Nazarian of Breitbart News notes that CNN analysts say the attack looks like terrorism:\n\nSpeaking on CNN’s Out Front with Erin Burnett Wednesday, former CIA case officer Robert Baer said the most “disturbing” aspect of the deadly San Bernardino shooting is that it was carried out using tactics that are employed in the Middle East. “What I don’t like about this shooting is multiple shooters… IEDs… I say this very reluctantly, but this has the hallmarks of the sort of attacks you see in the Middle East,” Baer said. Former FBI special agent Robert Chacon agreed with Baer’s assertions later on in the show.\n\nMeanwhile, local NBC News is reporting the progress of the SWAT team in entering the Redlands house of one of the suspects:\n\nDEVELOPING: SWAT vehicle ramming home in Redlands, Calif., near San Bernardino. LIVE: https://t.co/y9ZPtcRopy pic.twitter.com/KLZ08LeW9O — NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) December 3, 2015\n\n5:45 p.m.: The local police chief says that the suspects came to the scene “dressed and equipped.” They had “assault-style” rifles. The device that officers feared was a pipe bomb turned out not to be an explosive. It is possible the third suspect was not involved. 5:42 p.m.: Local and federal law enforcement authorities are addressing a press conference. The new casualty numbers are 14 dead and 17 wounded. Two of the suspects–one male, one female–are dead. A third has been detained. None has yet been identified and their ages have not been given. A home linked to a suspect is being searched in Redlands–“very cautiously,” says the FBI, given the potential for booby traps. The FBI says that terrorism is a “possibility” but still not certain: “It is a possibility but we don’t know that yet. And we’re not wiling to go down that road yet.” 5:15 p.m.: CNN reports that the conference center at the Inland Regional Center, which is where the shooting took place, had been rented by San Bernadino County personnel for the purpose of holding an annual holiday party. 4:55 p.m.: CNN reports that a home in Redlands, CA is being searched and that one of the suspects apparently lives there. The reports of pipe bombs have been confirmed. The suspects apparently threw them from the SUV to distract police during the chase. 4:43 p.m.: Via AFP:\n\nSan Bernardino (United States) (AFP) – “Suspects are down” in the hunt for as many as three gunmen who opened fire at a center for the disabled in California on Wednesday, killing at least 14 people, police said. San Bernardino police chief Jarrod Burguan tweeted: “Suspects are down, one officer wounded. Details still unfolding.” He warned residents living near the scene of the police confrontation with the suspects to stay in their homes.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SBPDChief/status/672207605129863169 4:25 p.m.: Rick Serrano of the Los Angeles Times reports that federal officials believe the shooting is a kind of workplace dispute. Federal officials also regarded the Fort Hood terror attack as workplace violence.\n\n4:13 p.m.: Vicki Cervantes of the San Bernadino Police Department told reporters that one suspect is down, one being “dealt with,” and another possible being pursued. Another update is promised at 4:45 p.m. PST. Meanwhile, California Gov. Jerry Brown has issued a simple statement: “Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims’ families and everyone affected by the brutal attack. California will spare no effort in bringing these killers to justice.” He also ordered flags at the State Capitol lowered to half-staff. One report indicates that ISIS supporters are celebrating the attack on Twitter. 3:55 p.m.: Police scanner reports one suspect as “female Arabic.” Neighbors are calling police to report a fleeing suspect with an orange shirt and camouflage pants. Gov. Jerry Brown has canceled this evening’s Christmas tree-lighting ceremony, according to the Sacramento Bee. 3:52 p.m.: One reporter says that all the suspects are “dead or in custody.” But police scanners are humming with reports of suspects seen at the local Rite-Aid, the Wells Fargo parking lot, and in other locations, some apparently wearing masks. Police want people to stay in their homes. 3:47 p.m.: Mayor R. Carey Davis has posted a statement on Facebook responding to the shooting, calling for unity and prayer. 3:43 p.m.: Police scanner reports a suspect “north of Gould, south of Richardson, to the rear of a church.” The suspect appears to be the one in an orange shirt and camouflage pants.

They may be looking for others. They are clearing an area of San Bernadino Avenue. There is chatter on the police scanner about a “pipe bomb.” 3:23 p.m.: Police report one suspect in custody and one fleeing on foot. They have established a perimeter around a residential neighborhood in San Bernadino. 3:15 p.m.: Police scanners report an officer down and a pursuit in the area of 2nd Street and Bryant Street in San Bernadino, which are parallel east-west streets about 2.5 miles due north of the site of the shooting. 3:12 p.m. Police scanners are reporting that officers have exchanged fire with the occupant(s) of a black SUV. One reports “suspect down in the westbound lane” of the 10 freeway. Helicopter shots from KABC show police vehicles surrounding someone on the ground, and a car crashed nearby. Earlier scanner reports indicated a chase at 110 mph, but it was not clear if it was related. 3:05 p.m.: The Los Angeles Times has posted amateur video of the shooting by a nurse at the center who watched police storm the building and thought at the time that they were carrying out a drill, not an actual response to an active shooter situation. 3:00 p.m.: There are conflicting reports from police. Publicly, police seem to be saying that they do not know who the suspects are, or where they are. On the police scanner, however, there is talk of “two at gunpoint” and pursuit of a male in camouflage. The Chicago Tribune reports that 10 of the wounded are in critical condition, three in serious condition.\n\nUpdate: 10 of the wounded in San Bernardino shooting in critical condition, 3 serious https://t.co/4wSNDTF19p — Chicago Tribune (@chicagotribune) December 2, 2015\n\n2:40 p.m.: Breitbart News’ John Nolte weighs in on the reaction of some in the liberal media:\n\nAs good people on social media watched unspeakable events unfurl in San Bernadino, California, on their television sets, all one could do in a situation where you can really do nothing is pray and offer those prayers to the world. Naturally, elite members of our media will use any opportunity to mock the Faithful. Even 14 still-warm dead bodies won’t stop them from attacking those who offer a heartfelt “thoughts and prayers” sentiment.\n\n2:30 p.m.: Police told reporters at the news conference that they can neither confirm nor deny the shooting is a terrorist attack. The FBI has said similar things, according to Fox News, which adds that police say that “at minimum, we have a domestic terror situation.” The suspects came as if “on a mission.” It appears less likely that this is a workplace shooting or a random attack.\n\n#BreakingNews witness described one possible suspect as large guy dressed in black, wearing a black mask with a large gun. #SBShootings — Randy Mac (@RandyNBCLA) December 2, 2015\n\n2:10 p.m.: Various reports on the police scanner suggest possible sightings of the weapons used in the shooting, and possibly a suspect as well: “Vehicle on golf course with multiple weapons inside.

The Los Angeles Times reports:\n\nThe Arrowhead Regional Medical Center, which is reportedly treating some victims of the shooting, will be on lockdown for at least the next six hours, security guards said.

None of the suspected gunmen are in custody and all are presumed armed and dangerous. Speaking with local ABC News reporters, police have confirmed “fatalities” and “some type of function” at the center.\n\n1:00 p.m.: The area near the Inland Regional Center remains locked down, including civic buildings. There are numerous unconfirmed report of a suspect’s name, which Breitbart News is unable to confirm and therefore cannot report at this time.\n\n12:40 p.m.: Though the active shooter situation is still ongoing, Democrats are not losing the opportunity to weigh in on gun control, the National Rifle Association, and other pet causes.\n\nI refuse to accept this as normal.

(AP)\n\n© Thomson Reuters 2015\n\nGunmen opened fire on a holiday party on Wednesday at a social services agency in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people and wounding 17 others before fleeing, authorities said.As an intense manhunt for up to three suspects ensued , San Bernardino police reported one "suspect down" in an exchange of gunfire with officers but did not immediately confirm whether the individual was connected to the shooting.The shooting rampage at the Inland Regional Center about 60 miles (100 km) east of Los Angeles marked the deadliest U.S. gun violence since the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012, in which 27 people, including the gunman, were killed.San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said in a televised news briefing three hours after Wednesday\'s shooting that the suspects were believed to have made their getaway in a deer-coloured sport utility vehicle.A vehicle matching that description turned up at the shootout with police several hours later, city police spokeswoman Sergeant Vicki Cervantes. She said the number of wounded rose to 17.With suspects at large, authorities ordered a security "lockdown" of all local schools, as well as city and county buildings, and area hospitals were placed on alert, Burguan said.Burguan said he knew of no possible motive behind the attack, which unfolded at about 11 a.m."We have no information at this point that this is terrorist-related, in the traditional sense that people may be thinking," he added. "Obviously, at minimum, we have a domestic-type terrorist-type situation that occurred here."He said the suspects were armed with rifles.The shooting unfolded on the campus of the Inland Regional Center, one of 21 facilities set up by the state and run under contract by non-profit organizations to serve people with developmental disabilities, said Nancy Lungren, spokeswoman for the California Department of Developmental Services.Lavinia Johnson, executive director of the facility, told CNN the suspects opened fire inside a conference building in the complex where a holiday party was being held for county health department personnel.The conference building sits adjacent to the two larger three-story buildings that house most of the agency\'s offices at the complex, Johnson said. Asked whether that meant that the Inland Regional Center staff and clients were safe, she said she understood they were being evacuated.So far in 2015, there have been more than 350 shootings in which four or more people died, according to the crowd-sourced website shootingtracker.com, which keeps a running tally of mass shootings.The shooting in California comes less than a week after a gunman killed three people and wounded nine in a shooting rampage at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Colorado. In October, a gunman killed nine people at a college in Oregon, and in June, a white gunman killed nine black churchgoers in South Carolina. Gun control advocates, including Democratic President Barack Obama, say easy access to firearms is a major factor in the shooting epidemic, while the National Rifle Association and other pro-gun advocates say the Second Amendment of the US Constitution guarantees Americans the right to bear arms.', 'title': "14 Killed in California Mass Shooting, 'Suspect Down' Says Police", 'url': 'https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/california-police-respond-to-shooter-report-1250398', 'keywords': ['shooting', 'bernardino', 'mass', 'suspects', 'killed', '14', 'inland', 'center', 'suspect', 'regional', 'california', 'gunman', 'san'], 'tags': {'San Bernardino', 'California shooting', 'Reuters', 'California'}, 'summary': 'Survivors are evacuated from the scene of a shooting under police and sheriff\'s escort on December 2, 2015 in San Bernardino, California.\n(AFP Photo)San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan, right, talks to the media near the the site of a mass shooting on Wednesday, December 2, 2015, in San Bernardino, California.\n"Obviously, at minimum, we have a domestic-type terrorist-type situation that occurred here.\nIn October, a gunman killed nine people at a college in Oregon, and in June, a white gunman killed nine black churchgoers in South Carolina.\nGun control advocates, including Democratic President Barack Obama, say easy access to firearms is a major factor in the shooting epidemic, while the National Rifle Association and other pro-gun advocates say the Second Amendment of the US Constitution guarantees Americans the right to bear arms.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'Police were hunting Wednesday for multiple gunmen who opened fire inside a social services building in San Bernardino in California, with reports of at least 14 dead and 14 injured.\n\nAlthough only 3 have so far been confirmed dead, a reporter with ABC 7 said that around 12 had been killed, and that SWAT teams were scouring the building.\n\nSeveral hundred people in the building at time of the shooting were safely evacuated, police said.\n\nA Washington D.C.-based affiliate of ABC reported, without attribution, that the shooting suspects may have left the scene in a black SUV.\n\nThe FBI said it did not know if the shooting was a terrorist incident.

They've chased it gun battle ensued all the witnesses who saw blown out of that truck they could fire back at police one officer injured he's expected. To be okay that is good news tonight I want to bring in our experts were going to do around here Brad Garrett metals and standing by Brian Ross with new reporting here first Brad Garrett who. Spent many years with the FBI and Brad affected their at their home tonight. Tells you what. Well it tells us that they obviously drove home after the shooting. Described about ten and miles away so they are part of this community. It is also is helpful. Because when you have people better in the community with the crime occurs. The intelligence you can collect can be very timely in addition to what obviously Brian is talking about computers phones except for a is that the circle of people they associate with probably are also close by. So drawing a circle as to who's involved who knew about it who participated in it. I think hurt they're going to be able to pull that together and fairly issue. Order order Fred thank you let's get right to Brian he does have new reporting about another possible link to this story discovered in that home. That's right David records reviewed by ABC news show that one of the people who lived in this home now been surged. Was in fact an employee.

Very eye opening let's bring in Mandelson who used to be the national director counter terrorism he would often briefed President Obama now part of our team in Matt. You know if it was still your job there at the White House what would you be telling the president tonight about your hunch. With what's developed this evening the fact the number two with the FBI saying there that we have to we at least have to explore the possibility here. That this man this woman might have been inspired and that there could have been perhaps more people involved in this attack. Rain and everything we've seen so far we still don't know and and I think that's one of the key points that I would be making and I and it sounds like that's exactly where the White House as we still don't know whether this is terrorism or not that last detail that we just learned from Brian Ross. Is really very significant in that it does tight back to some sort of possible workplace violence as opposed to for example. A foreign terrorist organization by crisis so it's just really important right now to remain. Open to any of these possibilities. Mandelson things to you our thanks to Brian here where this Brad Garrett our entire team on the scene in Southern California want to bring everyone up to speed.

One man one woman their relationship unknown assault style weapons discovered in that SUV they were wearing tactical gear tactical clothing a third person seen running from the vehicle has been detained. They are in Southern California unclear. Whether that person has been labeled a suspect at this hour but no doubt likely being questioned. They are surrounding that house in Redlands California where it's believed Brian Ross reporting earlier that might have been phoned him. That led authorities there to begin with the if so that would be. An extraordinary development in the case of perhaps it was a community member who put their hand opens at something is wrong in our neighborhood. The Redlands California by the went up ten miles from where all this for unfolded today in. And of course Brian reporting just moments ago that. They are exploring the possibility that one of those people in that home could have been connected to the Health Department there and we know was a holiday party. Set up by the Health Department.

Hours after the attack, police pursued information that led to a chase of a dark SUV, which was later determined to be a rental car. A shootout between police and the suspects left both suspects dead. The suspects were identified as Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik, who were husband and wife.\n\nAccording to federal law enforcement authorities, the four guns used in the shooting were purchased legally. The suspects were found to have 1,600 rounds of ammunition with them, and at a home the suspects were renting in Redlands, California, law enforcement officers found 4,500 rounds of ammunition and 12 pipe bombs. No official motive has been confirmed, though a source told the Los Angeles Times that investigators are considering a combined motive of "terrorism and workplace."\n\nEarlier: On Wednesday morning, just hours after the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill campus lifted a lockdown warning, an active shooter situation developed across the country at a service center for developmentally disabled people in San Bernardino, California. As many as 20 victims were initially reported "down," with three alleged suspects reported to be wearing body armor. As of Wednesday afternoon, SBPD Chief Jarrod Burguan says that "upwards of 14 people ... are dead [and] upwards of 14 people that are injured." Multiple law enforcement agencies promptly responded and began issuing updates on Twitter, while the country yet again braced itself for another horrific shooting and its aftermath. 2015 has seen over 350 mass shootings so far.\n\nThat the shooting took place in California is particularly remarkable, given that it has the most restrictive gun laws in the United States, thanks to a highly progressive legislature. Anyone who wishes to purchase a gun in California must produce a Firearm Safety Certificate, and must purchase a "California legal" gun which complies with stringent mandates on what can and cannot be sold within state borders. Sales include a waiting period, and must be conducted through a licensed dealer, and the state constitution doesn\'t guarantee firearms rights, though federal suits are pending against the state on the grounds that some of its laws may violate the Second Amendment.\n\nSome look to California as a model for possible reforms to gun control. But as the San Bernardino shooting — and the more than 20 other shootings in the state listed by the Mass Shooting Tracker — illustrates, even those laws aren\'t enough. This shouldn\'t come as a particular surprise, because while California law may seem extremely strict to some, it\'s highly loose when compared with gun control laws in other nations, like New Zealand, Japan, and Britain. In such places, gun ownership is so tightly controlled that in many cases, it is functionally impossible to legally own a firearm.\n\nConservatives are already leaping on California\'s gun laws as evidence that even "strict gun control" doesn\'t work, but they\'re missing the larger and critical picture here: The state\'s gun control isn\'t terribly strict on a global scale — only nationally.\n\nThe failure of California\'s gun control in this case — and the nation\'s more broadly — can be attributed to one thing: the gun lobby, and its concerted and highly effective attempts at fighting any potential limitation on the sale of firearms and associated paraphernalia, often with the direct assistance of some of the most powerful politicians in America. The United States has always been a nation of the gun, with an identity deeply bound to gun ownership in many regions of the country. The lack of ability to distinguish between the public interest and private freedom has long been a problem for social reforms in general, and gun control in particular.\n\nIn a country founded on individual liberties, one where personal freedom is highly prized, the thought of legislation which hinders private ownership of firearms is deeply terrifying to some. The gun lobby exploits such fears as it viciously fights any attempt to limit gun ownership. Whether it\'s funding political campaigns or taking advantage of special legal protections, it\'s dominated the conversation on the subject. With mass shootings coming so fast and thick that a day doesn\'t pass without one, gun lobbyists insist that people not "politicize tragedy." But it\'s impossible not to; the United States is in a state of perpetual tragedy and eternal gun crisis, and it will be until the issue of its unconscionably lax gun laws is resolved. (The NRA has yet to comment on this most recent shooting.)\n\nAs Americans insist on keeping refugees on the other side of our borders, we ignore the crisis of violence that makes it unsafe to go to the movies, attend a political rally, participate in K-12 education, be present on a college campus, work in or need services from an abortion clinic, or (in this case) access social services. Simply being outside, let alone accessing public accommodations, is becoming a dangerous proposition in the United States, and the gun lobby resolutely refuses to take responsibility for this.\n\nConservatives are already leaping on California\'s gun laws as evidence that even "strict gun control" doesn\'t work, but they\'re missing the larger and critical picture here: The state\'s gun control isn\'t terribly strict on a global scale — only nationally.\n\nWhen compared to other states, California is performing better than others when it comes to mass shootings per capita, but that isn\'t much of an accomplishment. While conservatives and liberals alike can agree that California\'s gun control wasn\'t adequate to prevent the shooting in San Bernardino, they differ on why. The problem isn\'t that the laws were too strict, and that shooters would acquire guns by any means possible and thus that we should give up on gun control altogether. It\'s that the laws are patently not strict enough.\n\nWe don\'t yet know enough about the shootings in San Bernardino to determine all the factors involved — how many shooters there actually were, which weapons were used, whether those weapons were legally acquired. What we do know is that in a state known for tough gun laws passed over considerable complaint from the gun lobby, people still manage to acquire weapons for use against civilians.\n\nPresident Obama stated in response to the Planned Parenthood shooting that occurred last week that:\n\nThis is not normal. We can’t let it become normal. If we truly care about this — if we’re going to offer up our thoughts and prayers again, for God knows how many times, with a truly clean conscience — then we have to do something about the easy accessibility of weapons of war on our streets to people who have no business wielding them. Period. Enough is enough.\n\nHe wasn\'t wrong. This shouldn\'t be normal, and this shouldn\'t be the face of America, domestically and for the world. But it is. Citizens of most of the West and a fair chunk of the Global South are shocked by how insufficient our gun laws are, and they should be. What private individual needs to own a long gun? A handgun kept anywhere other than a range for recreational shooting? Military-grade equipment? We aren\'t living in an era in which we need a "well-regulated militia." In fact, the organizations calling themselves "militias" today tend to land on the Southern Poverty Law Center\'s list of known hate groups on a regular basis. These are precisely the people we don\'t want carrying guns. Many of them are terrorists disrupting American society and inculcating us with a sense of deep fear of going about our daily business.\n\nWe can blame the gun lobby for all of this, and we should keep blaming the gun lobby until Congress cannot avoid this problem any longer. Even though we keep saying this after every mass shooting, it is apparently not enough. We must march on Congress, we must lean on our representatives, and we must vote for candidates who promise to take aggressive stances on gun control. We owe it to our dead, if not to ourselves.', 'title': 'California Has The Toughest Gun Control In the Country, And That Might Be Exactly The Point', 'url': 'https://www.bustle.com/articles/127272-california-has-the-toughest-gun-control-in-the-country-and-that-might-be-exactly-the-point', 'keywords': ['shooting', 'states', 'state', 'laws', 'country', 'strict', 'gun', 'suspects', 'lobby', 'california', 'exactly', 'control', 'toughest', 'point'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Conservatives are already leaping on California\'s gun laws as evidence that even "strict gun control" doesn\'t work, but they\'re missing the larger and critical picture here: The state\'s gun control isn\'t terribly strict on a global scale — only nationally.\nThe gun lobby exploits such fears as it viciously fights any attempt to limit gun ownership.\nConservatives are already leaping on California\'s gun laws as evidence that even "strict gun control" doesn\'t work, but they\'re missing the larger and critical picture here: The state\'s gun control isn\'t terribly strict on a global scale — only nationally.\nWe can blame the gun lobby for all of this, and we should keep blaming the gun lobby until Congress cannot avoid this problem any longer.\nWe must march on Congress, we must lean on our representatives, and we must vote for candidates who promise to take aggressive stances on gun control.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'click to enlarge SUSPECT VEHICLE: Officers surround car after chase and gun battle with suspects in shooting.\n\nMultiple media report an "active shooter" and as many as 20 people hit in San Bernardino, Calif.Up to 20 were shot, the LA Times has reported, in a social services office that provides help to people with developmental disabilities.

We know that. We do not know why. We don't know if this was the intended target or if there was something that triggered him to do this immediately,' said David Bowdich, assistant director of the FBI's Los Angeles office.\n\nAt the White House, President Barack Obama said after meeting with his national security team that it was 'possible this was terrorist-related' but that authorities were unsure. He raised the possibility that it was a workplace dispute or that mixed motives were at play.\n\nHe lamented it is 'just too easy' for mass shootings to occur in America as he called for a new push on gun control in the wake of the latest attack.\n\n'I do think as the investigation moves forward, it's going to be important for all of us, including our legislatures, to see what we can do to make sure that when individuals decide that they want to do somebody harm, we're making it a little harder for them to do it.\n\n'Because right now, it's just too easy,' he added.\n\nCalifornia Senator Dianne Feinstein, who had a classified briefing by the FBI in her role as top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, told The LA Times she has questioned the role of the woman suspect.\n\nThe pair are believed to have used the same pipe bomb designs used by the Tsarnaev brothers in their attack on Boston.

So it's going to be very interesting for me to see what her background was, what level of animus she had, because she had to have had a considerable level.'\n\n'This was his grievance,' she added.\n\n'A woman is a woman. And her child has to be of maximum importance to her.'\n\nShe made the comments in Capitol Hill after Democrats introduced bills to stem gun violence for a Thursday vote.\n\nLaw enforcement experts said investigators may well conclude the killers had more than one motivation.\n\nInspire, Al Qaeda's online magazine (left), which is believed to have insipred Dzhokar Tsarnaev's bomb design's, has outlined how to make the bomb from household goods and without using metal components that would show up in airport security checks\n\nEvidence tags and debris surround the SUV that is thought to be the getaway vehicle of the suspects.

He also mentioned that Farook traveled to Pakistan at some point, but he would not go into detail.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Farook and Malik dropped off their six-month-old baby with Farook's mother, according to KTLA, saying they were going to a doctor's appointment.\n\nBy noon, according to police, the couple had donned assault clothing, armed themselves with rifles and stormed a holiday party attended by San Bernardino County employees, killing 14 people and wounding 21 others.\n\nThey fired as many as 75 rifle rounds at the SUV scene and had had over 1,600 more bullets with them. Then, at their Redlands home they found the armory which could have inflicted untold damage\n\nBefore sunset, after a massive manhunt and a violent shootout with police on a residential street in the city of Redlands, Farook and Malik lay dead.\n\nBy early Thursday afternoon, the first of the victims of the San Bernardino massacre have been identified as three health department workers.\n\nDamian Meins, 58; Nicholas Thalasinos, 52; and Michael Wetzel, 37, were among the 14 shot dead inside at the Inland Regional Center on Wednesday.\n\nThalasinos's wife, Jennifer, told the New York Times her husband was a co-worker of Malik Farook's at the health department and the two appeared friendly.\n\nMeins had only been working at the San Bernardino County of Environmental Health Department for three months when he was shot dead.

The 37-year-old leaves behind a wife, Renee, and six children.\n\nThose who knew Malik Farook, among them his colleagues at the San Bernardino County Public Health Department, described him as a devout Muslim but not someone who often talked about religion.\n\n'He never struck me as a fanatic, he never struck me as suspicious,' said Griselda Reisinger, a former colleague.\n\nCo-worker Patrick Baccari, who shared a cubicle with Farook, told the Los Angeles Times he and his young family appeared to be 'living the American dream.'\n\nFBI agents investigate a car in front of at a townhouse in Redlands, California, linked to Farook and Malik\n\nPresident Barack Obama addressed the shooting from the Oval Office shortly before noon Eastern Time, saying it is possible the massacre in San Bernardino was related to terrorism, but it's also possible it was workplace-related\n\nNation in mourning: The American flag over the White House is lowered to half staff to honor the victims of the San Bernardino shootings\n\n'I'LL TAKE A BULLET BEFORE YOU DO, THAT'S FOR DAMN SURE': BRAVE COP REASSURES PEOPLE TRAPPED INSIDE MASSACRE CONFERENCE CENTER This is the moment a brave San Bernardino cop reassured terrified workers inside the Inland Regional Center that he would take a bullet to save them.

I\'m sure she got the visa in Pakistan," State Department Deputy Spokesman Mark Toner told reporters at his daily news conference yesterday.Tashfeen Malik\'s parents had immigrated from Pakistan. She along with her husband Syed Rizwan Farook were involved in a mass shooting at a holiday party in San Bernardino that killed 14 people and injured at least 17, the police said."She was issued the K-1 visa - which is normally given to fiance - by the US Embassy in Islamabad.

Farook\'s brother-in-law, Farhan Khan, said the couple got married two years ago.Farook was a US citizen, while Tashfeen was in the US on a Pakistani passport and had a K1 "fiance visa", according to David Bowdich, assistant director of the Los Angeles Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) office."She was issued, a K-1 so- called "fiance visa" in 2012.

They were totally shocked.”\n\nChesley said the family and lawyers have been in communication with the FBI. On Friday, the FBI’s assistant director of its Los Angeles bureau David Bowdich said that based on new information, the bureau is “now investigating these horrific acts as an act of terrorism.”\n\nFarook, 28, and his 27-year-old wife, Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people and wounded 21 at a holiday party hosted by his employer, the county’s public health department, on Wednesday morning. Immediately after the attack, authorities were not sure if the mass shooting was an act of terrorism or workplace violence.\n\nChesley and fellow attorney Mohammad Abuershaid said authorities have yet to link Farook or Malik to a larger terrorist organization. “What we’re saying is we still have to wait for the investigation to be done before we make any kind of determination,” Abuershaid explained.\n\n“Every headline doesn't have to say ‘Muslim massacre,’” Chesley added. “We’re just making sure we aren’t overzealous in our characterization of these events one way or another.”\n\nOn Saturday, though, the Islamic State (ISIS) claimed in an online radio broadcast that the married couple were followers of the militant group, Reuters reported.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nRelatives of the gunmen have been threatened by phone and online, the attorneys said. Abuershaid said it was particularly damaging to Farook’s brother, who was misidentified as the gunman in photographs in the aftermath of the attacks. Farook’s mother lived with the couple, and was questioned for about seven hours by the FBI.\n\n“She hates what happened, she’s very mournful about all the victims,” Chesley said.\n\nEarlier on Friday, a Facebook executive said that Malik created an online posting praising ISIS as the deadly attacks were happening, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe statement by the executive, who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity, seems to confirm a similar announcement from authorities that Malik posted to Facebook pledging allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi before carrying out the mass shooting with her husband.\n\nThe Facebook executive said that Malik created the post under an alias account at 11 a.m. Wednesday, which is just when 911 calls about the attacks began. The social media website says that it has taken down the alias account.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News, Farhan Khan, Farook’s brother-in-law, said he has “no idea” what led to the shooting rampage. The couple, he added, led ordinary lives.\n\n“[Farook was] a good religious person, just like normal anybody would be,” Khan said. But he stressed that “he was not radical.”\n\n“Islam does not agree and does not support any kind of actions that occur like this. It does not support killing,” Abuershaid said.\n\nAuthorities found 12 pipe bombs inside the family’s home after the attacks took place. Both lawyers stressed that while the family had get-togethers at their home, relatives never saw any evidence of bomb-making materials.\n\nBowdich, the FBI agent, added that it was “certainly a possibility” the two were planning another attack. But no other suspects are currently under arrest in relation to the shooting, he said.\n\nThe couple attempted to destroy a large volume of physical and digital evidence, he said.\n\n“It is early, we are still working very hard to understand,” Comey said. “There is a lot of evidence in this case that doesn't quite make sense.”\n\nThe FBI didn’t previously have information in its holdings about the two suspects, he added.\n\nEarlier on Friday, some media organizations streamed live footage of reporters looking around inside the suspects’ home. At the press conference, reporters asked Bowdich how members of the press gained access to the residence.\n\n“Once we turn that location back over to the occupants of that residence...anyone who goes in, that’s got nothing to do with us,” he said. After officials execute a lawful search warrant, they have to leave behind a list of all the items seized for the owner, he said.\n\nSan Bernardino Police Department Chief Jarrod Burguan said his officers, who are working around the clock, will continue to be part of the investigation, but he has officially turned over the investigation to the FBI.\n\nAuthorities believe Malik is from Pakistan and had lived in Saudi Arabia, and that Farook was born in the United States. The two suspects came to the U.S. together in July 2014, officials told reporters Thursday. They had a 6-month-old child whom they reportedly left with a grandmother before the shooting on Wednesday morning.\n\nMalik was in the United States on a K-1 visa, Burguan said Thursday. She had recently visited Pakistan. She was described as “very conservative” by Chesley. “She was a caring housewife,” Chesley said.\n\nMalik wore a burqa and was “totally covered,” Abuershaid said.\n\nSpeaking with NBC News earlier Friday, Khan expressed his anger that the couple left behind their baby daughter. He said he has begun the legal process to adopt the child.\n\n“The FBI has been willing to release [the child] to one of the family members,” Abuershaid said.

Law enforcement sources also said Farook had traveled to Saudi Arabia earlier this year.\n\nAuthorities also obtained a search warrant for Farook and Malik\'s home. Police sent robots into the house to detonate multiple suspected explosive devices before law enforcement officers entered. One source later called the home an IED making facility. The vehicle in which the suspects died also contained "roll out bags" full of explosives and ammunition, indications that Farook and Malik were not finished with the killing for the day.\n\nAuthorities have not yet drawn connections between Farook and international terror groups, but the Islamic State took to social media and praised the attack of the "three lions" involved in the attack. Police initially said a third suspect was part of the plot, but have said little about that claim since the shootings took place.\n\nOne of the social media posts carried the moniker "#America_Burning."\n\n"Three lions made us proud. They are still alive," another tweet said, according to analysis of the Arabic-language tweets by Vocativ. It also claimed, "California streets are full with soldiers with heavy weapons. The United States is burning. #America_Burning # Takbir."\n\n"Takbir" is a term used to refer to the general call of jihadists, "God is Greater" – or "Allah Akbar." Normally, the refrain is shouted by terrorists as they kill. However, no witness to the San Bernardino shooting has yet reported hearing either of the gunmen shouting the phrase.\n\nAnother Islamic State supporter posted to a social media forum, "God is great and he the one to be praised for that. This is hell with god\'s will."\n\nAnother posted on Twitter, "God is the greatest. May god spread fear in the homes of the Crusaders."\n\nShortly after the incident occurred, the Council on American Islamic Relations sought to get out in front of the crisis and condemn the shooting, an unusual step for the organization and one that indicates it believed the action likely was a terrorist act.\n\n"We condemn this horrific and revolting attack and offer our heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of all those killed or injured," the executive director of CAIR\'s Los Angeles office, Hussam Ayloush, said in a press release before the press conference. "The Muslim community stands shoulder to shoulder with our fellow Americans in repudiating any twisted mindset that would claim to justify such sickening acts of violence."\n\nMuzammil Siddiqi, director of the Islamic Society of Orange County, spoke at the press conference.\n\n"We have condemned all violence, everywhere," Siddiqi said. "Our faith has nothing to do with [the shooting]; our faith is against this kind of behavior."\n\nA visibly shaken Farhan Khan, brother-in-law of the deceased suspect, Syed Farook, said, "Why would he do something like this? I have absolutely no idea.

It removed the profile from public view and reported its contents to law enforcement. Bowdich also says the couple crushed two cell phones and discarded them in a trash bin.\n\nRecommended Stories For You\n\nThe Islamic State-affiliated news agency Aamaq said Friday the two shooters were “supporters” of the group, but it stopped short of claiming responsibility for the attack.\n\nBowdich said he was not aware of the report but wasn’t surprised IS would attempt to link itself to the attack. He said investigators are looking carefully to determine if there is an IS connection.\n\nFBI Director James Comey cautioned that the bureau’s investigation has not yet shown evidence that the slain shooting suspects were part of a larger group or members of a terror cell. Comey said that despite growing signs of radicalization among the two suspects, there “is a lot evidence that doesn’t quite make sense.” He said the suspects did not appear on the FBI’s “radar screen” prior to the shooting.\n\nFarook and Malik rented a townhome where investigators said they found an arsenal of ammunition and homemade bombs. On Friday morning, the property’s owner allowed reporters inside. Bowdich said the FBI was done with the scene.\n\nMalik, 27, was a Pakistani who grew up in Saudi Arabia and came to the U.S. in 2014 on a fiancée visa. Farook, a 28-year-old restaurant health inspector for the county, was born in Chicago to Pakistani parents and raised in Southern California.\n\nAnother U.S. official said Malik expressed “admiration” for the extremist group’s leader on Facebook under the alias account. But the official said there was no evidence that anyone affiliated with the Islamic State communicated back, and there was no evidence of any operational instructions being conveyed to her.\n\nThe two U.S. officials were not authorized to discuss the case publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nUntil Friday, federal and local law enforcement officials said terrorism was a possibility — but the violence could have stemmed from a workplace grudge or a combination of motives.\n\nLaw enforcement officials have long warned that Americans acting in sympathy with Islamic extremists — though not on direct orders — could launch an attack inside the U.S. Using slick propaganda, the Islamic State in particular has urged sympathizers worldwide to commit violence in their countries.\n\nOthers have done so. In May, just before he attacked a gathering in Texas of people drawing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad, a Phoenix man tweeted his hope that Allah would view him as a holy warrior.\n\nTwo weeks ago, with Americans on edge over the Islamic State attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead, Comey said that U.S. authorities had no specific or credible intelligence pointing to an attack on American soil.\n\nSeventy-one people have been charged in the U.S. since March 2014 in connection with supporting ISIS, including 56 this year, according to a recent report from the George Washington University Program on Extremism. Though most are men, “women are taking an increasingly prominent role in the jihadist world,” the report said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether Malik exhibited any support for radical Islamists before she arrived in the U.S. — or, like scores of others arrested by the FBI, became radicalized through online or in-person associations after arriving.\n\nFriends of the soft-spoken Farook who knew him from his daily prayers at a mosque in San Bernardino said they saw nothing to make them think he was violent. They said Farook reported meeting his future wife online.\n\nTo receive her visa, Malik was subjected to a vetting process the U.S. government describes as vigorous. It includes in-person interviews, fingerprints, checks against terrorist watch lists and reviews of her family members, travel history and places where she lived and worked.\n\nForeigners applying from countries that are home to Islamic extremists — such as Pakistan — undergo additional scrutiny before the State Department and Homeland Security approve their applications.\n\nPakistani intelligence officials said Malik moved as a child with her family to Saudi Arabia 25 years ago.\n\nThe two officials, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said that the family is originally from a town in Punjab province and that the father initially moved to Saudi Arabia around three decades ago for work.\n\nAnother person close to the Saudi government said Tashfeed Malik didn’t stay in Saudi Arabia, eventually returning to Pakistan and living in the capital Islamabad, though she returned to Saudi Arabia for visits. The person was not authorized to speak publicly, and did so on condition of anonymity.\n\nFarook had no criminal record and was not under scrutiny by local or federal law enforcement before the attack, authorities said. Friends knew him by his quick smile, his devotion to Islam and his talk about restoring cars.\n\nThey didn’t know he was busy with his wife building pipe bombs and stockpiling thousands of rounds of ammunition for the commando-style assault Wednesday on a gathering of Farook’s colleagues from San Bernardino County’s health department.\n\n“This was a person who was successful, who had a good job, a good income, a wife and a family. What was he missing in his life?” asked Nizaam Ali, who worshipped with Farook at a mosque in San Bernardino.\n\nAuthorities said that the couple sprayed as many as 75 rounds into the room before fleeing and had more than 1,600 rounds left when they were killed. At home, they had 12 pipe bombs, tools to make more explosives and well over 4,500 rounds, police said.\n\nOn Friday morning, the owner opened their rental townhome to reporters. On a living room table was a copy of the Quran. An upstairs bedroom had a crib, boxes of diapers and a computer. The couple had a 6-month-old child.\n\nThe dead ranged in age from 26 to 60.

In one, Farook describes himself as a "health, safety and environmental inspector," says he\'s 6\'0" tall and doesn\'t drink or smoke.\n\nAt that time the profile was made about six years ago, Farook claimed he was part of a “religios but modern family of 4” [sic] and that he enjoyed “doing target practice with younger sister and friends” in his back yard. He says he was born in Chicago, but in another profile indicated a Pakistani heritage.\n\nAnother profile portrayed a man trying to balance his faith and modern life.\n\n“I try to live as a good Muslim,” Farook writes. “Looking for a girl who has the same outlook, wear hijab, but live the life to the fullest."\n\nOn the same page, Farook, who graduated in 2010 from Cal State San Bernardino, preaches his love of snowboarding, camping, and working on cars, and further describes his personality as cautious, reserved, skeptical and very liberal.\n\nMustafa Kuko, who is the Director of the Islamic Center in Riverdale, Calif., where Farook worshiped until January 2014, said he was “withdrawn a bit” and didn’t “mix with people easily.”\n\nThere was never any sign of violent thoughts, Kuko said. “We talked about general issues whenever he talked to me,” he said.\n\nABC News also found several profiles that appeared to belong to Farook posted by his parents, eager to find their son a bride.\n\nOne profile, which was registered “to find my son/daughter a partner” [sic] list Farook as “very religious,” “Athletic,” and wanting to marry within the next year. Another gave Farook’s address, and claimed he had a Masters in Engineering. Both profiles described the shooter as “calm cool and thoughtful”.\n\nAccording to Farook\'s brother-in-law, Farhan Khan, Farook had recently found success in a relationship with a 29-year-old named Tashfeen Malik -- a woman police later said was his accomplice in the deadly shooting.\n\nWhile it\'s unclear how Farook and Malik met, a U.S. official said he left the U.S. in July 2014 and returned just a few days later, apparently with Malik in tow. Malik entered the U.S. on a Pakistani passport and a K-1 "Fiance" Visa. She and Farook were married the next month but it wasn\'t until this summer that Malik received her Green Card.\n\nSix months ago the young couple had a baby, but the day of the shooting, they left it with a family member and told the relative that they had doctor appointments, Hussam Ayloush, the executive director of the Muslim rights group CAIR, told ABC News. CAIR officials had appeared with Khan when he made his emotional announcement late Wednesday.\n\nA witness to Wednesday\'s shooting, local official Chris Nwadike, told ABC News Wednesday that he happened to be sitting at the same table as Farook earlier that day at the gathering at the Inland Regional Center. Farook left the meeting and disappeared for about half an hour, before apparently showing back up with Malik and several powerful weapons.\n\n"When I heard that name pop up, I couldn\'t believe it," Nwadike said of Farook. Nwadike happened to have gone to the bathroom when the shooting started.\n\nToday police in San Bernardino said that Farook did not appear to have a criminal record prior to the attack. The four weapons used in the shooting, two “long guns” and two handguns, were purchased legally, but the two long guns, also described by authorities as “assault weapons,” were not purchased by Farook, authorities said. A dozen explosive devices were also found at Farook\'s home.\n\nSan Bernardino County Sheriffs Office\n\nInvestigators believe that over several years Farook had been in some sort of contact with several people who were on the FBI’s radar for potential terrorism concerns, according to sources, but the people were, as one source said, “not significant FBI targets.”\n\nKhan told reporters late Wednesday he didn\'t understand why his brother-in-law would do it.\n\n"I have no idea... why he would do something like this," a visibly shocked Khan said.

An officer was also injured, but the injury was non-life threatening.Officials said Farook and Malik were dressed in assault style clothing and had assault rifles.The ATF said two rifles and two handguns were recovered in their investigation and officials are working to trace the serial numbers on the weapons.Officers swarmed a neighborhood about a mile from the SUV shootout, apparently in a hunt for a possible third gunman.A person seen running from the scene was detained, police confirmed. Officials would not call the person the third suspect, but just a person of interest.Police said later Wednesday evening that they now have reason to believe that Farook and Malik were the only shooters involved.Officers also searched a home several miles away in Redlands, which officials said was connected to Farook and Malik.Around 11 a.m., a shooting was reported at the Inland Regional Center, a nonprofit that works with individuals with developmental disabilities, at 1365 S. Waterman Avenue. The complex is comprised of three buildings.The attack took place in a conference area where the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health was holding a banquet, said Maybeth Field, president and CEO of the social services center. She said the building houses at least 25 employees as well as a library and conference center.Police confirmed Farook was an environmental specialist for the department of public health and had worked with the county for five years.Farook attended the banquet, but left early when he became angry, and according to police, the shooting followed shortly after."They came prepared to do what they did, as if they were on a mission," San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said.No weapons were recovered at the center, though authorities were investigating unidentified items in the building and have brought in bomb squads, Burguan said.Authorities said one device in the Inland Regional Center was believed to be an explosive, but federal law enforcement officials said it was later determined to be simply a piece of pipe.Loma Linda Hospital officials said five people wounded in the shooting were in their care. They confirmed two were in critical but stable condition, two others were in fair condition and the remaining person\'s condition was not available.Inland Regional Center employee Brandon Hunt told Eyewitness News that the auditorium is regularly rented out to outside agencies.

He said a shooter entered the building next to his wife\'s office and opened fire."They locked themselves in her office. They seen bodies on the floor," Aguilera said, adding that his wife saw ambulances taking people out of the building on stretchers.Aguilera said his wife was able to get out of the building unharmed.Terry Pettit said he received a text message from his daughter, telling him that gunmen were in her building and that she and some co-workers were hiding.Multiple agencies were working together on scene.

A second suspect was believed to be inside the vehicle, either dead or seriously wounded but with an automatic weapon strapped to his chest.\n\nA third suspect managed to flee into a neighborhood, and as of late afternoon, police and sheriff’s deputies were going house-to-house in a massive containment area.\n\nAgents from the Los Angeles field office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were at the scene of the morning shooting, according to the federal agency. Officials from the FBI were also dispatched.\n\n“We are confirming that we are responding to assist San Bernardino authorities who have the lead on the investigation,” according to Laura Eimiller of the FBI.\n\nAgents from Homeland Security Investigations also responded.\n\nPresident Barack Obama was briefed on the shooting. Gov. Jerry Brown was also briefed and “is closely monitoring this disturbing and ongoing situation unfolding in San Bernardino,” according to the governor’s Twitter page.\n\nThe city of Los Angeles Emergency Operations Center was activated “out of an abundance of caution” to monitor the situation, but city officials said there are “no known impacts from the shooting in the city.\n\n“Our police and fire agencies are in contact with their counterparts in San Bernardino and are on standby to assist as needed,” Mayor Eric Garcetti said. “In addition, my Mayor’s Office Crisis Response Team, trained in trauma intervention and grief counseling, has offered its support to San Bernardino — with a team of volunteers being made available to assist law enforcement agencies with outreach to affected family members, friends and the community.”\n\nAccording to the facility’s Facebook page, the Inland Regional Center has nearly 670 staff members and provides services to more than 30,200 people with developmental disabilities and their families in San Bernardino and Riverside counties.\n\n“As an agency among agencies, Inland Regional Center coordinates with generic services to normalize the lives of people with developmental disabilities and their families by working to include them in the everyday routines and life rhythms of the community and by facilitating needed supports for them,” according to the center’s Facebook page.\n\nAs the shooting investigation unfolded, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department issued a reminder that people can take steps to try to protect themselves in an active-shooter situation.

A third person seen running from the scene was detained, but police said it was unclear if he was connected to the shooting.\n\nWith both principal suspects dead, the motives and reasons for the rampage, the deadliest mass shooting in the United States since the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012, remain unclear. Police sources told the New York Times late Wednesday that the names of the victims were not being released. By Thursday morning, however, a portrait began to emerge of the shooters.\n\nFarook and Malik were a married couple in their 20s. Farook, 28, and Malik, 27, wed two years ago, a family relative told the Los Angeles Times. Farook, who is a U.S. citizen, was also an employee of the local county health department, which was hosting a holiday party at the Inland Regional Center when the attack took place, CNN reported. They had a 6-month-old daughter who was left in the care of her grandmother during the attack.\n\nFederal sources told the Los Angeles Times that Farook attended the party shortly before the shooting and reportedly stormed out after an altercation. When he returned, he and his wife were clad in masks in military-style armor. The pair came armed with handguns and rifles — two were purchased by the alleged shooters; all were legally obtained, according to CNN.\n\nDamian Dovarganes/AP Police on the scene in San Bernardino\n\nFarook was "very religious:" While no motive has been established, Farook\'s father said his son was devout. "He would go to work, come back, go to pray, come back. He\'s Muslim," he told the New York Daily News. There remains, however, no indication that religious extremism played a role in the attack.\n\nThose who knew Farook expressed shock as details emerged. He is not known to have any prior criminal record. "I would say \'hi\' and \'bye.\' But we never engaged him in conversation. He didn\'t say much at all," Griselda Reisinger, a former co-worker, told the Los Angeles Times. At a news conference from a California chapter of the Council on American Islamic Relations, Farook\'s brother-in-law, Farhan Khan, had no answers.\n\n"I have no idea why he would do something like this," he told reporters. "I have absolutely no idea. I am in shock myself."\n\nLingering questions: With Farook and Malik now deceased, it remains for everyone else to piece together why and how the attack went down. It is unclear whether the shooting was an act of religiously or politically motivated terrorism, or stemmed from a grudge Farook held against his employer, or something else entirely. The armor and collection of weaponry involved appears to indicate that the attack was planned rather than spontaneous, but that too is only speculation.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nDec. 3, 2015, 12:51 p.m.: This story has been updated to reflect the confirmed number of people injured in Wednesday\'s shooting in San Bernardino, California.', 'title': "Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik: Here's What We Know About San Bernardino Suspects", 'url': 'https://mic.com/articles/129607/syed-rizwan-farook-and-tashfeen-malik-here-s-what-we-know-about-san-bernardino-suspects#.Fi09AbQru', 'keywords': ['shooting', 'unclear', 'told', 'syed', 'know', 'bernardino', 'farook', 'suspects', 'tashfeen', 'rizwan', 'malik', 'heres', 'california', 'times', 'dead', 'los', 'san'], 'tags': {'Legal', 'Company News'}, 'summary': "Farook and Malik were a married couple in their 20s.\nFarook, 28, and Malik, 27, wed two years ago, a family relative told the Los Angeles Times.\nFederal sources told the Los Angeles Times that Farook attended the party shortly before the shooting and reportedly stormed out after an altercation.\nLingering questions: With Farook and Malik now deceased, it remains for everyone else to piece together why and how the attack went down.\nDec. 3, 2015, 12:51 p.m.: This story has been updated to reflect the confirmed number of people injured in Wednesday's shooting in San Bernardino, California.", 'date': 1449150381}, {'text': 'Relatives have described hearing from loved ones from inside a social services facility in San Bernardino, California, where police are responding to an active shooter.\n\nSeveral law enforcement agencies converged on the scene, and triage units were being set up in the area.\n\nTerry Pettit, the father of a witness inside the building\n\nTerry Pettit, the father of a witness inside building said: "Our daughter\'s in there.

She entered the United States on a K-1, or "fiancée," visa, meaning the couple had to marry within 90 days of her arrival.\n\nInvestigators are trying to determine whether Malik radicalized her husband. He had been different ever since he returned from meeting her in Saudi Arabia, Christian Nwadike, who worked with Farook for five years, told CBS.\n\n"I think he married a terrorist," Nwadike said.\n\nInvestigators are also looking into an argument between Farook and a coworker who is reported to have denounced the "inherent dangers of Islam," a US government source told Reuters.\n\nThe couple destroyed computer hard drives and other electronic devices before the shooting, the source added. Investigators are still hoping to recover information from the couple\'s computers and cell phones that will reveal whether they had browsed jihadist websites, or had contact with militant groups, before the attack at the Inland Regional Center on Wednesday.\n\nFarook had several profiles on Muslim-oriented dating sites, ABC News reported. In one, he described himself as part of a “religios [sic] but modern family of 4” who enjoyed “doing target practice with younger sister and friends” in his backyard.\n\n“I try to live as a good Muslim,” Farook wrote in another. “Looking for a girl who has the same outlook, wear hijab, but live the life to the fullest."\n\nBoth devout Muslims, Farook and Malik met online in 2014. The couple married on August 16 in Riverside, according to a marriage certificate obtained by ABC News. According to the LA Times, the two also had a marriage ceremony in Mecca, the holy city of Islam, in 2014.\n\nThey had a six-month-old daughter, police said. The baby was staying with Farook’s mother during the shooting.\n\nFarook\'s brother-in-law, Farhan Khan, told NBC News he had begun legal proceedings to adopt the girl and was "very upset and angry" at Farook for the massacre.\n\n"You left your 6-month-old daughter," Khan said. "In this life, some people cannot have kids. God gave you a gift of a daughter. And you left that kid behind... What did you achieve?"\n\nMalik was from the Layyah district in Pakistan’s southern Punjab province, but her family moved to Saudi Arabia about 25 years ago, two Pakistani officials told Reuters. She returned home “five or six years ago” to complete a degree in pharmacy from Bahauddin Zakariya University in Multan.\n\nHer father had become considerably more conservative since moving to Saudi Arabia, Malik’s uncle Javed Rabbani told Reuters, adding that Pakistani intelligence officials had contacted him as part of the investigation.\n\n"I only found out about this tragedy today when some intelligence officials contacted me to ask me about my links with Tashfeen," Rabbani said. "I had heard in the news that this tragedy had taken place but I could never even imagine that it would be someone from my family. Of course, we are in shock."\n\nAccording to the LA Times, Malik\'s family is from a part of Pakistan, in the Punjab province, where Islamic extremists have a significant presence.

Other media outlets have reported the suspect\'s name as being spelled Sayeed Farouk.\n\nThe 28-year-old man, an American citizen, was accompanied by a woman police identified as Tashfeen Malik, 27. Police initially said they weren\'t sure if the couple was engaged or already married but family members later confirmed they had been wed for two years. The couple is believed to be the parents of a six-month old baby girl who was reportedly staying with grandparents at the time of the attacks.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported Farook met Malik online. She was living in Saudi Arabia at the time. It\'s not clear if Malik was a U.S. citizen or not.\n\nCNN reports Farook had an online dating profile that listed his interests as working on vintage cars, reading religious books and eating out. He also said he liked traveling "and just hanging out in the back yard doing target practice with his younger sister and friends."\n\nPolice had earlier announced that two suspects, a man and a woman, were dead following a car chase that began at a neighboring apartment complex. Police have also searched a home that is believed to be owned by Farook.\n\nPolice Chief Jarrod Burguan said Farook and Malik were killed in the gunfight with police. At the time of their death, the suspects were armed with assault rifles and semi-automatic handguns. Investigators said they also discovered three explosive devices left at the scene of the attack.\n\nBurguan said police originally believed there were three suspects but believe now there were only two, adding "there had to be some sort of planning that went into this."\n\nThe suspects in yesterday\'s attack were dressed in dark clothing and wore tactical gear. Two handguns recovered at the scene were traced back to Farook who purchased them legally three or four years ago, officials said. Two rifled recovered at the scene were traced back to a former roommate of Farook\'s. Those guns were also purchased legally.\n\nThe shooters also left behind a bag with packed with explosive devices that were rigged to a remote controlled car. The remote for the car was found inside the SUV where Farook and Malik were killed. Police later disabled the explosives.\n\nA man who identified himself as Farook\'s father told the Daily News his son is married and has a son and worked as a health technician inspecting restaurants and hotels for the San Bernadino County Health Department. He was an American citizen and, according to the information his father provided to the Daily News, was "very religious."\n\n"He would go to work, come back, go to pray, come back. He\'s Muslim," the man, who was not named, said.\n\nThe Daily Beast reports Farook was a 2003 graduate La Sierra High School in California and most recently studied finance at California State University Fullerton until 2013. In a late-night press conference Wednesday night, police said Farook had worked for the county for five years.\n\nFarook\'s family expressed shock over his actions.\n\n"I cannot express how sad I am for what happened today," Farhan Kahn, Farook\'s brother-in-law, said during a Wednesday night press conference held by the Council on America-Islamic Relations. "We are very sad that people lost their lives.

The gunman's parents have since separated.\n\nSpeaking outside his Californian home, Mr Farook claimed that his son, who died along with his Pakistani-born wife Malik on Wednesday after killing 14 and injuring 21, rarely went to parties with her because he thought no other man should see her dancing.\n\nSenior law enforcement officials said on Sunday that it is not yet confirmed that it was specifically the terror group ISIS that played a significant role in Farook and Malik's radicalization, according to AOL.\n\n'We're not sure which one (fanatical ideology) they picked in this case, despite the media accounts,' Lynch said.\n\nRafia lived in the Redlands, California home with her son, Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik. Her license was found in the apartment by an MSNBC reporter earlier this week\n\nShe said after conducting 300 interviews, investigators 'do not have evidence that they were part of either a larger group or cell, or that they were planning anything else'.\n\nAnother official said that there is no direct evidence that terror groups overseas were in direct contact with the couple before the attack.\n\nIt was also revealed on Sunday that Rafia Farook is an active member of the Islamic Circle of North America, a Muslim organization that promotes Islam in the United States.\n\nThe group reportedly has ties to a radical Pakistani political group, Jamaat-e-Islami, according to the Daily Caller.\n\nA clearly distressed Mr Farook told the La Stampa that he believes his own life in America is over following the mass shooting.\n\nMr Farook added that he tried to argue with his son that opposition to Israel was best done with politics rather than weapons, and became angry with his son after seeing that he had acquired a gun.\n\nThe father also made a bizarre claim to the younger Farook that the Jewish state would not exist in two years because world powers such as the US, China and Russia did not want it and all of the Israelis would move to Ukraine.\n\nMr Farook said that he despaired at the choice his son had made and questioned why with a stable income, a new baby daughter and a seemingly happy marriage and life he appears to have become radicalized into militant Islam.\n\n'He said he shared the ideology of Al Baghdadi to create an Islamic state, and it was fixed with Israel,' said Mr Farook.\n\nThe father of San Bernardino gunman Syed Rizwan Farook, (left) 28, has revealed that his son said he supported the mission of ISIS before killing 14 people with his wife Tashfeen Malik (right)\n\nRafia lived in the above home with her son and her daughter-in-law, where the couple were building pipe bombs and storing thousands of rounds of ammunition\n\nHe said he did not know for sure if his son was in direct contact with jihadist fighters abroad or in the United States, but said, 'who knows, with the Internet and all that technology.'\n\nBeyond geopolitical issues leading Rizwan Farook towards extremism, Mr, Farook admitted his own family had been fracturing in recent years.\n\nRizwan Farook's mother Rafia, who lived with him, has previously said that her ex-husband is an alcoholic, mentally ill and hit her, according to the New York Times.\n\nMr Farook denied the allegations.\n\nThe couple's divorce was started in 2006 and finalized this year. Rafia Farook moved in with Rizwan last May and Mr Farook moved in with Raheel in September.\n\nMr Farook, who says he lived in a liberal Pakistani city before moving to the US and settling first in Chicago claimed that Rizwan was a momma's boy and that his son and his ex-wife shared a mutual devotion to their faith.\n\nHe said that his younger son had sided against him with Rafia, and that Rizwan had said his parents' marriage must end after an argument about Jesus Christ where the future gunman called his father an 'unbeliever'.\n\nThe 67-year-old said that he did not know whether his son had contact with terrorist suspects abroad, but said that it was possible with technology.\n\nHe also cleared up confusion regarding the family name Syed Farook, with public records seemingly stating that he had called two of his sons after himself.\n\nMr Farook blamed officials in Chicago and said that his sons were always named Rizwan and Raheel Farook respectively and not Syed.\n\nSyed Farook, 67, is the father of Syed Rizwan Farook - who gunned down 14 people along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik on Wednesday in San Bernardino, California. Mr Farook claimed his son was a mommy's boy, who obsessed over Israel's fate and supported the hateful ideology of ISIS\n\nInvestigators have begun to look for possible links to terrorist groups after Malik posted on Facebook during the attacks that she pledged allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nOfficials are also investigating possible contact with a member of Al Qaeda's Syrian outfit, the al-Nusra Front, and Malik's links to the radical Red Mosque in Pakistan.\n\nElsewhere yesterday, scores of mourners, including members of the Muslim community, visited a growing memorial on a corner near the social service center where the shooting took place.\n\nThere were American flags, a poster that read 'Pray for the world,' balloons, candles and cards. Many said they hoped the community would pull together.\n\n'I'm trying to use it as a teaching thing for myself and for my children that horrible things happen, but it doesn't mean that everybody is a horrible person,' said Eric Abrams, of San Bernardino.\n\nAt the St. Catherine of Siena Catholic Church, where shooting victim Yvette Velasco worshipped, the service focused on the need to get beyond the anger. Many parishioners said they would reach deep into their faith to find some way to forgive.\n\nMore than 100 people gathered for an interfaith memorial service at a mosque where Farook had occasionally prayed. Silver-framed photos of the victims were placed on a table at the Islamic Community Center of Redlands, with a candle lit for each.\n\nMuslim community members said they are feeling grief over the loss and fear of a backlash against their community. They encouraged community members to come together and not live in fear.\n\n'It is really sad that we meet because of this. It is sad that only in death are we able to celebrate humanity,' 30-year-old mosque member Ajarat Bada said, fighting back tears.\n\nMany in the crowd wrote personal notes to the victims' families that the mosque will deliver.", 'title': "FBI is investigating San Bernardino gunman Syed Farook's mother Rafia", 'url': 'http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3348741/FBI-investigating-San-Bernardino-gunman-s-mother-lived-terror-couple-knew-attack-advance.html', 'keywords': ['investigating', 'mr', 'syed', 'farooks', 'bernardino', 'farook', 'rizwan', 'malik', 'fbi', 'mother', 'community', 'father', 'rafia', 'son', 'gunman', 'san', 'lived'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'The older Farook at one time lived in Riverside, California with Rafia Farook, Tashfeen Malik, the younger Farook and his siblings.\nRafia lived in the Redlands, California home with her son, Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik.\nBeyond geopolitical issues leading Rizwan Farook towards extremism, Mr, Farook admitted his own family had been fracturing in recent years.\nRafia Farook moved in with Rizwan last May and Mr Farook moved in with Raheel in September.\nSyed Farook, 67, is the father of Syed Rizwan Farook - who gunned down 14 people along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik on Wednesday in San Bernardino, California.', 'date': 1449452660}, {'text': 'Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Add Interest\n\nThe photograph, taken from around the time of Malik’s college days in Pakistan between 2007 and 2012, is the second that has become public. Friday evening ABC News published the first, and in both the young woman has her hair covered and looks unsmiling into the camera.\n\nLaw enforcement officials told ABC News that while there is no hard evidence that Malik was the leader of a terrorist conspiracy, she is increasingly becoming the focus of investigators as the shooting’s possible “mastermind.” Her purported skill in wielding one of the assault-style weapons, for instance, led counter-terrorism analysts to assess that she “had some training.”\n\nInvestigators are also examining any possible digital footprint from the couple, attempting in part to determine if Farook had any social media connection to a known American ISIS recruiter named Mohamed Hasan who uses the online handle “Miski,” federal authorities said today. Originally from Minneapolis, Minn., the FBI fugitive is thought to be living overseas. He was previously linked to a failed ISIS-inspired plot in Texas this May.\n\nTashfeen Malik: Born in Pakistan, Grows Up in Saudi Arabia, Kills in America\n\nTashfeen Malik was born in Pakistan, but moved to Saudi Arabia when she was just four years old, according to an official close to the Saudi Arabian government. Overnight a family friend of the Maliks in Pakistan told ABC News her father, Gulzar Malik, was an engineer who spent most of his career in Saudi Arabia. He was known for helping the poor and building a mosque in his neighborhood, the family friend said. He was also an ultra-conservative Salafist Sunni who held strong anti-Shia views.\n\nTashfeen Malik moved back to Pakistan at least by 2007, attended Bahuddin Zakri University in Multan and stayed until 2012, according to a Pakistani intelligence official. She was said to be a brilliant student and was not known to have religious or political affiliation while there.\n\nWhen it comes to how Tashfeen Malik met Syed Rizwan Farook, her future U.S.-born husband and killer accomplice, the family friend provided new but conflicting information. Friday an attorney for Farook’s family said that the couple met on a dating website, a version of events that Malik purportedly gave to U.S. consular officials when applying for a visa in 2014, according to a U.S. government document obtained by ABC News. U.S. officials had said it’s possible the couple met in Saudi Arabia in 2013, but it’s certain that after Farook took a nine-day trip to Saudi Arabia in July 2014, he returned to the U.S. with Malik in tow. They were married in the eyes of U.S. law a month later.\n\nFBI, left, and California Department of Motor Vehicles via AP\n\nBut the family friend, who said he’s known the Malik family for years, said Malik and Farook were first connected by family, rather than the internet. He told ABC News that a relative of Farook’s father worked with Malik’s father and that Farook and Malik may have met as early as 2009.\n\nA step-aunt of Malik’s in Pakistan told The Associated Press she understood Malik had grown to be more zealous in her faith over the last three years, changing from western clothes to the hijab and more conservative burka. However, the woman also said she had never actually met Malik and that her immediate family and Malik’s were not on speaking terms. A professor at the college Malik attended until 2012 told The Washington Post he remembered her wearing a “complete veil” and being a “religious-minded student.”\n\nMalik came to the U.S. in 2014 on what is known as a “fiancé” visa, which allows an American fiancé to petition for his or her partner’s temporary entry before marriage. Malik received her Green Card this summer, U.S. officials said.\n\nSix months ago, the couple had a baby daughter and named her according to a naming convention more common to Arab families, rather than in the typical Pakistani manner.\n\nHow Malik purportedly became radicalized enough to post the alleged pledge of allegiance to ISIS and help kill more than a dozen people in a quiet California town is still a mystery.\n\nInvestigators are also still puzzling over Malik’s exact role ahead of the San Bernardino shooting -- whether she may have radicalized Farook, whether it was the other way around, or whether this was an act of radicalism at all.\n\n“I don’t know the answer, whether she influenced him or not. Being a husband myself, we’re all influenced to an extent. But I don’t know the answer,” FBI Special Agent David Bowdich told reporters Friday.\n\nIn addition to Malik’s suspected “training,” an online dating profiled set up by Farook years ago indicated he too had experience with firearms -- among his hobbies, he listed shooting "target practice."\n\nThe FBI announced Friday it was treating the investigation as one into an “act of terrorism,” but no official motive has been determined.\n\nAn official close to the Saudi Arabian government said that Saudi intelligence officials did not have Malik on any of their watch lists and she did not appear to have any link to extremists in the region. Neither Malik or Farook were on the FBI’s radar in the U.S., officials said.\n\nFriday lawyers for the Farook family cast doubt on the reports of the ISIS pledge and said that there hasn’t been any real evidence that the couple has any “extremist tendencies.”\n\n“None of the family knew of him as being extreme, aggressive or having any extreme religious views,” one of the attorneys said.\n\nThe other noted that Malik was very soft-spoken and conservative -- so much that Farook\'s brothers never saw her face, due to the full burqa she always wore in public.\n\nAs the FBI continues to investigate, Nada Bakos, a former CIA analyst, told ABC News she would not be surprised if Malik had been ISIS-inspired. “Terrorism is not gender-specific,” she said.\n\nA recent report by George Washington University’s Center for Cyber and Homeland Security said that of the 71 individuals arrested in the U.S. since March 2014 with purported ties to ISIS, 10 were female.\n\nBakos, whose work with the CIA concentrated on al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), the precursor to ISIS, told ABC News she often tracked female extremists for the Agency and noted that AQI infamously used a female suicide bomber in a failed suicide attack in Jordan in 2005 – the woman had hidden a bomb under her dress, but it failed to detonate.\n\n“Men don’t have a monopoly on terrorism or conducting violent acts,” she said. “At this point, in the evolution of terrorism, it wouldn’t be surprising to see a woman take an operational role.”\n\nMalik, 29, and Farook, 28, were killed Wednesday in a shootout with police less than two miles from the mass murders at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino. After news broke of Malik’s alleged pseudonymous pledge to ISIS’s leader, a media group affiliated with ISIS released audio and text statements hailing the two as “soldiers of the Caliphate” and “supporters,” but the terror group did not take responsibility for playing any operational role in the attack and today only mentioned it in the audio message as part of a kind of news roundup.\n\nABC News’ Justin Fishel contributed to this report.\n\n[Editor’s Note: An ABC News report on Tashfeen Malik published Friday said Malik provided a nonexistent address to U.S. officials when she applied for the fiancé visa. Local residents since said the version of the address provided is not precise but the family does own a house in the neighborhood.]', 'title': 'New Photo, Details Emerge About Woman Shooter in San Bernardino Killings', 'url': 'https://abcnews.go.com/International/photo-details-emerge-woman-shooter-san-bernardino-killings/story?id=35595264', 'keywords': ['told', 'abc', 'pakistan', 'bernardino', 'farook', 'killings', 'shooter', 'malik', 'maliks', 'family', 'details', 'officials', 'saudi', 'isis', 'emerge', 'woman', 'san'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Friday evening ABC News published the first, and in both the young woman has her hair covered and looks unsmiling into the camera.\nOvernight a family friend of the Maliks in Pakistan told ABC News her father, Gulzar Malik, was an engineer who spent most of his career in Saudi Arabia.\nHe told ABC News that a relative of Farook’s father worked with Malik’s father and that Farook and Malik may have met as early as 2009.\nHowever, the woman also said she had never actually met Malik and that her immediate family and Malik’s were not on speaking terms.\nAs the FBI continues to investigate, Nada Bakos, a former CIA analyst, told ABC News she would not be surprised if Malik had been ISIS-inspired.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'Is there anything left to say about America’s self-destructive passion for firearms? Perhaps this. From a theoretical point of view, we are faced with a classic collective-action problem. Clearly, it would be in everybody’s interest if there were far fewer guns out there, especially fewer of the military-style weapons that also lend themselves to the massacre of civilians—as we discovered yet again on Wednesday, when, according to officials, a twenty-eight-year-old man, Syed Farook, and a twenty-seven-year-old woman, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire at an office party in San Bernardino, California, killing at least fourteen people and injuring seventeen. But since there are already an estimated three hundred million guns in private hands (nobody knows the exact number) and U.S. gun laws are so lax, many Americans believe that they need a weapon, or many weapons, to defend themselves and their families.\n\nWith reports emerging that Farook and Malik may have had ties to radical Islamism, these concerns are going to be exacerbated. In a different country, a winning argument could be made that the threat of homegrown terrorism is another powerful reason for restricting the sale and circulation of deadly firearms. Here in the U.S., the mere mention of the “T” word, by making Americans even more fearful and providing more fodder for the gun lobby, is likely only to exacerbate the underlying problem.\n\nThe night before the shooting started in San Bernardino, the Associated Press reported that, based on background-check statistics, gun sales soared on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving. Within twenty-four hours, the F.B.I. said, it ran more than a hundred and eighty-five thousand background checks, which are required for purchases from licensed firearms dealers. (There isn’t a precise one-to-one correlation between background checks and gun sales, but they generally go together.)\n\nThe surge on Black Friday may have been, in part, a reaction to the terrorist attacks that took place in Paris in mid-November. But it wasn’t a one-off thing: gun sales have been rising all year. In October, which began with a mass shooting in which a student at Umpqua Community College, in Oregon, killed nine people, the F.B.I. carried out almost two million background checks. So far this year, it has carried out almost twenty million.\n\nFor citizens of such a rich and (hitherto) stable country to be arming themselves at this rate is collective insanity. And it’s not just the citizenry that is gearing up. At one point during its live coverage of the shootings in San Bernardino, CNN showed two big armored vehicles next to the black S.U.V. in which the suspects had reportedly escaped, before they were killed in a shootout with police. Wolf Blitzer, the veteran anchorman, noted that he’d seen those types of vehicles before—in Fallujah, Iraq. Then, worried that the S.U.V. might have been booby trapped, the police used a robot to approach the vehicle which resembled the ones featured in “The Hurt Locker,” the Oscar-winning movie about a bomb-disposal team in Iraq.\n\nThis, tragically, is the country we inhabit. Confronted with daily mass shootings and widespread fears of more terrorist attacks, the United States has turned its police departments, or parts of them, into paramilitary forces equipped with weapons, vehicles, and other devices designed for fighting wars. In all probability, the horrific events in San Bernardino—and, last week, in Colorado Springs, where Robert Lewis Dear, Jr., a fifty-seven-year-old man, allegedly killed three people at a Planned Parenthood facility and fired on police officers before being apprehended—will accentuate the trend. Seeing cops in two states under fire from heavily armed shooters, many police chiefs around the country will conclude that they, too, need more firepower. And given the deadly arsenals that alienated private citizens, whatever their precise motivations, can readily assemble, it will be hard to counter this argument.\n\nWhat would it take to break this cycle of violence and militarization?\n\nTo counter domestic terrorism of all varieties, surveillance and police work are obviously key. But the broader issue of firearms proliferation cannot be avoided. Generally speaking, there are two ways to tackle collective-action problems: through government regulation and in the establishment of social norms. Ideally, both come into play and reinforce each other. In Britain, for example, firearms laws have always been strict, and, outside of a few rural areas where hunting is popular, owning a gun is often seen as strange and anti-social. Owning an assault weapon is illegal. Anybody who suggested changing the law would be treated as a pariah.\n\nIn the United States, sadly, the political system is paralyzed, and in many parts of the country social norms are skewed in favor of gun ownership. Far from regarding strict regulation as a potential solution to a serious problem, many gun owners regard it as a potential threat to their own liberty and safety. Thanks to the organized clout of the gun lobby and the manner in which the constitution gives small states outsized political power, these views command a veto over policy. Even modest measures that have majority support in the polls, such as expanding background checks and reinstating the assault-weapons ban that Bill Clinton passed in 1994 (it expired in 2004), are widely seen in Washington as non-starters.\n\nIn this context, the question of whether Farook, Malik, and Dear are to be categorized as terrorists is a secondary issue.

a California health inspector and US citizen - dropped off his six-month-old baby with his mother, saying he was going to a doctor's appointment.\n\nBy noon, according to police, the couple had donned assault clothing, armed themselves with rifles and stormed a holiday party attended by Farook's San Bernardino County co-workers, killing 14 people and wounding 17 others.\n\nThose who knew Farook, among them his colleagues at the San Bernardino County Public Health Department, described him as a devout Muslim but not someone who often talked about religion.\n\nA police officer who was the first to engage with the suspects was hurt in the gun battle and is in hospital with non life-threatening injuries\n\nThe SUV was captured on broadcast helicopters with its windows apparently completely shot out and a smashed windscreen\n\nA source told CNN that the suspects threw pipe bombs out of the windows of the vehicle before the shootout with police\n\nThe section of road where the SUV was stopped remained cordoned off this evening as police continued their investigation\n\nPolice urged residents in the area south of San Bernardino Avenue and west of Mountain View to shelter with their doors and windows locked and secure while police activity (pictured) continued\n\n'He never struck me as a fanatic, he never struck me as suspicious,' said Griselda Reisinger, a former colleague.\n\nCo-worker Patrick Baccari, who shared a cubicle with Farook, told the Los Angeles Times he and his young family appeared to be 'living the American dream.'\n\nFarook's family was originally from South Asia, while Malik was believed to be from Pakistan and had lived in Saudi Arabia before coming to the United States, said Hussam Ayloush, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). Farook had an older brother, he added, who had served in the US military.\n\nThe gunman's father, also named Syed Farook, seemed shocked when talking to the New York Daily News after the shooting.\n\n“I haven’t heard anything,' the elder Mr Farook said before his son’s name became public. 'He was very religious. He would go to work, come back, go to pray, come back. He’s Muslim.'\n\nPublic records suggest possible turbulence in Farook's younger life.\n\nIn 2006, Rafia Farook, who records indicate is Farook's mother, filed in a Riverside court for divorce from her husband, the elder Mr Farook.\n\nShe enumerated multiple instances of domestic abuse in the legal filing, and said her husband 'threatens to kill himself on a daily basis.' During one incident, she said in a court filing, her son came between them 'to save me.'\n\nIn the hours after the shooting, more information emerged about Farook, who was born in the US, and Malik, whom is he thought to have met and married in Saudi Arabia before bringing him home to Redlands, California with him.\n\nIn an online profile reportedly created by Farook and his parents six years ago on a Muslim dating site, the health inspector described himself as 6-foot-tall and said he didn't drink or smoke, according to ABC News.\n\nFarook wrote that he was part of a 'religios [sic] but modern family of 4' and that he enjoyed 'doing target practice with younger sister and friends' in their backyard.\n\nOn another dating site, Farook allegedly shared his thoughts on living a balanced life as a Muslim-American: 'I try to live as a good Muslim. Looking for a girl who has the same outlook, wear hijab, but live the life to the fullest.'\n\nSan Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said that Farook was 'angry' when he left the party, before returning with Malik and a stash of heavy weapons.

Earlier this year they threw a baby shower for him and his partner, Tashfeen Malik.\n\nBut on Thursday, with 14 victims in the morgue and 21 wounded, and police sifting through an arsenal of ammunition and apparent bomb-making equipment at the couple’s home, it was clear something had gone terribly wrong.\n\nBut what?\n\n“We still don’t have a motive,” the city’s police chief, Jarrod Burguan, told a news conference.\n\nHowever, pieces of the puzzle, indicating a possible mix of personal and ideological motives, did begin to emerge.\n\nLaw enforcement sources told CNN that Farook, who was born in Illinois but had Pakistani heritage, was in touch with people being investigated by the FBI for international terrorism. This could not be independently verified by the Guardian.\n\nUntil Wednesday’s atrocity, neither he nor Malik was known to the FBI or on a list of potentially radicalised people. Investigators poring through his records said Farook communicated by phone and via social media with more than one person being investigated for terrorism, said CNN, citing law enforcement officials.\n\n\n\nThe second red flag was that he had encountered possible problems at work. Some witnesses said Farook left early from the Christmas luncheon party at the Inland Regional Center after an angry altercation. “There was some type of dispute,” Burguan said.\n\nHowever, that does not account for the preparation for the assault: black tactical-style clothing; assault rifles, handguns, pipe bombs; and a remote-controlled explosive device placed in the black SUV the couple had rented several days earlier.\n\nGriselda Reisinger, a colleague who left the department several months ago, told the LA Times there was a fraught atmosphere at work, with many workers unhappy with management.\n\nThe motives of anyone who plans a mass shooting are necessarily murky and complex. But the actions of Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik seem more incomprehensible still.\n\nIn one of the most jarring details to emerge in the aftermath of the shooting, it is now known that the couple, who died in a gunfight with police, began their day by leaving their six-month-old daughter with Farook’s mother.\n\nSyed Rizwan Farook Photograph: iMilap.com\n\nHussam Ayloush, who heads the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Los Angeles, said Farook, 28, and Malik, 27, said they were going to a doctor’s appointment. Farook’s mother became worried when she heard reports about the shooting and tried to call the couple without success.\n\nAyloush helped organise an impromptu press conference by Farook’s brother-in-law, Farhan Khan, who told reporters he was utterly baffled at what had happened. “I have no idea why would he do that,” Khan said. “I have absolutely no idea. I am in shock myself.”\n\n\n\nSpeaking to CNN, Ayloush said Farook’s family told him they “had no clue that this could happen”. He said: “The suspect is married, has a six-month-old baby. They have no reason [about] what made him snap. Was it workplace related? Is it mental illness? Is it some twisted ideology? It is really unknown to us. All they [the family] can do is share with everybody sorrow and prayers.”\n\nAyloush added: “The family is devastated, like all Americans. This is the time for us to express solidarity among all of us Americans in rejecting whatever the motives might have been. There is absolutely no justification for such horrendous behaviour.”\n\nSan Bernardino: couple die in police gun battle after mass shooting Read more\n\nFarook, it emerged, had a passion for guns. In a badly spelled dating profile on the site iMilap.com published about six years ago he mentioned several hobbies, including shooting.\n\n“Enjoy working on vintage and modern cars, read religios books, enjoy eating out sometimes travel and just hang out in back yard doing target pratice with younger sister and friends.”\n\nBut before Wednesday, the couple appeared utterly ordinary to those who knew them. Farook had worked at the county health department for five years, with online records indicating he earned about $70,000 (£46,000) a year. He is listed online as an environmental health specialist for San Bernardino County and is believed to have lived locally. He recently wrote an inspection report on a Mexican restaurant in Rialto.\n\nWhile police said they were unsure whether the pair were engaged or married, reports said they had been married for two years.\n\nFarook visited Saudi Arabia for several weeks in 2013 on the hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca that Muslims are required to take at least once in their lifetime. During the trip he met Malik, a native of Pakistan. Said to be a pharmacist, she reportedly came to the United States on a “fiancee visa” and became a lawful permanent resident.\n\nPatrick Baccari, a fellow health inspector who shared a cubicle with Farook, told the LA Times that the couple appeared to be “living the American dream”.\n\nFarook graduated from California State University with a degree in environmental health in 2009, Heavy reports.\n\nAccording to court filings, Farook and his siblings sometimes found themselves caught in the middle of violent domestic disputes involving his mother, Rafia, and his 66-year-old father, also named Syed. Rafia filed for legal separation in 2008.\n\nCourt filings in 2006 and 2008 show that Rafia filed restraining orders against the elder Syed, describing him as a mentally ill, unstable alcoholic on medication who “threatens to kill himself on a daily basis”. She requested he be ordered to stay away from the family home in Riverside, about a half-hour drive south of the shooting scene in San Bernardino.\n\nThe filings allege that the children witnessed several violent episodes. In one incident in February 2008, she claimed: “Syed had a fight with my son and me and he got drunk. I called at 6am to his brother in Chicago and I said he threatening to kill himself [sic]. His brother called the police from Chicago and the police was at my house at 5am and they put him in the county hospital for 72 hours observation.” It was unclear which brother this referred to.\n\nThe elder Farook lived with the shooter’s brother, a business taxes representative for the California state board of equalization, in Corona, 30 miles south of San Bernardino.', 'title': "San Bernardino shooting suspects raised few red flags before 'horrendous' crime", 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/03/san-bernadino-shooting-suspects-syed-rizwan-farook-tashfeen-malik', 'keywords': ['shooting', 'health', 'told', 'couple', 'raised', 'syed', 'bernardino', 'farook', 'suspects', 'flags', 'rizwan', 'malik', 'horrendous', 'red', 'crime', 'san'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'San Bernardino shooting: 14 victims named by police – latest updates Read moreHe had no criminal record, no known ties to religious or political radicalism.\nColleagues at the San Bernardino County public health department said Farook was quiet and polite.\nBut the actions of Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik seem more incomprehensible still.\nHe is listed online as an environmental health specialist for San Bernardino County and is believed to have lived locally.\nShe requested he be ordered to stay away from the family home in Riverside, about a half-hour drive south of the shooting scene in San Bernardino.', 'date': 1449100800}]
