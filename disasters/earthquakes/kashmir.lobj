[{'text': 'The jihadi-led aid efforts after the cataclysmic Kashmir earthquake expose deep fractures in Pakistani politics, reports Jan McGirk.\n\nThey say that not even a single leaf on a tree can shake in Pakistan without the army and its dreaded intelligence service, the ISI, knowing about it. So when on the morning of 8 October 2005 a 7.6 magnitude earthquake, the most devastating in a century, collapsed buildings and triggered violent landsides that left nearly 3 million people homeless in Kashmir and the Northwest Frontier Province, Pakistanis were aghast that soldiers did not come immediately to their rescue.\n\nAlso by Jan McGirk in openDemocracy: \x93Bambi vs Godzilla in Thailand\x94 (April 2005) \x93Bali\x92s message of dialogue\x94 (August 2005) \x93Bali\x92s agony, Thailand\x92s turmoil\x94 (October 2005) If you find this material valuable please consider supporting openDemocracy by sending us a donation so that we can continue our work and keep it free for all\n\nNearly a quarter of a million troops were already stationed in the area, to enforce a tentative ceasefire with Pakistan\x92s nuclear-armed neighbour, India, over claims to the disputed territory. After living under the military dictatorship of General Pervez Musharraf for six years, the victims expected a disciplined and professional relief effort to alleviate their suffering.\n\n"Musharraf is a great man\x94, said Umar Khan, a baggage porter in Lahore who was wheeling medical supplies towards the airport customs counter on the evening of 9 October, just thirty-seven hours after the monster tremors ripped through the Himalayas. "He will get this job done, because he is not corrupt." Musharraf\'s pragmatism, which has spurred Pakistan\'s economic growth, had been widely admired in a society more accustomed to kleptocrats and their cronies. But then the earth moved.\n\nIt took days before the army would reach any stricken areas beyond the towns; while it dallied, tens of thousands of loved ones were smothered under the rubble and the injuries of survivors went septic. Without any shelter, vulnerable infants and elders contracted pneumonia when intermittent downpours soaked their bedding. In grief, people could only cling to one another for body heat as hail pelted down and thunderclaps heralded more aftershocks. Villagers grumbled that the army must be tending to its own casualties first and had abandoned its hapless civilians to the elements.\n\nPakistan announced that more than 400 of its military personnel died in the tremors. In addition, reports that the quake killed a hundred militants in training camps established near the line of control (LoC) separating Pakistani- and Indian-administered Kashmir have been circulating; the government has never acknowledged that such camps exist, even though India has since 1989 accused Pakistan of arming and supporting Islamic guerrillas and demanded the camps\x92 closure.\n\nOther Kashmiris, displaced by shelling during two wars fought over the terrain, had been rehoused in squalid and cramped quarters which did not withstand the severe jolts. Faced with destruction on such a vast scale, Brigadier Sikander Javaid admitted that the army had to rely on survivors fit enough to walk down to their bases and inform them where aid was most needed. An estimated half-million quake victims are struggling to cope on their own.\n\n"We tried to wave the helicopters down, but they refused to land here", complained Sumair Ahmed, a tailor, after an aerial assessment team had hovered in a helicopter over his village on the edge of the Kaghan valley. "Are we not also part of Pakistan?"\n\nNow, eleven days afterwards, regional officials report a death toll of more than 79,000, and admit that 20% of the most remote villages are still cut off, in the upper valleys beyond the range of helicopters or pack mules. As well as destroying a 30,000 square-kilometre chunk of the Himalayas, the cataclysmic Kashmir earthquake has unearthed deep faultlines in the politics of Pakistan. General Musharraf went on television to apologise to the nation for unseemly delays, but irritatedly pointed out that his army was quicker off the mark than Washington\'s response to hurricane Katrina.\n\nParticularly in the strategic but underdeveloped areas near the Indian frontier, Pakistan\'s civil service has been gutted under Musharraf\'s rule, and no detailed plans for a disaster response existed. When the earthquake severed landlines and radio communications and mobile-phone systems were unable to cope, military officers became utterly paralysed. They were slow to act because they were waiting for top-down orders that never came.\n\nSamina Ahmed, Islamabad-based director of the International Crisis Group, observes: "In recent years there has been a disproportionate build-up of the army and a neglect of civilian concerns. The military lacks professional management skills. They are trained to fight wars. They can get boots on the ground but that\'s it."\n\nThe jihadi aid campaign\n\nMeanwhile, long before the arrival of army regulars, international aid agencies, or emergency search and rescue teams, an alternative volunteer army was reporting for duty in the earthquake zone: the jihadis. Bearded young men converged on towns close to the epicentre, after threading their shiny white mini-vans or military vehicles through boulder-strewn roads. More trekked by foot across rockslides, carrying picks and shovels. Yahya Mujahid, a Muslim militant chief, said he ordered his guerrillas to put aside their Kalashnikov rifles and hired 100 mules so they could get relief supplies up to the heights and carry out the injured.\n\nThe efforts won accolades from anguished survivors. No one else was on the spot to help locals unearth the injured and administer first aid, shroud and bury their dead, or dish up dates and hot soup so they might break the Ramadan fast at dusk. These aidworkers appeared extremely organised. In Muzaffarabad, a garrison city and the capital of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, a big banner was erected over a tarpaulin spread with prayer-mats and quilts. It identified the energetic do-gooders as Jammat-ud-Dawa. This group is known to be a spin-off of the banned religious militants, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and is widely seen as the fundraising and recruiting wing for Islamist warriors who cross into India.\n\nMusharraf, under pressure from the Americans, outlawed Lashkar as a terrorist organisation in 2002 because of its links to al-Qaida. The name change has allowed Jammat-ud-Dawa to continue building its religious seminaries, to train preachers for mosques, and dispense medical care to the indigent. But will they be able to muster support and force their way onto the national political agenda?\n\nThere are parallels with Palestine and Egypt, where religious groups took up the initiative wherever the government fell short in its performance. Washington\'s financial crackdown on Islamic charities following the World Trade Center attacks on 9/11 means that donations from abroad have been languishing, collecting interest in western banks, before essential transfers could be made to help victims in Pakistan. Local Muslim charities did not face such restrictions.', 'title': 'Kashmir: the politics of an earthquake', 'url': 'https://www.opendemocracy.net/conflict-india_pakistan/jihadi_2941.jsp', 'keywords': ['army', 'kashmir', 'pakistan', 'military', 'aid', 'victims', 'earthquake', 'politics', '2005', 'survivors', 'religious'], 'tags': {'india/pakistan', 'Democracy and government', 'conflicts', 'Conflict', 'asia & pacific'}, 'summary': "The jihadi-led aid efforts after the cataclysmic Kashmir earthquake expose deep fractures in Pakistani politics, reports Jan McGirk.\nMusharraf's pragmatism, which has spurred Pakistan's economic growth, had been widely admired in a society more accustomed to kleptocrats and their cronies.\nAs well as destroying a 30,000 square-kilometre chunk of the Himalayas, the cataclysmic Kashmir earthquake has unearthed deep faultlines in the politics of Pakistan.\nWhen the earthquake severed landlines and radio communications and mobile-phone systems were unable to cope, military officers became utterly paralysed.\nIn Muzaffarabad, a garrison city and the capital of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, a big banner was erected over a tarpaulin spread with prayer-mats and quilts.", 'date': None}, {'text': "More than 1,000 people are thought to have died, with reports of casualties still coming in.\n\nBBC correspondents in the region report on the impact of the earthquake.\n\nBarbara Plett: Islamabad, Pakistan : 1927GMT\n\nRescue workers here continued in driving rain as night fell, still trying to pull survivors out of a 10-storey apartment block that had collapsed into rubble.\n\nIn north-western Pakistan, the death toll climbed steadily. In particularly distressing news, local police officials said hundreds of children died when at least one school was destroyed.\n\nBut the worst-hit area was Pakistan-administered Kashmir. In the regional capital, Muzaffarabad, many buildings collapsed, including a courthouse. However an army spokesman said most of the damage was in mountainous areas where houses are made of mud bricks. He said whole villages had vanished.\n\nPrime Minister Shaukat Aziz has now called for international aid.\n\nBarbara Plett: Islamabad, Pakistan : 1625GMT\n\nIn Islamabad rescue workers are still trying to dig people out of the ruins of a collapsed apartment block. But even in this relatively well-serviced pocket of the capital, they are finding it hard to cope.\n\nPeople say the operation is unorganised and there isn't proper equipment. And the challenge is greater further north in Pakistan-administered Kashmir - the epicentre of the earthquake.\n\nMany houses in the mountains are made of mud. An army spokesman said villages had collapsed and towns had vanished. Army helicopters are needed to reach the afflicted. Roads have been blocked by mudslides. Telephone lines are down.\n\nThis is the test President Musharraf has set his forces, but as they face one of Pakistan's worst natural disasters, it is not clear if they can meet it.\n\nZaffar Abbas : near Muzaffarabad, Pakistan-administered Kashmir : 1615GMT\n\nWe have now made three attempts to go to Muzaffarabad from three different directions but have failed. All roads have been blocked by landslides. There are trees and big rocks on the road and its impossible to approach Muzaffarabad from any direction. We will soon be turning back but the situation is getting desperate.\n\nThousands of people have descended from the villages that have been virtually destroyed. They want to go to Muzaffarabad to take their injured to the city where there are medical facilities and hospitals but they have no way of approaching the city, or any other town for that matter.\n\nNavdip Dhariwhal : Delhi, India : 1502GMT\n\nThe quake's impact was felt across India. In Punjab, shops and houses collapsed and rescuers worked their way through rubble to find survivors. Its intensity was felt as far south as the capital Delhi, causing damage to buildings. And as far away as Gujarat, the tremors triggered widespread panic.\n\nBut the worst affected parts were the mountain towns bordering the Pakistani side of Kashmir. Stone and mud houses in remote villages were reduced to rubble. Many other homes were buried under landslides triggered by the quake. In one town it's feared two hundred people died but the casualties could be far greater.\n\nThe line dividing the two sides of Kashmir is heavily militarised. The Indian army too suffered casualties and the air force was brought in to help the rescue effort.\n\nZaffar Abbas : near Muzaffarabad, Pakistan-administered Kashmir : 1426GMT\n\nThe initial part of the journey from Islamabad was pretty smooth - there were little signs of any real damage.\n\nThe minute we became close to the city of Muzaffarabad the damage was evident. There were landslides all over the place, rocks on the road, a number of houses were damaged and relief work was going on mainly by the local villagers.\n\nWhere I'm standing now, about 20 kilometres from the city of Muzaffarabad, there's a huge landslide blocking the entire road. Hundreds of villagers are trying to clear the road but it looks like it may take them the whole night to get the job done. So from this end, the Pakistan-administered Kashmiri area is completely cut off from the rest of the country.\n\nBarbara Plett : Islamabad, Pakistan : 1340GMT\n\nIt's difficult to get around in the affected areas in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Landslides have blocked roads between Islamabad and the regional capital Muzaffarabad, so people can't bring in supplies. People also can't find out what's going on because the telephone lines are down, too.\n\nThe army has been put into commission - Pakistan has a military government so it's quite easy to deploy quickly. They have a crisis response unit and that has geared into action - sending helicopters with medical teams and the facilities to set up medical camps and over time, I suppose, bring in supplies to help people get their lives back together. But this isn't a team that has been trained specifically to deal with earthquake disasters.\n\nAltaf Hussain : Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir : 1310GMT\n\nThe authorities say about 200 people have been killed across the state. Thousands of houses have been damaged and 400 tents have been sent to the worst-affected areas. The Indian air force has been helping to evacuate the those who have been injured. The authorities say it's still to early to tell the exact magnitude of the damage as communication is difficult.\n\nAltaf Hussain : Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir : 1212GMT\n\nThe epicentre of the earthquake has been found in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, west of its capital, Muzaffarabad. Thousands of houses have been damaged, mostly in the border districts of Baramullah, Kupwara and Poonch.\n\nA fire broke out in a market in the border town of Uri after the earthquake. Almost all the shops have been damaged. The state's chief secretary told a press conference that relief work has begun in all the affected areas.\n\nThe army has also joined in the rescue operation. Hospitals have been geared up for receiving casualties and doctors on leave have been asked to resume duty immediately.\n\nThe administration is working overtime to restore essential supplies such as electricity and water, disrupted by the earthquake.\n\nHospitals have received hundreds of trauma cases. Many people are still staying out of their homes, fearing more tremors.\n\nRahimullah Yusufzai : Peshawar, Pakistan : 1158GMT\n\nThe first shock was very serious, we were all rocked and the whole place was shaking. I ran out of my home.\n\nIt continued for almost six minutes, it was very long. Since the first shock we have had a dozen after-shocks.\n\nWe keep coming back to our houses and then having to flee again. Some have decided not to return to their homes for now.\n\nBarbara Plett : Islamabad, Pakistan : 1123GMT\n\nThere was a tremor here in the last few minutes. The roof, where I was standing, felt like it was rolling beneath me. But it was a small aftershock.\n\nDriving around the streets in the past hour, it is calm here in the city, but the streets are empty.\n\nMany thought Islamabad was earthquake-proof, but that wasn't so, as an apartment block collapsed. If it caused that damage here, imagine what it did to homes made of mud in the remote villages.\n\nI think we will be hearing some very sad tales from those areas very soon.\n\nAltaf Hussain : Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir : 1111GMT\n\nThe numbers of deaths have been rising and now it is estimated at around 200. Thousands of houses are damaged, some destroyed, leaving some people homeless.\n\nFour hundred tents have arrived in Uri, but this is an insufficient number of tents, more are needed. Some field hospitals have been set up too.\n\nI'm told the Red Cross teams have now reached all the affected areas in Indian-administered Kashmir.\n\nThe army has offered full support.\n\nThe road to Tandgar was blocked by a massive landslide, but that has been cleared. There is no water supply in some areas, but engineers are now working to restore that.\n\nThere was another tremor here about 15 minutes ago, which caused some panic.\n\nRahimullah Yusufzai : Peshawar, Pakistan : 1056GMT\n\nMilitary spokesman Major General Shaukat Sultan told journalists that more than 1,000 people are feared killed.\n\nHe said Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the North-West Frontier Province, which borders Afghanistan, were the worst-hit.\n\nA senior police officer in Peshawar, the capital of the North-West Frontier province, told the BBC that initial reports put the number of those dead at 140.\n\nIn Baramulla, Kashmiri women and children weep following the quake\n\nThe operational police head, Malik Saad, said the toll would go up once information from the remote areas trickles in.\n\nHe said more than 100 people were killed in the northern district of Battagram after a their houses collapsed in the tremors.\n\nHe said another 19 were killed in Mansehra district, 10 in Kohistan, six in Shangla, four in Abbottabad and one in Swat.\n\nThe officer said the Balakot town of Mansehra has been severely hit. The earthquake was followed by several aftershocks.\n\nOfficials said the quake epicentre was 250km north of Peshawar in the Hindu Kush mountains. The seismological centre in Peshawar recorded its magnitude at 7.6.\n\nIn some places, the collapse of school buildings killed and injured students.\n\nFear of another earthquake was widespread in the wake of the eight aftershocks that rocked Peshawar and other places. Police and hospital sources said more than 250 injured people had been brought to hospitals from across the province, and more were being shifted there for medical treatment.\n\nAltaf Hussain : Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir : 1042GMT\n\nLatest reports from the border district tell us that 200 have died in that area.\n\nAs of now, the Indian government have promised full help to the area, and at the moment there has been no request for international help. But the picture is not clear yet.\n\nSome people are on the roadside, with no facilities, no food, awaiting aid. In other parts of the state, life is going on as usual.\n\nBarbara Plett : Islamabad, Pakistan : 1023GMT\n\nThe earthquake struck early in the morning, centred in the mountains of Pakistan-administered Kashmir. It was difficult to get a clear picture of the damage because telephone lines were down. But Pakistani officials said buildings collapsed in the region's capital, Muzaffarabad.\n\nThe interior minister, Aftab Sherpao, spoke of entire villages being wiped out. The army has mobilised its crisis-response teams. It sent medical aid in by helicopter because roads have been blocked by landslides.\n\nThe earthquake also left its mark further south. In one town, a school came down and in Pakistan's capital, Islamabad, part of an apartment block was reduced to rubble. Rescue workers are still trying to dig out people trapped beneath large stone slabs, and stretchers carry away bloodied survivors.\n\nSeismic activity is common in the volatile Hindu Kush mountains, but this is the strongest earthquake felt here in many years.\n\nAltaf Hussain : Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir : 1009GMT\n\nI now understand that 172 people have died in Indian-administered Kashmir, 157 civilians and 15 soldiers.\n\nThe reports say that there are more than 600 people injured. In Uri, it is believed that 104 people are dead. The authorities are running 500 tents to the area.\n\nArmy facilities have also been badly hit, which has a big knock-on effect on the rescue operation.\n\nNick Bryant : Delhi : 1002GMT\n\nWe did feel the tremors here in Delhi, but we are 965km (600m) away. I was on the ground floor and felt it shake. Those on higher floors would have found it very frightening.\n\nUri, on the road that links the divided territory, is badly damaged. I understand 70% of the buildings there have experienced some sort of structural damage.\n\nIt is a heavily militarised area and we understand some soldiers have been killed too.\n\nInformation is difficult to get at the moment, some of these areas are quite remote and communication is difficult in normal times.\n\nAltaf Hussain : Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir : 0956GMT\n\nThe Met office in Srinagar says the epicentre of the earthquake has been found in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, west of its capital, Muzaffarabad.\n\nThousands of houses in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir have been damaged. The civil administration has asked the army's main hospital in Srinagar to receive casualties.\n\nThe earthquake hit at 0925 local time. People ran out of their homes into open spaces, with women and children crying in panic. Hospitals have received hundreds of trauma cases.\n\nMany people are still staying out of their homes fearing more tremors. Most of the government offices and educational institutions have been closed.\n\nWaliur Rahman : Dhaka, Bangladesh : 0947GMT\n\nThe earthquake that struck the South Asian subcontinent has also jolted parts of Bangladesh. The earthquake caused widespread panic among residents at various cities and towns, but there was no immediate report of casualties or damage from anywhere of the country.\n\nAccording to the Earthquake Observation Centre in the south-eastern port city of Chittagong, the earthquake was of a magnitude of 5.4 and it was felt just before 1000 local time and lasted for about a minute.\n\nZaffar Abbas : Islamabad : 0925GMT\n\nThe Pakistani army have emergency teams and they are working now, moving towards the badly effected villages.\n\nThey have sent several helicopters with medical aid to the areas involved and they are hoping to bring in more helicopters from other cities.\n\nKashmir and the Pakistan northern region are badly hit. There are road blocks caused by landslides, which are hampering access by road. The telephone lines have come down too. It will be a while before we have a clear picture of the damage.\n\nEarly indications are that the devastation has been big and widespread.\n\nAltaf Hussain : Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir : 0855GMT\n\nOfficials in Indian-administered Kashmir say at least 60 people have died so far in the earthquake. They said of these 45 were civilians and 15 were army soldiers.\n\nAltaf Hussain : Srinagar : 0840GMT\n\nIt appears the town of Uri, near the Line of Control [between Indian- and Pakistani-controlled Kashmir], seems to have suffered the most damage. An army spokesman said 60-70% of the buildings in Uri have been damaged.\n\nThe main Uri market was engulfed in a major fire following the earthquake. Though the fire has been brought under control, it caused extensive damage to the shops.\n\nAltaf Hussain : Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir : 0803GMT\n\nPolice in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir say at least 22 people have been killed and hundreds injured after a powerful earthquake hit the state on Saturday morning.\n\nFive people are buried under the debris of a house.\n\nThe earthquake hit at 0925 local time. People ran out of their homes into open spaces with women and children crying in panic.\n\nMany people are still staying out of their homes fearing more tremors.\n\nBarbara Plett : Margala Towers, Islamabad, Pakistan : 0620GMT\n\nThere are desperate rescue efforts going on here. A number of floors of the apartment block collapsed and in front of me is a small hill of broken concrete over which and under which rescue workers are desperately trying to dig out survivors.\n\nA number of casualties have already been carried out on stretchers, but there are more underneath the rubble.\n\nEveryone is pitching in - official rescue workers, but also people who live here and those ordinary people who've just come to help.\n\nZaffar Abbas : Islamabad, Pakistan : 0527GMT\n\nThe big jolts in Islamabad and all its neighbouring towns and villages started around 0830 local time (0330 GMT).\n\nWithin minutes, reports had started to come in from places as far as Lahore, Quetta, Peshawar and Kashmir, of a major earthquake.\n\nMillions of panic-stricken people came out in the open as the tremors continued for nearly three minutes.\n\nInitial reports suggest there have been landslides in several places in the country's north and north-west region and in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.\n\nA number of villages in the mountainous area have been wiped out and road links have been cut from some of the towns and villages in northern Pakistan.\n\nBarbara Plett : Islamabad, Pakistan : 0520GMT\n\nI'm at a building called the Margala Towers in Islamabad. Part of it has collapsed and I'm looking at a small hill of concrete that people are running across frantically.\n\nAt the moment, straight ahead of me, there's a sort of cavity that people have gathered around. They're trying to pull survivors out and things are getting a bit frantic.\n\nThey've also brought up a water pipe that's gone up over the hill of concrete and they've been throwing up bottles of water - presumably to hand to those people who are stranded, either caught underneath the rubble or stranded in their apartment buildings.", 'title': "Reporters' log: Kashmir earthquake Oct 8", 'url': 'http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4321660.stm', 'keywords': ['oct', 'islamabad', 'army', 'kashmir', 'pakistan', 'earthquake', 'indianadministered', 'reporters', 'pakistanadministered', 'houses', 'muzaffarabad', 'log', 'srinagar'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Zaffar Abbas : near Muzaffarabad, Pakistan-administered Kashmir : 1615GMTWe have now made three attempts to go to Muzaffarabad from three different directions but have failed.\nAltaf Hussain : Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir : 1212GMTThe epicentre of the earthquake has been found in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, west of its capital, Muzaffarabad.\nAltaf Hussain : Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir : 1111GMTThe numbers of deaths have been rising and now it is estimated at around 200.\nAltaf Hussain : Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir : 1009GMTI now understand that 172 people have died in Indian-administered Kashmir, 157 civilians and 15 soldiers.\nAltaf Hussain : Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir : 0855GMTOfficials in Indian-administered Kashmir say at least 60 people have died so far in the earthquake.', 'date': 1128803739}, {'text': "Pakistan has confirmed more than 73,000 deaths, most of them in Pakistani-administered Kashmir.

Gen. Shaukat Sultan, a spokesman for Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, said Sunday. Sultan told CNN the figure was as of 7.am. (10 p.m. ET Saturday). CNN could not independently verify Sultan\'s figures. He said the magnitude 7.6 quake that struck Pakistan and parts of India and Afghanistan on Saturday morning had killed 18,020 and injured 41,188 people. Most of the dead, Sultan said, were in the Pakistani-controlled part of Kashmir, followed by the North-West Province and other northern areas. Among the dead were 215 army soldiers, including six officers, Sultan said. In addition, 414 soldiers were injured. President Musharraf planned to tour quake-struck areas again Sunday. The quake hit Saturday at 8:50 a.m. (11:50 p.m. ET Friday). Its epicenter was about 60 miles north-northeast of Pakistan\'s capital, Islamabad. It was felt in major cities, including Islamabad and Lahore, and India\'s capital of New Delhi. (See scenes of major damage in the capital - :44) The death toll is expected to rise, Sultan said, because rescue workers and the military have been unable to access some of the remote areas hit by the quake. He said entire villages and many roads have been wiped out by landslides. "The army has fully mobilized to handle this situation. This disaster is by far the biggest in its magnitude and scale so far that we have witnessed in Pakistan\'s history," the general said. "There is a lot that needs to be done. There are many areas that so far have not been reached. The death toll of 18,000 could be many-fold more as we reach more areas and as we discover more and more dead bodies under the rubble." The army is trying to evacuate the injured and set up medical camps and relief centers. Helicopters are airlifting supplies, then transporting injured people to hospitals. The army\'s biggest problem is trying to access remote areas, he said. Pakistan needs transport helicopters able to carry large machinery that can be used to clear debris. Until roads are cleared, relief operations will have to rely on helicopter flights, Sultan said. Emergency workers on Sunday are continuing to pull out the trapped, treat the injured and feed the homeless survivors of the earthquake. In Islamabad, nearly 24 hours after the quake hit, rescue workers were trying to free as many as 100 people trapped beneath a collapsed apartment building in Islamabad. At least 25 bodies were pulled from the rubble, along with eight survivors. Salim Bokhari, group editor with the English-language newspaper "The News," said from Lahore, Pakistan, that he had reports that 250 students were killed when a school building collapsed 40 miles from Islamabad. Also, he said, three school buildings were reported to have been destroyed in the Pakistani-ruled part of disputed Kashmir, killing more than 200 children. In addition, Bokhari said one of three hospitals in Pakistani Kashmir reportedly collapsed. In Amritsar, east of Lahore, a man sobbed as he described losing his business. "The earthquake struck and minutes after I got a call that smoke was coming out of my shop. I rushed and saw that my shop was on fire. I have suffered massive losses." Only one death was reported in Afghanistan. A young girl died in Jalalabad when a wall collapsed in her home. A U.S. soldier told CNN the quake was felt in Kabul, but "effects were minimal." Frantic efforts to rescue survivors continued in Islamabad early Sunday morning. Video footage from Pakistani television showed crowds of people climbing on the rubble of an apartment building and attempting to free those trapped under large concrete slabs. Some of the injured were carried away on stretchers. (Watch the latest rescue efforts - 1:10) Many people were still in their beds when the quake struck. Witness Malik Abdul Manan, who lives in Islamabad, said he and his family "woke up and ran out. The shocks went on for a long time." (More witness accounts) Stunned Pakistanis, many covered with blood, were camped out in the streets on Sunday, fearful of returning home because of aftershocks, one of which measured 6.3 in magnitude. "Even today, people are scared," Bokhari said. Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz called the earthquake "severe" and "a major catastrophe" and said it\'s a "traumatic experience" for citizens. Help offered Political tensions between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir region took a back seat as Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called President Pervez Musharraf and offered help. Musharraf thanked him for his offer. The two nations have fought three wars -- two of them over Kashmir -- since independence from British rule in 1947. Aziz, who saw aerial views of the devastation, said "we have provided for a lot of alternate housing. Luckily, the weather is not that cold yet so people are living in tents, sleeping bags. Blankets, water, food and a lot of help is coming from all over the country and overseas also." Earlier, the breakdown of 1,080 people killed in Pakistan included 520 in North-West Frontier province, 310 in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, and 50 in the Pakistani cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, according to figures from police, the Interior Ministry and local hospitals. Two hundred Pakistani soldiers were killed in Kashmir and northern areas of Pakistan, and 300 others were wounded, Sultan told CNN. In Indian-controlled Kashmir, or Jammu-Kashmir, the death toll stood at about 256, including 36 Indian soldiers, according to local government, army and police officials. Some 700 other people were injured in Jammu-Kashmir as well, including 82 soldiers, according to the police and military. Local officials estimate more than 1,000 dwellings have been damaged or destroyed across Jammu-Kashmir. Qamar Uz Zaman, director-general of the Pakistani Meteorological Department, told CNN that "this was the strongest earthquake in the area during the last hundred years." The United States, Britain, Germany, Turkey, Japan, the United Nations and non-governmental humanitarian groups have marshaled resources to help the region. (Details) Musharraf and Aziz reviewed rescue and relief operations at the collapsed apartment building -- the 10-story residential Margalla Tower. Rain and brisk winds hampered the effort late Saturday, but by the early hours of Sunday, the weather had cleared. Interior Minister Aftab Ahmed Khan Sherpao and senior military and civilian officials, were overseeing the operations and briefed the leaders. The government said Pakistan Army, Navy, Air Force, Police, Civil Administration and Capital Development Authority took part in the operations. How the quake compares with others The quake was "quite shallow," said David Applegate, senior science advisor for earthquake and geologic hazards for the U.S. Geological Survey. "That means the shaking is going to be very intense." The fact that Islamabad was near the epicenter "means a fairly large urban population has experienced some strong shaking," Applegate said. The National Earthquake Information Center put the quake at 7.6 magnitude, which it considers "major." The Pakistani Meteorological Department put the magnitude at 7.5, and Japan\'s Meteorological Agency put it at 7.8. In February 2004, a pair of earthquakes registering 5.5 and 5.4 magnitude killed at least 21 people and injured dozens more. Hundreds of homes built of mud, stone and timber were destroyed in a rugged, mountainous area about 90 miles northwest of Islamabad. In January 2001, some 20,000 people died in a magnitude 7.7 quake that was centered in southern India but also caused damage and deaths in Pakistan.

The deadliest recent quake in the region was in January 2001.

The country's new international profile adds a fresh dimension to its ongoing clash with Pakistan over Kashmir. So far, the conflict has not hindered India's rise. But the prospects that the two sides will reach a settlement on their own are dim.\n\nAlthough it is unlikely that the issue will frustrate India's ambitions to emerge as an Asian -- and a global -- power, periodic crises over the state will distract India's leaders, and tensions with Pakistan could spark yet another war. The United States can, and should, play a role in facilitating an end to the conflict by prodding both sides to reach an accord. Doing so will require that Washington change its stance toward both India and Pakistan, but the potential rewards -- peace on the subcontinent and a solid strategic partnership between Washington and New Delhi -- are well worth the effort.\n\nThe dispute over Kashmir has dogged relations between India and Pakistan since the states were created by the partition of British India in 1947. The two countries have fought three wars (in 1947-48, 1965, and 1999) over the issue and related matters; twice (in 1990 and 2001-2) they nearly resorted to the use of nuclear weapons. Intense international concern has prompted multilateral efforts to broker a formal conclusion to the dispute. Yet neither war nor negotiation has brought the issue any closer to a resolution, and there has been no significant change in the territory's status since the two sides first exchanged shots nearly 60 years ago. (India controls approximately two-thirds of the original state, and Pakistan administers most of the remainder. In 1963, Pakistan ceded a small tract of its territorial claim in northern Kashmir to China, thereby enabling China to build a road to connect the provinces of Tibet and Xinjiang).\n\nThe conflict grew out of competing projects of nation building.

It had a magnitude of 7.6 and is the most powerful to hit the region since 1950. The epicentre is estimated to have been just 10 kilometres (6.2 miles) below the surface.\n\nMore than 17,000 people have been reported killed in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir alone. Thousands more are reported dead in Pakistan’s North-West Frontier province and hundreds of casualties have been recorded in Indian-controlled Kashmir.\n\nA total of 43,000 people were injured in the disaster, said Pakistan’s interior minister Aftab Sherpao on Monday. But rescue workers have yet to reach up to 40% of those affected, and the United Nations warned that the number of people left homeless, possibly as many as 2.5 million, could rival the number displaced by the tsunami that struck south Asia in December 2004.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n144 aftershocks\n\nIn some regions rescuers have been forced to dig with their bare hands to find survivors. But efforts have been hampered by as many as 144 separate aftershocks, with one with a magnitude of 6.2. Landslides have also cut off communications and transport links to many devastated areas.\n\nMuzaffarabad bore the brunt of the destruction, with 11,000 of its inhabitants killed. Entire villages have been wiped out across Pakistan-controlled Kashmir and the cities of Bagh and Rawalakot have suffered major destruction.\n\nIn Pakistan’s North-West Frontier province more than 1600 people were reported dead, with at least 400 schoolchildren killed when two schools in the area collapsed. In Indian-controlled Kashmir the town of Kupwara, near the border, was worst hit: 250 bodies have so far been recovered.\n\nDonations and offers of support have poured in from the international community in response to the Pakistani government’s plea for aid. On Sunday the White House announced that the US would donate $50 million for relief and reconstruction efforts. The US is also flying over five CH-47 Chinook helicopters and three UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters from Afghanistan to help with rescue work. The European Union said it would donate $4.4 million and the UK has sent two emergency teams to the area.\n\nThe World Health Organization said rescue efforts would be complicated. “Existing hospitals have been damaged and some destroyed, with health personnel among the casualties,” said Khalif Bile Mohamud, the organisation’s representative in Pakistan. “As a result of the increased number of injured people, shortages in surgical supplies have been reported.”\n\nCollision zone\n\nThe devastated region lies along the fault line where the Indo-Australian and the Eurasian tectonic plates collide, pushing up the Himalayan mountain range. The Indo-Australian plate drives northwards at a rate of a few centimetres per year, pushing under the Eurasian plate and creating a zone that is prone to seismic activity.\n\nIt is impossible for seismologists to predict precisely when and where an earthquake will strike and how severe it will be. But in a study published in the journal Science in 2001, specialists from University of Colorado at Boulder and the Indian Institute for Astrophysics in Bangalore, India, reviewed historical evidence for seismic activity in the Himalayan region and concluded that a major earthquake was overdue. They estimated that two major earthquakes measuring 8.1 to 8.3 magnitude could strike at any moment.\n\nDavid Booth, a seismologist with the British Geological Survey in Edinburgh, UK, said buildings in the affected region were often too weak to withstand earthquakes. He added that, in the absence of accurate earthquake prediction, the only option is to ensure structures are built to withstand substantial tremors.\n\n“The type of construction [in this area] tends to be reinforced concrete filled in with brickwork,” he told New Scientist. “This provides very little resistance to lateral forces.”', 'title': 'Death toll from Pakistan quake reaches 30,000', 'url': 'https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8121-death-toll-from-pakistan-quake-reaches-30000/', 'keywords': ['number', 'reaches', 'region', 'pakistan', 'major', 'magnitude', 'quake', '30000', 'earthquake', 'rescue', 'reported', 'pakistans', 'killed', 'toll', 'million', 'death'], 'tags': {'Earth', 'News'}, 'summary': 'The death toll from the earthquake that devastated northern Pakistan on Saturday rose above 30,000 on Monday, as rescuers dug desperately for survivors and the country made an urgent call for international aid.\nThe earthquake struck at 0850 local time (0350 GMT) on Saturday, with the epicentre close to the city of Muzaffarabad.\nMore than 17,000 people have been reported killed in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir alone.\nThousands more are reported dead in Pakistan’s North-West Frontier province and hundreds of casualties have been recorded in Indian-controlled Kashmir.\n“Existing hospitals have been damaged and some destroyed, with health personnel among the casualties,” said Khalif Bile Mohamud, the organisation’s representative in Pakistan.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'Introduction\n\nWhen the earthquake struck, I was on my houseboat.

A fully loaded mule can carry up to 72kg and walk 26km without resting.\n\nDistance in the mountains is often calculated in time rather than kilometres, which means these mules can walk non-stop for seven to eight hours.\n\nIf required to go full distance, up to 18kg of their weight is replaced by especially prepared food consisting of chickpeas and sugar.\n\nThe mules are allowed to stop and eat at regular intervals and these stoppages are calculated in their travel time.\n\nOfficers with experience of ATUs say the mules are so well trained that they rarely exceed the time allocated to them.\n\nAnd having travelled a particular route over a period of five to six months, many can find their way from one camp to the next without human assistance.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, a herd of mules is accompanied by a horse rider. But under exceptional circumstances - such as periods of military tensions when extensive shelling is taking place across the Line of Control - the mules can carry rations and ammunition to the forward posts on their own.\n\n"It is not uncommon for us to set them off at last light and we get a message from the forward post the next day that they have arrived safely," an officer at Chikothi said.\n\n"And if they get stuck somewhere because of bad weather or a particularly bad landslide, they just return to base."\n\nDeadly tethers\n\nMilitary officials say it is often not easy for those outside the army to appreciate the services rendered by these animals.\n\nThese mules can carry up to 72kg and walk 26km\n\nVillagers, they say, would often laugh when they saw how much time and energy was being expended on the animals.\n\n"The mules have regular parades, including water parades and food parades," says Col Hussain.\n\n"Every unit has a doctor dedicated to their care and they have regular medical check ups which, mind you, even the soldiers evade at times."\n\nTheir trainers, too, are deeply attached to their mules.\n\nThe only area where the facilities afforded to mules do not match those of the humans is shelter.\n\nMilitary installations all over Kashmir and the northern areas - called hardship areas - are low-cost affairs.\n\nThe animals often have nothing more than a corrugated iron roof held up by wooden beams stuck in walls of stones.\n\nWhen the quake struck, all the mules were tethered.

But it is very difficult to lift the debris of a two-storey building without machines or equipment. You hear many such cries for help.\n\n“I kept on shouting for help for about one hour. People were going here and there. They would see me and move away without any help,” said Fauzia, a 25-year-old university student who was buried under the rubble of her two-storey house. Finally her injured sister, Bushra, managed to persuade some relatives to pull Fauzia out.\n\nLuckily, Fauzia did not receive any major injury. “I saw death so closely, it’s a new lease of life for me,” she says. I recited verses from the Holy Quran, whatever I could remember, in the belief that death was a few seconds away.\n\nThere is practically no government in Muzaffarabad at the moment. It’s complete chaos everywhere. Roads to and from the town are closed, except the one linking it with Islamabad through Abbottabad. People were walking on foot from the capital to Lohargali, about 10km towards Mansehra, to find safe places.\n\nThere was no electricity supply till Sunday. Some telephone lines are now working, but sporadically. Those with their own vehicles were moving out of the capital through the Abbotabad road but otherwise fuel was not available. Some people helped themselves to take petrol and diesel from petrol pumps to leave the city on Sunday night.\n\nMilitary helicopters are mostly bringing back their own injured and dead colleagues and a limited number of civilians. Almost all the military personnel stationed at Muzaffarabad’s Shaukat Lane have either died or been seriously injured.\n\nMuzaffarabad’s Combined Military Hospital (CMH) is no longer there. Many doctors and nurses along with tens of patients are believed to have been killed when the building collapsed. Eyewitnesses said no one could be evacuated from the children’s and gynaecology wards of the CMH.\n\nThe whole Old Campus of the Azad Kashmir University has been flattened. Many students, teachers and other staff of three departments, botany, geology and computer science, were killed. A fire was said to have erupted there immediately after the earthquake.\n\nAbout 600 children were in the Rizwan Public School when its building collapsed. About 124 children were reported to have been rescued by their relatives. Similarly, witnesses said they saw hundreds of dead schoolgirls in the Islamabad School and College in Muzaffarabad and the Soheli Sarkar Girls Higher Secondary School and Girls High School, Narrol.\n\nSaima, a university student, said her cousin Asma died in front of her eyes along with dozens of other girls in the girls’ hostel of the AJK University as she ran out and later identified her dead body.\n\nThe populous Madina Market, a shopping centre-cum-residential area, the famous Kashmiri and Khwaja mohallas, Sethi Bagh and Kalar Syeddan and the Liaqat Market in front of the old AJK University have all disappeared. No one had reached these areas until Monday morning. A couple of thousands of deaths could not be ruled out there, a number of locals said.\n\nIn Madina Market’s remains, I found that it was not possible to move without touching bodies. At least five close relatives of this reporter died and many others were injured in Muzaffarabad.\n\nIn front of the National Bank’s main branch is the decades-old building of the Central jail. Most of the inmates died under its rubble; the rest have opted to move away. There is no difference now between the law-breaker and the law-enforcer. This reporter saw a handcuffed prisoner walking away barefoot with a number of other people towards Lohargali.\n\nAJK minister Shireen Waheed and her husband Waheed Khan were also reported dead at the Neelum View Hotel where many others also lost their lives. Many buildings including a portion of Sangam Hotel slid into the Jhelum along with many dwellers.\n\nAfter the visit to Muzaffarabad, one reaches the conclusion that more than 80 per cent of the city has been devastated. It is apparent that at least 50 per cent of the havoc was due to the complicity of government agencies and contractors in raising substandard buildings.\n\nMost of the buildings destroyed are government buildings — hospitals, schools, colleges and offices. The under-construction Supreme Court building, assembly secretariat and the new secretariat did not collapse, but are unusable now owing to the large cracks that have appeared in the buildings.\n\nGenerally, there was poor mobilization for rescue work, both by the government and civilians and NGOs. Everybody was looking for their own relatives and there was no joint effort to save those crying out from the debris.\n\nBut even in this state of mayhem, greed did not vanish. There were many who moved around to collect valuables from the devastated houses.\n\nOne cannot find any building from the Saheli Sarkar shrine to the north-east end of Muzzafarabad, a stretch of about three kilometres, while the Jhila Bandi bridge, which links Neelum Valley with the city, was badly damaged and was no more drivable. Similarly, the Chakoti bridge linking AJK with the occupied Kashmir was also reported damaged.\n\nUppar Chattar, a residential colony of about 1,000 private houses, is the only locality of Muzaffarabad where damage was almost invisible, and where many people had taken shelter.\n\nA senior official of AJK planning department told this reporter that it would be impossible to revive Muzaffarabad in the next 40 years. He said it would be economically more prudent and cost effective to set up the capital at a new place because replacement of debris would cost a lot owing to congested space in the ruined city.\n\nThis reporter also witnessed digging of a large area some two kilometres from the AJK Legislative Assembly for mass graves. The bodies were being buried without shrouds as some had started decomposing.\n\nAn emergency programme would be required to cope with the looming outbreak of diseases.', 'title': 'Muzaffarabad in ruins', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/160659', 'keywords': ['girls', 'ruins', 'ajk', 'university', 'died', 'muzaffarabad', 'debris', 'school', 'relatives', 'reporter', 'building'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'MUZAFFARABAD, Oct 10: This capital of Azad Kashmir of 0.2 million is no more a city of the living.\nSimilarly, witnesses said they saw hundreds of dead schoolgirls in the Islamabad School and College in Muzaffarabad and the Soheli Sarkar Girls Higher Secondary School and Girls High School, Narrol.\nAt least five close relatives of this reporter died and many others were injured in Muzaffarabad.\nAfter the visit to Muzaffarabad, one reaches the conclusion that more than 80 per cent of the city has been devastated.\nA senior official of AJK planning department told this reporter that it would be impossible to revive Muzaffarabad in the next 40 years.', 'date': 1128988800}, {'text': 'Battling through on a road assessment mission\n\nToday our main objective is to assess the two major road links for the relief community out of Muzaffarabad - the Neelum and the Jhelum roads.\n\nBefore any trip, we always make sure that they pack their 4x4 truck with enough food, water, warm clothes and sleeping bags just in case another landslide or rock-fall blocks the road and they end up stranded for a few days.\n\nThat is exactly what happened a few weeks ago to Saeed and Jawed, two of the 25 Hunza mountain guides working with us, doing assessments throughout the earthquake affected areas.\n\nThey were working near Panjkot, in the Neelum valley, when, after three days of rain, major landslides erased parts of the road. They were stuck in Panjkot for five days.\n\nAfter every rainfall, the Neelum road becomes too dangerous to travel on. Even after the Pakistani army has cleared the road of major debris for the hundredth time since the earthquake, constant rock-falls pose a major threat.\n\nA heavily damaged vehicle on the side of the road, waiting to fall even lower towards the river, is a reminder of the dangers that threaten every traveller.\n\nRock-falls\n\nToday traffic was not interrupted. Local buses and jeeps were speeding through, avoiding as best they could the rocks falling from higher up.\n\nClaude-Andre Nadon (left) with another Canadian guide\n\nPeople are in a hurry, because they know at any time the road could again be blocked for a few days or even weeks.\n\nThen they would have to carry food or other important items on their backs for long stretches.\n\nWe stopped at Patyka, 20km out of Muzaffarabad, not wishing to travel any further into the Neelum valley. With many stories of accidents due to rock-falls or landslides, we do not want to push our luck.\n\nSo we stopped at a roadside tea shop and got detailed information from people who have just travelled the entire length of the valley.\n\nWe are looking for any information that might help the WFP and the other UN agencies to deliver their precious cargo.\n\nOn a day like today, most of the distribution will be hampered by the poor conditions of the road.\n\nWe then head back to Muzaffarabad and continue the assessments on the Jhelum road.\n\n\'No warning\'\n\nSo today, nothing to report. The rain has not set off any more landslides. Not yet anyway! The problem is that it can happen any time.\n\nRocks like this regularly fall on the roads without warning\n\nJust a few days ago, the vehicle of one of our colleagues was hit by a giant rock on this same road. He was killed instantly.\n\nSince this tragic accident, guides from the UNOPS are all the more anxious when they travel on these roads. Rock-falls and landslides give no warning!\n\nLandslides are indeed a major worry at the moment.\n\nRoad access is extremely bad in the earthquake area in particular in the Neelum and Jhelum Valley, where the UN Department for Security and Safety has in the last week logged more than 70 landslides.\n\nMudslides usually occur after a few days of heavy rain. But rock-slides happen all the time.\n\n"Kashmiris say they occur every year but this year is particularly bad, the landscape has been made fragile by the earthquake and the aftershocks continue to destabilise the slopes" explains a UN field security officer.\n\nLast week and several months after the tragic event of 8 October, an earthquake measuring 5.2 on the Richter Scale with its epicentre 20km north of Muzaffarabad shook the soil once more.\n\nBut the worse may be still to come.\n\n\'Dangerous\'\n\nLandslides are expected to occur with more frequency and severity, particularly following the snow melt in March and during the monsoon rains in July and August.\n\nThe monsoons may increase landslides in the region\n\nAccording to the International Landslide Centre at the University of Durham and the Landslide Observatory at the University of Maryland, there will be an increased risk of slope failures during the monsoon season and many of these will be large scale and destructive.\n\nTwo weeks ago, one small landslide alone resulted in 14 fatalities.\n\n"The situation changes by the hour, it is difficult to always have a complete picture, the landslides are very dangerous," says Mathieu Bastien, a mountain guide from the UNOPS, also conducting road assessment missions for the WFP around Muzaffarabad.\n\nIt will take years to restore the roads, particularly the secondary and tertiary routes that link the most remote communities.\n\nThe arterial roads will be cleared by the Pakistani Corps of Engineers but subject to recurrent slides.\n\nWithout helicopters, assistance to the most remote places will be difficult or even impossible.\n\n\'Lifeline\'\n\nWFP plans to assist about 670,000 people through food-for work, food for training and asset creation projects, in the most remote areas of Kashmir. The neediest of them will receive food aid until the next harvest in October and November 2006.\n\nHelicopters are lifelines for delivering aid\n\nWFP\'s helicopter operation, which has been a lifeline for hundreds of thousands of people during the winter months, is running short of funds.\n\nThe operation, with a reduced fleet, still needs $24m to sustain until the end of August when it is hoped that most of the agricultural inputs, tools and equipment for recovery will have been strategically positioned.\n\n"Some people believe that if the helicopters stop tomorrow, we will just continue the deliveries by truck, this may not be practical in all instances. The road situation is just too dangerous and roads are often blocked," says Aslam Khan, head of the WFP office in Muzaffarabad.\n\nWhen the roads are blocked, helicopters are the only way to deliver the volume of tools, the seeds, fertilisers and the construction material that people in the remote villages will need to resume their lives.\n\n"Road conditions and helicopter availability will determine the speed of the rehabilitation process," explains Michael Jones, the WFP country director.\n\nIf people originating from the mountain communities are not assured of access to food and other essential items until the harvest in October, they will most certainly stay in tented camps.\n\n"The cost of providing this assistance in camps will exceed three fold," says Jones. "And prolonging people\'s stay in the camps will also postpone return, recovery and reconstruction."', 'title': 'Navigating the roads of quake-hit Kashmir', 'url': 'http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4825528.stm', 'keywords': ['neelum', 'roads', 'kashmir', 'road', 'landslides', 'major', 'remote', 'wfp', 'food', 'earthquake', 'quakehit', 'muzaffarabad', 'navigating'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Battling through on a road assessment missionToday our main objective is to assess the two major road links for the relief community out of Muzaffarabad - the Neelum and the Jhelum roads.\nThey were working near Panjkot, in the Neelum valley, when, after three days of rain, major landslides erased parts of the road.\nAfter every rainfall, the Neelum road becomes too dangerous to travel on.\nIt will take years to restore the roads, particularly the secondary and tertiary routes that link the most remote communities.\nThe road situation is just too dangerous and roads are often blocked," says Aslam Khan, head of the WFP office in Muzaffarabad.', 'date': 1143140520}, {'text': '"There are cities, there are towns which have been completely destroyed.

The worst hit place was Bagh, 40 kilometres southeast of Muzaffarabad, Farooq said. Between 6000 and 7000 people are estimated to have died in the town and adjoining areas, Farooq said.\n\n"There are no survivors in villages like Jaglari, Kufalgarh, Harigal and Baniyali in Bagh district," Farooq said. "People have been devoured by the earth."\n\nPakistan\'s Minister For Kashmir Affairs, Faisal Hayat, said that half of Kashmir had been "severely affected by the earthquake". "Out of a population of 2.4 million more than half is affected," apparently referring to those displaced, injured or killed. Meanwhile, about 45 aftershocks have rocked Pakistan and caused further damage, the chief of the country\'s meteorological department said today.\n\nThe latest aftershock came just before 2pm (1900 AEST) and measured 6.0 on the Richter scale, Qamar Uzzman said, while there have been at least four above 5.5 since the initial quake early yesterday. "These are quite destructive. They must be very dangerous aftershocks for those near the epicentre," he added. "Forty-five aftershocks have been recorded, all were above four, which is moderate."\n\nRescuers today dug out hundreds of dead children buried under their schools and found villages reduced to rubble. Teams laboured with cranes and earth-moving equipment or used their bare hands in hopes of finding survivors trapped beneath shattered masonry from yesterday\'s quake. Striking out from the forest clad mountains of Pakistani Kashmir near the border with India, the quake was the strongest to hit south Asia in a century.\n\n"When the earthquake came it was like Judgment Day," said villager Fazal Elahi, recalling the horror of houses collapsing around him as he grieved quietly next to the body of his 14-year-old daughter. President Pervez Musharraf\'s spokesman, Major-General Shaukat Sultan, earlier said a further 40,000 people were injured and called it the worst devastation in Pakistan\'s history.\n\n"There are many villages that have been wiped off the face of this earth," Sultan said. Pakistan\'s side of Kashmir, the Himalayan region disputed with India, was expected to be worst hit. Many areas had not been reached because landslides triggered by the quake had wiped out roads, Sultan said.\n\nThe US Geological Survey said the tremor occurred at a depth of 10km. It struck about 95 kilometres northeast of Islamabad and was felt across the subcontinent, shaking buildings in the Afghan, Indian and Bangladeshi capitals. The first quake was followed over the next 18 hours by more than 20 aftershocks with magnitudes of between 4.5 and 6.3.\n\nSome 400 children were killed at two schools in Pakistan\'s North-West Frontier Province. Damage in Pakistani Kashmir\'s main city, Muzaffarabad, was believed to be severe. "Indications are that almost 50 per cent of the homes have been destroyed," Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz told BBC World television, referring to Muzaffarabad and neighbouring towns.\n\nPrivate Geo TV reported that some of Muzaffarabad\'s main buildings, including a military hospital, had been destroyed, and that injured people were lying in the courtyard of the one working hospital waiting for attention from doctors struggling to cope. A military spokesman said 215 Pakistani soldiers were killed in the hardest-hit areas.\n\nIndian Kashmir was also battered by the earthquake. Police said more than 300 people had been killed and hundreds injured. Half of the Indian deaths were in Uri, the last big town on the road connecting the two sides of the violence-scarred region. The dead included 15 soldiers, some in bunkers close to a military ceasefire line. Landslides blocked the 300km road that connects Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian Kashmir, to the rest of India to the south.\n\nThe Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road linking Indian and Pakistani Kashmir, reopened to traffic this year for the first time in nearly 60 years, was also blocked. Ghulam Rashool, an official at the Pakistan Meteorological Department, said it was the strongest earthquake in South Asia since the 1905 Kangra earthquake that killed 20,000 people in India\'s Madhya Pradesh state.\n\nIn the Pakistani capital Islamabad, 82 survivors were recovered from two multi-storey apartment blocks that were reduced to rubble. A government official said rescuers also found 14 bodies, including those of at least three foreigners, an Egyptian and two Japanese. Pledges of aid from around the world came within hours. Britain said it was sending search and rescue experts, sniffer dogs and aid workers and US President George Bush said aid was on the way.\n\nUN Secretary-General Kofi Annan sent condolences to Pakistan, and a UN Disaster and Coordination Team in Geneva was on standby to be deployed. Oxfam and other aid agencies planned to coordinate their response with the United Nations. Turkey, which has suffered major earthquakes in the past, said it had sent two military planes carrying aid, doctors and rescue workers. Japan sent a team of 49 aid workers.\n\nIn a further sign of easing tension between India and Pakistan, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf to offer assistance. There were no reports of any Australians among the dead or injured.

President Pervez Musharraf made an urgent appeal for money and helicopters to get aid to the worst affected zones -- the rugged terrain of the North West Frontier Province and the towering Himalayan mountains of Kashmir.\n\n"We do seek international assistance," he was quoted as saying by the Associated Press of Pakistan. "There is a need for large supplies of medicines, tents and cargo helicopters to reach out to the people in far-flung and cut-off areas. The bigger these copters, the better."\n\nMusharraf\'s chief spokesman, Major General Shaukat Sultan, said the death toll could continue to soar. "It is the biggest ever disaster in the history of Pakistan," Sultan said. Sherpao, the interior minister, said around 11,000 of the dead were in Muzaffarabad, the capital of the Pakistan-controlled sector of Kashmir, the Himalayan mountain region which is divided into Indian and Pakistani areas.\n\n"There are cities, there are towns which have been completely destroyed," Minister for Works and Communication Tariq Farooq said. "Muzaffarabad is devastated." The earthquake struck yesterday morning as schools were beginning classes, and hundreds if not thousands of children are feared to have died when cheaply-built concrete buildings collapsed or were engulfed by landslides.\n\n"There is no hope of survival for some 350 children who were trapped in the debris in three schools here," said Yameen Khan, police chief of Mansehra, one of the worst-hit districts. Landslides blocked the steep mountain roads and powerful aftershocks sowed terror among survivors, dislodging huge boulders from further up the hillsides. Rain, hail and freezing temperatures added to the misery. "Our priority is to open the roads and remove the dead and the injured," interior minister Sherpao said, adding that a three-day period of nationwide mourning had been declared from today.\n\nThe scale of the disaster has shocked the international community and brought pledges of aid and expressions of sympathy. Officials said surgeons were being despatched to Kashmir along with nine helicopter loads of emergency aid. They said bad weather and the destruction of infrastructure was severely affecting relief efforts.\n\nThe epicentre was close to the dividing line between Indian and Pakistani controlled zones of Kashmir, and scores of soldiers on both sides died when their heavily-fortified positions collapsed around them. In Indian Kashmir, state government chief secretary Vijay Bakaya said 583 people had been killed and that around 700 had been injured. On the other side of the Line of Control, the heavily militarised de facto border between the two sides, Pakistan\'s army lost 140 soldiers in Muzaffarabad and 86 in other places, the interior minister said.\n\nNuclear-armed India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, but a peace process is under way and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh immediately reached out to Musharraf to offer help. "While parts of India have also suffered from this unexpected natural disaster, we are prepared to extend any assistance with rescue and relief which you may deem appropriate," Singh said.\n\nUS President George W Bush said help was on the way while the European Union earmarked three million euros ($A4.73 million) for the rescue effort. The Australian government pledged an initial $A500,000 in medical and relief assistance with Prime Minister John Howard indicating more would be provided if needed. "Our thoughts are very much with the people of Pakistan in particular, and Afghanistan and India," Mr Howard said.\n\n"I just want the government and people of Pakistan to know if there is other help we can provide, we will.

Chinese state media said Beijing had sent a 49-man rescue team, while the United Nations also sent supplies and personnel. For some, the rescue effort succeeded in time.

In New Delhi, about 1100 kilometres away from the epicentre, the earthquake was strong enough to make buildings sway for at least a minute. About 350 Indians have been killed in the earthquake, mainly in Kashmir.\n\nWhile tremors were felt as far as away Kabul and New Delhi, mountainous northern Pakistan took the brunt of the impact. Most of the scenes of destruction were being televised from Islamabad, but the quake\'s epicentre was in Muzaffarabad, where villages and even small towns are believed to have been wiped off the map by land and mud slides. The nearby town of Uri was flattened. Rescue efforts were well under way in the Himalayan foothills, with supplies being flown in and the injured being airlifted to hospitals. However, efforts were being severely hampered by the remoteness of many of the affected villages, badly damaged roads and heavy rainfall. With road transport limited, the Pakistani military was restricted to using helicopters, slowing down the deployment of earthmoving and other machinery.\n\nPakistan and India have numerous bases in the disputed region, and this has helped with the rapid deployment of soldiers as part of the rescue effort. Political tensions over Kashmir appear to have been put on hold, with the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, telephoning President Pervez Musharraf to offer help.\n\nThere have also been reports of extraordinary co-operation between the opposing forces, such as meetings between Indian and Pakistani troops along the line of control to organise rescue efforts.

For days as remote villagers waited for help from Pakistan\'s military-dominated Government, fleet-footed mujahideen with good knowledge of the region\'s mountainous terrain filled the gap, providing food and medical aid. The epicentre of the quake, 95 kilometres north-east of Islamabad, has since the 1980s been home to training camps where Islamist militants are drilled in the use of automatic weapons and high explosives for the ongoing struggle in Kashmir.\n\nAt the forefront of the relief response has been an organisation called Jamaat-ul-Dawa, considered a charitable front for the notorious Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group. Lashkar-e-Taiba was banned by the Pakistan Government in 2002, but still operates, and Jamaat-ul-Dawa was placed on the country\'s terrorism watch list in 2003. According to some reports, Jamaat-ul-Dawa\'s field hospitals are better than the army\'s. In addition to relief efforts, the militants are reportedly taking orphaned children under their wing for indoctrination in their extensive network of orphanages. Offering work to some of the million people estimated by the International Labour Organisation to have lost their livelihoods due to the quake will likely be another route to recruitment.\n\nThis places Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf in a tight spot. While his Government acknowledges Jamaat-ul-Dawa\'s good work, it denies the organisation is exploiting the disaster. Yet visiting the region with UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Friday, General Musharraf felt compelled to warn victims to be wary of help from militants. "If someone shows extremism, you should rise up against it," he said. Leaked reports from Indian intelligence have described a wave of terrorist violence in Indian-controlled Kashmir since the quake as a virtual recruiting drive. Having displayed their compassion in action, the Lashkar-e-Taiba\'s armed cells have been told to publicly display their valour, say reports quoting confessions from arrested militants.\n\nSince the quake, the Government has been criticised for everything from Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz\'s penchant for expensive suits to the decision a few days after the quake to spend $US1 billion on Swedish-made early warning aircraft. The $US5.8 billion pledged by foreign donors is embarrassingly close to the amount Islamabad was planning to spend buying a fleet of F-16 fighter jets from the US.

However, it felt stronger than a 5.3-magnitude quake registered overnight with an epicenter in the mountainous region of Kashmir, which was worst affected by the main Oct. 8 earthquake.\n\nMeanwhile, aid workers warned on Monday that exposure and infection could trigger a second wave of deaths atop the 54,000 estimated killed in South Asia\'s earthquake, while thousands of injured people languished without shelter and medical care in villages across the stricken Himalayan region of Kashmir.\n\n"It\'s the injured who most urgently need help," said Bill Berger, leader of the USAID disaster assistance response team. The Pakistani Foreign Ministry said more than 80,000 people were injured in the Oct. 8 earthquake, and relief officials say many people who were seriously hurt by falling debris remain cut off in the isolated mountains of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, where most of the destruction happened.\n\nStill there were incredible stories of survival, like that of 8-year-old Abdul Jabbar who was spotted by a Pakistani helicopter in the village of Jarid among the rubble of his aunt\'s house. He had been visiting his aunt and her family, all of whom were killed, and it was unclear how he managed to survive so long on his own.\n\nHe was picked up by the military and flown to safety in his home village of Haripur, where he was reunited safely with his family.\n\nHelicopters, which resumed flying relief missions on Monday after heavy rains forced the suspension of most flights, have ferried thousands to hospitals in Pakistani cities.\n\nAn estimated 54,000 people died in the quake, and the death toll is expected to rise. The UN has estimated 3.3 million need food and shelter ahead of the winter. The Pakistani military, civilian volunteers and international aid groups are rushing aid and doctors to the region, as fast as the logistical challenges allow. Landslides caused by the earthquake cut off many roads, which will take several weeks to clear.\n\nIn the village of Kanur, survivors standing on the rubble of their homes waved colored clothes to attract the attention of a Pakistani military helicopter flying through the mountains, then begged its crew to take on board injured villagers.\n\n"Please take my daughter! Please take my daughter!" pleaded Tanvir Hussain, who lost two sons, two daughters and his wife in the disaster. His remaining daughter, 6-year-old Razila, suffered two fractured legs.\n\nRazila, sobbing in pain, was among six badly hurt girls and women who boarded the helicopter and were shifted to a makeshift hospital in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan\'s part of Kashmir. About 30 other seriously injured people were left behind.\n\nIt was the first time that a relief flight had reached Kanur, 38 miles north of Muzaffarabad.\n\nAt the helicopter\'s next stop, Kel Garam, a village where 250 died in the quake, villagers had fashioned a helipad in a clearing in hopes that a chopper would bring supplies. It landed near the local mosque, whose walls had been cracked by the temblor.\n\n"My wife is injured, my brother is killed, another of my brothers lost a leg and we are waiting for help," said resident Sayed Wahab Shah.\n\nSoldiers handed out relief goods, including blankets and food — but no tents, the most badly needed item in these hills. There was only room for one of the village\'s 30 seriously injured people to catch the flight out.\n\nArmy spokesman Col.

If some are yet to get rehabilitated, others are trying to get over the emotional and psychological stress caused by the October 8 tragedy. Aditi Tandon checks out the ground situation\n\n\n\nBIG loss: The quake left lakhs shelterless.\n\n\x97 Photo by HelpAge India\n\nBLEAK PICTURE: Villagers of the remote Chappar village in Uri are still awaiting adequate relief. \x97 Photo by the writer F rom a faraway cliff, Chappar looks rather sad. Forlorn and forgotten \x96 the hamlet raises desperate cries for attention until its voice breaks. People here, as in scores of villages in the Uri and Tangdhar sectors hit by the October 8 earthquake last year, are far from healed. They spend their days recounting horrors of the disaster that came knocking at their doors and robbed their land of its vitality. It took away homes from villages; and people from homes. If that was less, it took from people their will to strike back`85. And this, for evident reasons \x96 like Chappar, several villages in the Uri sector of Kashmir are located well beyond the reach of relief agencies that are chalking out a road map for the future of the disaster-struck area. Dangerously perched along the Line of Control, many of these quake-affected settlements are located about 10 to 20 km uphill or downhill from Sarai, the last motorable point in Uri. From here on, a risky trek must be undertaken to extend help to the remotest of the remote villages. While some villages like Chappar and Shahdra (in Baramula district of Kashmir) can be reached on foot, there are others like Dullanja that can only be accessed by a ropeway. The ropeway transports only two people at a time and operates under strict regimentation, as the area is under Army surveillance. To make matters more inconvenient, the ropeway runs only between 10 am and 5 pm. Dullanja on the LoC remains the worst affected of all quake-hit areas in the Valley. Almost impossible to reach, only one team of health workers, sponsored by HelpAge India, has held a medical camp in this small village post October 8. Survival instinct One of their many disturbing findings is the dangerously low level of iron among the women of this village, which now resembles a flat ground. Most of the men of the village have died; livestock has perished; and land has become unyielding by the severe impact of the quake. "The soil," says Ashfaq-ul-Hassan, an elderly man of the village, "is still rich and can grow maize and paddy but there is no water to irrigate the land. The Jhelum flows much below the level of the village, and all natural sources of water have either dried up or changed course following the earthquake." Given the odds, villagers are finding it difficult to pick up the threads and start afresh. By and by the survival instinct is coming back to the devastated people of the area. Never mind that it is coming back in traces, with a considerable number of people still reeling under the invisible, but palpable, psychological stress \x97 the legacy of the October 8 tragedy. In what can be called the first phase of rehabilitation in the Valley, about 1000 affected families have been given food, clothing and shelter. Voluntary agencies like HelpAge International, HelpAge India, Care India, Coalition of Civil Societies, Corporate Outreach of India, Sanatan Sangathan (Punjab) and others have stayed put in the disaster-torn belt to ensure immediate relief to the affected households. People have been fed, clothed and treated for all visible ailments and injuries. Mental trauma What they have not been treated for is a deeper psychological trauma that threatens their welfare with the sheer nature of its complexity. Psychiatrists describe the psychological disorders as "potentially fatal to the well-being of the affected people" and insist on acute crisis intervention and psychological rehabilitation of the traumatised population. Dr Arshad Hussain from the Srinagar-based Psychiatric Diseases Hospital reasons, "Mental health is a casualty of conflict and disaster. From 1989 to 2005, the number of mental health patients in the Valley has swollen from 1800 to 60,000. After the quake, we have witnessed an alarming rise in the cases of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). "Our studies show that a patient of PTSD takes five to seven years to come to us for treatment and he takes not less than six months to show the first signs of recovery. It is, therefore, important to link the affected people with support systems and engage them in their routines. It is equally important to respect their dignity while undertaking relief work. We must understand the psyche of disaster-hit people. They first experience euphoria, triggered by their survival against odds. After the euphoria, denial sets in and this denial manifests in numerous forms." One of the manifestations is anxiety disorder, which is at an all-time increase in the level of substance abuse in Kashmir. Earlier restricted to urban areas, it has now spread to rural belts as well. Stress caused by the earthquake is reflected in many other brutal ways. At Bela base camp in Uri where HelpAge has provided 300 temporary shelters to quake-hit families, a crude manifestation of depression was on play. In a bid to seek attention, some parents were eagerly displaying their surviving wards to first-time visitors. Mohammad Shafaq, father of a three-year-old surviving girl child, was one of them. He moved the child centrestage and instructed her to narrate the sequences of that day. "Beta batao zalzala kaise aaya tha aur aap malbe ke neeche kaise paanch ghante pade the`85" (Tell everyone about the earthquake and how you remained trapped under the debris for five hours.) The tutored child began her narration, least aware of the after effects of such an insensitive exercise. Psychologists say parents indulge in such activities to find outlets for their own pain. "Disaster dis-empowers people. Hence our stress on psycho-social rehabilitation to root out abnormality and empower people by restoring their livelihood," says Dr Hussain. Struck by the declining standards of mental health in Kashmir, the state government is exploring the possibility of running psychiatry OPDs in general hospitals all over the state. At present, patients have to travel all the way to the Psychiatric Diseases Hospital in Srinagar for treatment. "This arrangement is a deterrent. We advocate six-day OPDs in all hospitals. We are also trying to conduct as many mental health camps in quake-hit sites as possible," Dr Hussain, also Registrar at the Hospital, says. NGOs engaged in the rehabilitation task could not overemphasise the need to restore livelihoods. HelpAge International (HI) and HelpAge India are working towards this end and their experts have outlined strategies to employ youth by reviving mountain ecology through regeneration of natural resources. Bill Gray, HelpAge International\x92s Emergencies Manager from London, and his Indian counterpart Avinash Datta were recently in Uri to conduct a survey for livelihood potential. Power for people The NGO has decided to train 3000 youths in masonry and carpentry \x96 the two skills that are grossly underdeveloped locally. "The youth should be able to reconstruct razed houses in Kashmir. Another area of our intervention is community-owned and managed micro hydel power stations where the we have sought the expertise of Yogeshwar Kumar, who successfully launched a similar project in Orissa," says Datta. Kumar\x92s project, if implemented, will be a blessing in disguise for villagers who are complaining of lack of power. The project is most suitable for people below poverty line who can do a lot of work by having an energy source of their own. "In case of micro hydel power stations, we motivate the community to give us land. We set up the station with a power potential up to 100 KW, train their youth in managing the project and show the villagers other benefits of electricity in subsidiary businesses like carpentry, grinding and food processing. Once this project comes through, at least 50 households will have two KW of power each. They can then even work out a system of tariff collection." Another good news is that the J&K Government has amended the Electricity Act to allow private generation of electricity. Till now, the state was buying power worth Rs 1000 crore. Kumar says his project would revolutionise the power sector in the Valley. He has already signed MoUs with villagers at two sites in Uri, one being three km short of Aman Setu across the LoC. Apart from this, Kumar will train locals in the sophisticated art of wool processing, facilitating the production of traditional Kashmiri felts (namdas), which can be marketed both locally and outside. The projects will be carried out in nine villages of Uri tehsil in Baramula district, which HelpAge has adopted for rehabilitation. These are Bela, Jabda, Batar, Alphanda, Mohura, Shahdra, Kundibarjala, Chappar and Dachee. A recent survey in these areas reflected total lack of masonry skill locally, loss of livelihoods due to disturbance of traditional occupations like farming, cattle rearing and craftsmanship. A major setback for many families was loss of livestock on which they depended for earnings. Sakina, now relocated at Bela camp, lost all her livestock and as a consequence her source of income. Through its Livestock Programme, HelpAge plans to equip the families of affected villages with dairy farming, sheep and goat-rearing, poultry farming, bee-keeping and mule-rearing for transportation of goods across the hills. While loss of livelihood is a part of the problem, another, more critical issue, concerns the supply of drinking water to people of these areas. Shabnam Ara, an NGO activist, says, "Most villages are rainfed, and there is no other source of drinking water except the few seasonal and perennial water streams. These streams are far away from the project villages of HelpAge and women of the family have to spend a lot of time fetching drinking water. Post earthquake, these streams have also vanished." Sher Naman, 90, who broke his upper arm on the day of the quake, adds, "Streams have shifted track or have been submerged under the effect of the earthquake. Earlier we used to take water from one perennial stream or the other. But since these streams have changed course, there is no water to irrigate the land even for short-duration crops like vegetables." On the one hand, agriculture has taken a beating; on the other hand the promised six-month supply of government ration has stopped. HelpAge is now planning to develop spring spots existing in the area and construct rainwater harvesting structures to conserve water for drinking purposes. The work needs to be undertaken on a war footing lest the affected households spend the last penny of compensation amount on buying eatables for sustenance. Food crisis Ozair Nissar, a Kashmir University student, who has worked as a volunteer in Tangdhar and Uri, observes, "Each affected family got about Rs 40,000 in lieu of a plot and about Rs 50,000 out of the promised compensation of one lakh. But people are spending the money in buying vegetables and other things. The government must do something to prevent the food crisis." While it is proving backbreaking to provide even basic necessities, the disruption of educational services also poses a big challenge. Most school buildings have come down, and no reconstruction efforts have yet begun. Cluster Education Officer, Uri, Sarfaraz Khan is concerned: "The government should auction razed sites to builders. This will expedite task of reconstruction. How long can we expect children to study in the open or in temporary shelters? One day they will lose the motivation to study." At least 70 posts of teachers are lying vacant in the Uri zone, where several primary schools have one teacher against 200 students or more.

Major Nasir said there were 93 helicopter sorties on Friday, bringing food and supplies and evacuating hundreds of injured survivors. The aircraft came from Pakistan as well as Germany, Switzerland and the US.\n\nA moderate aftershock rattled the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, early on Friday, causing people to run out of their homes for fear of buildings collapsing. The short jolt measured 5.0 on the Richter scale, according to the US Geological Survey, and had an epicentre 130 kilometres north of the capital. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage. "We felt a shock and it was not a big one, but we and some other people in our street did rush out," Arif Saeed, a 43-year-old lawyer and father of three, said in Islamabad. He said he was relieved by television reports that the aftershocks were releasing seismic tension and reducing the chance of a larger quake.\n\nMany buildings in northern Pakistan that were not destroyed by the quake have been left in a perilous condition, leading to fears that aftershocks could bring teetering walls and roofs crashing down. President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz attended special prayers for victims after regular prayers on Friday, the Muslim holy day.\n\nMosques have been encouraging the faithful to contribute whatever money and goods they can to their brethren in Kashmir and the North West Frontier Province, where more than a million were made homeless and lack even basic shelter. The forecast for the region at the foot of the Himalayas 48 hours from Friday evening was isolated thunderstorms followed by a cold snap that will bring night-time temperatures to as low as three degrees. Meteorological officials said there were 70 aftershocks in a 24-hour period between Wednesday and Thursday, and the seismic activity was likely to continue for months, maybe years.

The number of injured has also been raised to 62,000, he said.\n\nThe UN\'s chief emergency relief co-ordinator, Jan Egeland, called for a more urgent world aid response. He said there was still a shortage of helicopters needed to reach remote villages. There had been an outpouring of support and an enormous wave of sympathy, he said, but added: "I would like to see it being even more quick, this response. "This is a very major earthquake, but it\'s really aggravated a thousand times by the topography. An earthquake is bad anywhere; in the Himalayas it becomes much worse."\n\nThe army has been airdropping supplies to villages cut off from help in remote valleys in the Himalayan foothills. Where valleys are too narrow and steep for helicopters, mule trains are being sent to carry in food, blankets and tents. But for the villagers, mules and airdrops were a temporary and unsatisfactory step — they wanted assurances they were not going to be cut off for the winter. Abdul Hamid, a district elder who walked four days and nights to Muzaffarabad from the Neelum valley, said the damage was not severe but food and supplies were running out. "We are very worried about how we can come in and out through the winter. The snows are on the mountain already and if we are cut off, thousands will die for sure."\n\nThe dangerous work of clearing the road was slow and painstaking, with many cars and buses buried in landslides and new ones easily set off, threatening untouched villages below. With about five kilometres of a 50-kilometre stretch of road blocked, and work moving at the pace of about 50 metres every four hours, that meant 400 hours of clearing ahead. In Muzaffarabad, the relief effort was kicking into gear. Ten trucks packed with aid supplies headed out of the city on Friday, this time with four or five armed guards each. Earlier convoys were swarmed and looted before leaving, feeding anger in remote areas that no relief was reaching them.\n\nWhile rescue efforts in Pakistani Kashmir were winding down, British rescuers in Islamabad still believed they might find people alive in the collapsed 10-storey apartment building Margalla Towers, the only significant damage in the city. "We are only here because we believe we may find somebody alive," says Anthony Thomas, a member of the Rapid UK rescue team. Thirty people are still missing and 47 people died.

The epicentre of the quake, 95 kilometres north-east of Islamabad, has since the 1980s been home to training camps for Islamic militants. The town of Mansehra, a long-time hub of terrorist training that was visited by one of the men responsible for London\'s July 7 bombings, was badly hit by the quake. At the forefront of the relief response has been an organisation called the Jama\'at ul Dawa (JUD), considered a charitable front for the notorious Lashkar-e-Toiba terrorist group, which was banned by the Pakistani Government in 2002 but still operates. JUD was put on the Government\'s terrorism watch list in 2003.\n\nSome reports say the JUD\'s field hospitals are better than the army\'s, boasting X-ray machines and pathology labs. Estimates of the number of volunteers begin in the thousands. A prominent member of the JUD relief effort is Dr Amir Aziz Khan, arrested on suspicion of al-Qaeda links but later released.\n\nMilitants are also reportedly taking orphaned children under their wing for indoctrination in holy war in their extensive network of orphanages. Offering work to some of the 1 million people estimated by the International Labour Organisation to have lost their livelihoods due to the quake will probably be another route to recruitment. All of which places the military ruler, Pervez Musharraf, in a tight spot. His government acknowledges JUD\'s good works and denies it is exploiting the disaster. Yet visiting the region with the United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, on Friday, he felt compelled to warn the victims to be wary of help from militants. "If someone shows extremism here, you should rise up against it," he said.\n\nLeaked reports from India\'s Intelligence Bureau have called a wave of terrorist violence in Indian-controlled Kashmir since the quake a virtual recruiting drive. Having displayed their compassion, Lashkar-e-Toiba\'s fedayeen death squads have been told to display their valour, say reports quoting confessions from arrested militants. Pakistani governments in the past have suffered backlashes when disaster relief proved inadequate. A cyclone in the Bay of Bengal in 1970 preceded East Pakistan\'s becoming Bangladesh.\n\nSince the quake, the Government has been criticised for everything from the penchant of the Prime Minister, Shaukat Aziz, for expensive suits to the decision a few days after the quake to spend $US1 billion on Swedish-made military aircraft. The $US5 billion-plus pledged by foreign donors for quake relief is embarrassingly close to the amount Islamabad was planning to pay the US for a large fleet of F-16 fighter jets.

Mazari was referring to the offer by India of helicopters for relief efforts.\n\nTranslated, these reports and comments, for the first time, amount to nearly transparent third party comments about Pakistan continuing to use terrorism as an instrument of foreign policy. Such revelations have, heretofore, never seen the light of day.\n\nIn fact, Western intelligence sources have been quoted as being aware that many of the terrorist camps in Pakistan occupied Kashmir continue to nurture and train Al Qaeda terrorists besides jhadis who cross the Line of Control to kill both civilians (often Muslims) and Indian Army personnel.\n\nWith schools destroyed, madarssas beckon\n\nDespite the foregoing, a clutch of Western commentary in the US and Europe has centered on the need to nudge India and Pakistan further along the peace process with the quake forming the basis of the new impetus.\n\nApart from the astounding moral equivalence implied, such decades old thinking continues to ignore the democratic deficit in Pakistan that has contributed not only to the enduring plight of average Pakistani citizens but also to the growing worldwide terrorist threat.\n\nThe Indian government would do well to publicly, if subtly, highlight development in the entire state of Kashmir including the contrast between infrastructure and responses on either side of the LoC. Along the same lines of affected impartiality, Western media and, in particular, the New York Times has focused on reports of supposedly inadequate responses by the Indian government. Presumably that was intended to suggest an impartial assessment that necessarily has to fault both countries.\n\nIn reality, these reports rely on skewed data designed to feed the false sense of even-handedness. The rapid response by the Indian Air Force to affected areas in Uri and elsewhere ought to be showcased by the government at every available avenue as an instance of what actually occurred on the ground.\n\nQuake in Pakistan: The sequel\n\nLastly, the absurdity of a suggested settlement, reflecting the aspirations of ordinary Kashmiris, between a military regime and a democratic and accountable government, seems to have eluded observers in the West.\n\nWhile India has surely gained time in going along with the peace process, Indians are aware that there is little likelihood of substantive settlement while both the military and terrorists (if a distinction can be made between the two) continue to shape Pakistan's national and foreign policy goals.\n\nGeneral Musharraf's praise of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's offer of aid notwithstanding there is no hint of any tangible move in the direction of peace. It is unlikely that brownie points from someone intent only on one-upmanship, if not destruction of his opponent, will accrue to India's benefit.\n\nThe government could consider lifting a page out of Israel and Ariel Sharon's book when the latter refused to deal with Yasser Arafat to the very end. Both the preceding Indian government and the present one have done nothing to insist on a democratic counter-party across the border.\n\nLet Pakistan not set the agenda!\n\nShockingly, the present government, in fact, has taken to tacit if not open engagement of terrorist leaders in Kashmir whose stock-in-trade is bullets not ballots. If some of the above sounds like exploiting a natural calamity it is meant to. After all, good governance does include the perception amongst the governed that theirs is the best that votes can get.\n\nFor millions of ordinary Pakistanis votes have historically meant nothing while their military continually leaves them deprived of the ability to control their destiny.

What lessons have they learnt and what type of business continuity planning have they in place to ensure that their business continues without substantial downtime? Anything that can go wrong, will\n\n\x96 Murphy\x92s Law A major disaster like the tsunami in Tamil Nadu, the Mumbai floods or the Kashmir earthquake makes headlines due to their dramatic and sensational nature. However, there are many disasters that are low profile in nature but have far reaching effects on business organisations\x97large and small. Contemporary business lives under the sword of disaster, and the larger the organisation the more it has to lose. Smaller businesses suffer more because they are unable to absorb losses and respond to sudden downtime. This downtime can be due to anything from natural or man-made disasters like earthquakes, fire, floods, tornados, terrorist attacks, etc., or it can be an extended power loss, telecom failure or air-conditioning failure. Life Under The Sword DR today means not just restoring data and system access after an unscheduled downtime. It means having in place a well-planned and tested method of anticipating and responding to any eventuality which leads to downtime. The focus has shifted from reactive to proactive planning, and narrows down to preventing downtime from happening at all. Even at the global level, the focus has shifted from DR, which concentrates only on the IT department, to Business Continuity Planning (BCP), which covers the entire business perspective including the business processes as well as skilled manpower responsible for running the business. It is universally acknowledged that BCP is a costly and complex process. It needs the co-operation and co-ordination of the entire business organisation. It asks uncomfortable and embarrassing questions about business processes, and requires thorough understanding of all critical business processes and how downtime will affect each process and the organisation as a whole. The worst part is that it does not have any immediate business benefit. However, those who have it in place know from experience that a well-planned BCP pays for its high cost after the first or second use. Lessons From Hard Knocks Business organisations have learnt their lesson from the Tamil Nadu tsunami and Mumbai floods. The results are either investments in disaster recovery sites or development of comprehensive BCP. Some organisations have also outsourced DR to ensure business continuity in case of a major disaster. \x93It is necessary to have generators and UPS on elevated platforms. The DR site or data centre too must be elevated, otherwise it becomes vulnerable to flooding,\x94 says Sanjay Sharma, Head, IT, IDBI Bank. It is also necessary to build fuel capacity in-house for the generators. There must be a backup for at least 12 hours. It is also essential to have standby generators in place. Many organisations had tried to procure diesel or petrol from petrol pumps during the recent disasters. However, the pumps were not working due to power failure, so a manual hand-pump had to be used and the fuel had to be manually transported as no other transportation was available because of the floods. This scenario will repeat again when another major disaster strikes with the likelihood of even the DR sites going down. Organisations were under the assumption that during a disaster they would be able to fly in people from other locations to the DR site, but during the Mumbai floods even the airport was non-functional. The Mumbai floods can be labelled as a partial disaster because the flooding took place only during the late noon hours. Most of the people were already at work and so the DR site was already operating. However, it has now been realised that the DR site has to be working 24x7x365/6 to tackle a full-fledged disaster, and that it is necessary to have an active DR site operated by dedicated staff. Sunil Gupta, Head, Product Management & Business Operations (IDC) of Reliance Infocomm says that despite the heavy rains and power failure of 26/7, the Reliance Infocomm data centre was fully functioning. This is because the level-3 data centre\x92s roofs were waterproof and prevented water from entering server halls. Sand bags were deployed at key points to prevent water from entering the campus, and de-watering pumps were used to remove water from the power substation outside the data centre building. Diesel generators were activated to prevent any power outage from the main grids, and enough diesel was stored to run the facility for three days without the need of fuel from outside. The Reliance Infocomm data centre is claimed to be resistant to natural disasters like flood, earthquakes and lightning, and even man-made disasters like power failure and riots. IDBI: Revolving around awareness Sanjay Sharma While it is good to have a strong BCP and DR site, it is also necessary to create a DR/BC-aware organisation. For this, training is given to people when they join the organisation. Training is provided about the infrastructure in place, the solution that has been opted for, the impact of the solution on the business, and most importantly, the impact of the solution not being available on time. The bank\x92s users are also aware of the function that will be first affected by disasters (for instance, anywhere banking or channels), and what the time gap is before the DR site takes over from the main data centre. A training programme is also present for senior-level management (such as cluster heads and zonal heads) to make them aware what they are expected to do to tackle disasters. IDBI\x92s DR Tech IDBI\x92s primary site is at Mumbai while the DR site is at Chennai. \x93The Chennai infrastructure will be able to take 100 percent load of the primary data centre in Mumbai,\x94 says Sanjay Sharma, Head of IT at IDBI Bank. This is significant because if the DR sites take lesser load than the primary centre even by 10 percent, then as the business volume grows there might be issues; when disaster strikes, the organisation might not be able to operate from the DR site. \x93We are working with IBM for the new data centre and have the IBM P-590 series put in place at both the DR and primary sites. We use SD-8300 storage boxes as well as lots of other products and tools that will automate the disaster recovery process,\x94 reveals Sharma. IDBI uses a hot DR concept and 100 percent replication takes place between the Mumbai and Chennai sites. The sites are connected by broadband links, and the replication takes place on a regular basis. Activation Responsibility Though the disaster recovery policy is well-defined, the bank faced the issue as to who will officially declare that disaster has struck, and who will take the decision that the DR site has to be activated. People who operate the site may make mistakes, so an automated DR process was put in place; consequently, when an event takes place the DR site is activated. The option of manual activation is retained. Once it is officially declared, the concerned person has to run certain options and key in the proper commands to activate the DR site. The bank has a high-speed link between the DR site and the primary site, and an alternate route for each path of the link so that if one link goes offline the other is available. Network symmetry is ensured so that when the primary site goes down the secondary site takes over without any complication from the perspective of network connectivity. Getting Priorities Straight DR is a subset of BCP. \x93You have to describe how business continuity is achieved. Create the DR site, create the information structure and IT platforms. But even though everything may be automated, some intelligent process is required at local branch levels,\x94 says Sharma. According to him, when you talk about BCP you also talk about technology and business-related issues, and see how you will operate the branch in case of a disaster. Hence, BCP is combination of technology, non-technology, manual processes and other external dependencies. Not all functions, products or categories of operations can be treated at par. The applications and business processes have to be classified into different categories like platinum, gold and silver since set-up and maintenance of DR infrastructure is an expensive process. The RTO/RPO (Recovery Time/Point Objectives) varies depending on the risk associated with each application and the type of risk carried with that application. Organisations have to constantly ponder what is the affordable downtime for the process or business function. \x93In an effective DR and BCP, every function of the business is included so you can\x92t ignore anything. You have to see what is more critical and pay more attention to that first,\x94 stresses Sharma. According to him, there will always be gaps in RPO. It cannot be zero due to its prohibitively expensive nature. In fact, it may be even more than the cost of the data loss due to the disaster. Clearly, the organisation has to balance between cost and RTO/RPO. The DR Wish list Sanjay Sharma, IT Head of IDBI Bank, feels that in theory heterogeneous systems talk to each other, but in reality different vendor-based solutions are not compatible. Although some high-end systems provide heterogeneity, it is not always easy. Sharma\x92s biggest wish is that heterogeneous systems should talk to each other irrespective of the vendor, who makes them, and no matter what application or infrastructure is being used. The cost of bandwidth should also become more reasonable. Remote manageability of solutions should be more mature. High-end systems have the option of zero downtime, and can replace any part or component without any shutdown. But there are constraints there as well. Further, scripts should be automated and they should work with the RPO and RTO. C N Ram, Head, IT, HDFC Bank, feels that the software that is used to replicate data must work seamlessly across diverse geographical locations. There must be different software designs put in place to replicate data instantly. Towards Active DR Instead of having a passive DR activated only during drills or an actual disaster, it is best to create an active DR site whereby the organisation can run queries from the DR site and balance operations between the DR and primary site. This will result in the optimum utilisation of resources deployed at the DR site, and node balancing between the DR and primary site. Whenever there is a disaster or crisis, effectiveness of the DR site is tested. Factors include the magnitude of the disaster and whether people can work during it. Inputs can be obtained from the customers or users of the channels to find out the problems they face. Audits are done at regular intervals to know how effectively the DR site works. \x93As the new infrastructure for DR between Mumbai and Chennai is ready, we intend to do dry runs at least once a month. The frequency will depend on factors like the impact it has on the business, branch operations and various channels. In reality, no dry run can be with zero downtime,\x94 emphasises Sharma. Anticipation And Assessment Every business and process has potential risks. \x93We are Basel II compliant so we constantly review the operational risks and do methodological risk assessment. It is then quantified and measured in terms of loss of data because of that particular operation,\x94 informs Sharma. Risk is associated with every process and software. It has to be assessed how much business loss occurs due to downtime and the resulting business impact. It is then translated into the risk factor. Higher business impact risk factors are given higher DR priority and more sophisticated infrastructure is dedicated to them. The lower the business impact, the lower is the risk, so a different type of treatment is given for the DR scenario or BCP plan. This is an elaborate exercise. Threats from external sources include somebody trying to crack your site and affecting the reputation of the company or the finances of the company. Each threat is converted into a risk. When real disasters strike, in spite of risk and threat assessment, the things that actually happen are usually beyond expectation. That\x92s why proper BCP and DR plans must be available in each zone to co-ordinate with the user because during this period panic and anxiety levels among users are high. Currently, everything is managed from a centralised environment and the branch is only a virtual branch. For each activity or business process, the DR planning or BCP can be done, and it is possible to find out what the local impact is. It is also possible to calculate how a branch operation will be impacted. External threats can be prevented to some extent by Internet banking, having DMZ (demilitarised zone), firewalls, patch upgradation, etc. Even ethical hacking can be done by external vendors to evaluate the organisation\x92s belief in its infrastructure security. Internal threats can be due to misuse of rights, intent of employees to take away company data with them, misuse of access to obtain information which a person is not supposed to, or having access rights on too many systems. Once the change management system is in place, it mitigates many risks, hence all this helps define how you counter internal and external threats. A BCP must have the following steps\x97analyse the business, assess the risk, develop the DR and other strategies, develop actual DR and business continuity plan, and finally keep on rehearsing the plan. Having a BCP not only helps reduce financial loss and loss of marketshare, it also protects assets including employees, and reduces or prevents bad publicity. Fighting Fit V Babu, DGM, IT, Bank of India, on the DR/BC strategies that Bank of India relies on According to the Reserve Bank of India\x92s (RBI) guidelines, it is imperative for every banking and financial institution to have a disaster recovery plan in place. Banks are still in the process of framing a BCP, but they have to be ready to tackle serious business disruptions. V Babu, Deputy GM, IT Department, Bank of India, feels it makes more business sense to outsource their DR and BCP management. Consequently, the organisation is able to focus on its core competencies and provide a better banking experience to its customers. DR Works Price Waterhouse Coopers was consulted for DR, and the strategy is updated every year. \x93The DR site for core banking is at Bangalore, and it is provided for by HP,\x94 says Babu. HP has built and is managing the data centre, disaster recovery site, help desk and call centre for Bank of India. DR awareness among the employees as well as top-level management staff is necessary. This is achieved through the information security policy as well as the DR set-up of the organisation. The DR plan is basically implemented in three stages. For the core banking services the DR site is at Bangalore. For non-core banking services there are dual servers and tape backups. A testing cycle is implemented every month to ensure that the data on the tape can be restored properly. \x93Auditing the DR site is an ongoing process. The information system audit group goes and audits all branches and the necessary review is done. The reports are then presented to the IT department to rectify any fault in the system,\x94 says Babu. As the DR plan is based on industry standards, all potential risks and threats are taken into account and assessed. Even during the Mumbai floods of 26/7, the ATMs were functioning properly and most branches were running normally. There was no major issue due to the DR plan and DR awareness among the employees. The reliance on DR Sunil Gupta, Head, Product Management and Business Operations (IDC), Reliance Infocomm on the organisation\x92s DR/BC strategy \x93Our DR set-up consists of a highly redundant data centre. The primary site in Mumbai has never experienced a power failure in the last five years. Even the air conditioners and other systems never fail. The data centre is prepared for the eventuality whereby even if all of Mumbai or Maharashtra does not have power for days, it will not be affected,\x94 says Sunil Gupta, Head, Product Management and Business Operations (IDC), Reliance Infocomm. To make a call at the time of disaster is critical for the customer and this is when the real need of a service is felt. As a telecom provider, infrastructure hosting critical applications has to be robust. The primary site in Mumbai and the Bangalore DR centre are built with level 3 specifications to withstand earthquakes floods and lightning. There is no single point of failure either at the primary or the DR site in Bangalore. All critical applications have a parallel set-up at Bangalore. As the data in Mumbai is on a SAN, SAN-to-SAN replication is done and if the data is lost or the server is down, it is available at the DR site due to replication using high capacity links. Classifying Applications For DR \x93For critical applications, the replication is done in real-time at Mumbai itself. A three-way DR recovery concept is used. Another DR site or data centre is set up at Mumbai itself. It is used to store any information, function or process for which a delay is not acceptable. Hence a second copy is available at the Mumbai DR site and a third at the DR site in Bangalore,\x94 explains Gupta. If data, process or application is not critical, then a warm DR recovery concept is implemented. The application is still running at the other end (Bangalore DR site) and data replication occurs in a batch mode every hour or every day as the case may be. In addition to all this there is also a cold site for storing the data. This is to cover the unlikely scenario where both the primary and the DR site go down. In such a scenario, it is still possible to recover the data from the cold site. Hence, application classification is done depending on the type of data or process and its impact on business, and customers. The NNOC DR Being a telecom company, Reliance Infocomm also has a huge network operation centre where people work on a 24X7 basis. The company\x92s main business is that of a service provider. To handle situations where the NNOC (National Network Operations Centre) is not operational, a parallel NNOC has been set up at Hyderabad. It can take over operations without any service getting affected. Infrastructure And DR Operations At the primary site, all databases are stored on a SAN that has a capacity of more than 500 terabytes which is claimed to be the biggest in India. In storage also, concepts like BCV (business continuity volumes) are used. First, there are servers that are redundant, then a server cluster, the data is then kept on the SAN and a SAN BCV is performed. The data kept on tape is constantly restored on different systems to check if the restoration is successful or not and whether the data is still the same. This process of tape backup and restoration is done on a regular basis. However the frequency differs depending on the priority as well as the nature of the data. A Well-Defined BCP Reliance Infocomm has two certifications\x97ISO 9000:2000 and BS 7799. There are audits for every aspect of the infrastructure. This includes not just the IT resources but also the processes governing them. Processes are available for audits, mock drills, physical resources, logical assets like backup storage, firewalls and the DR site. Due to the BS 7799 certification, the organisation has well-defined written processes. The documentation is also comprehensive and covers 50 manuals. For every activity the company follows ITIL processes\x97be it training, design, implementations, change management, event management, or troubleshooting processes. Similarly, as the organisation has a full-fledged DR plan and a security policy, it has helped it define every possible disaster from the macro perspective as well as from the micro one. The macro perspective includes natural disasters like earthquakes, floods, lightening and even man-made ones such as terrorism and riots. The micro level perspective can be server crashes or system data getting corrupted. Every eventuality is covered with well-defined written procedures and the action plans to adopt in worst-case scenarios. \x93Though the Mumbai and Bangalore data centres are redundant due to mandatory provision, we do dry runs every week and shut off the power from the grid and run the DR site to ensure that it is working properly,\x94 says Gupta. Every area and procedure from customer provisioning to customer support, call centre activities to network components and backend applications supporting them are included in the DR and BC plan. All services related to service provisioning, service support, operations and customer support are included in the scope of DR and all are run on the hot site or warm site concept. The surrounding administrative functions, which include sales and HR are also covered by DR. In short all applications, processes are well defined and categorised according to the priority and gets DR treatment accordingly. DR Infrastructure The organisation uses an EMC solution for a SAN-to-SAN replication. HP OpenView is used for network management to provide a view of the network across the entire country. Tools are used for network redundancy and network DR. There are customer and vendor-specific tools to give access to servers hosted anywhere in the country. For instance, in the event of a disaster in Mumbai, the Bangalore team can access those servers and manage it from there. DR Awareness As a part of ISO and BS 7799 certification compliance, each and every person working in the IDC building is trained for fire-fighting, how to respond to disasters and how to provide support. The DR process is available on the portal and people are trained in the process. The company also has to report every six months to the certification body that people have been trained and retrained on this process. The refresher course is conducted at regular intervals. Surprise mock drills are carried out to check the response time and readiness of the people involved in supporting the DR site. Banking on BCP C N Ram, IT Head, HDFC Bank on how the bank deals with crises C N Ram C N Ram feels that given the current business scenario, DR has become a part of the overall business continuity planning process. The function of DR is to preserve data and prevent loss of customer and service related data. This can be handled by the IT department. However, during a disaster many other business processes and departments are impacted, so a sound BCP involves processes as well as people who are skilled and capable of taking over and maintaining the DR site on a regular basis. The primary site of HDFC Bank is in Mumbai, while the DR site is in Chennai\x97both for the system and operations. Optimum utilisation is done at the DR site by undertaking load balancing. The work is split between both the primary and DR sites. So, people on both sites are familiar with the DR process, can takeover and manage during periods of downtime. The DR site is online and data from the banking system is replicated on the DR site within 15 to 30 minutes depending on traffic delay in the transmission lines. Processes Covered All corporate and retail banking system are covered in the organisation\x92s DR and BCP. \x93We have an ATM switch which is Basel II-complaint. There is an identical system in Chennai. All ATMs are connected to the Chennai DR site in case of failure of the primary site,\x94 says Ram. The entire retail, wholesale banking system, cash management are also covered in DR. Periodic trials of the ATM switches are conducted every six months. Though Chennai has its own share of disasters, it is still preferred as a DR site by most organisations. This is because of good infrastructure, availability of proper vendor support and availability of skilled manpower to maintain the DR site and real estate is inexpensive. 26/7 Mumbai Floods HDFC had some problems during the Mumbai floods especially with the telecom links that snapped at many places. Only the Reliance telecom network was working. There was also the issue of power failures. Some ATMs were totally cut off due to flooding and the agencies hired to replenish the cash at the ATMs could not do so. However, the data centre was totally operational. Ram feels that proper DR and business continuity planning is the key to a successful DR and BCP implementation. The DR and BCP should include all the business processes and people necessary to keep the IT resources working during the disaster and protect the data and system. The company should maintain the business continuity in such a way that the customer feels that the organisation is still in normal operation mode.', 'title': 'Prepared for the worst', 'url': 'http://www.networkmagazineindia.com/200512/coverstory03.shtml', 'keywords': ['disaster', 'site', 'mumbai', 'business', 'bcp', 'dr', 'prepared', 'data', 'primary', 'process', 'centre', 'worst'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Disaster Recovery/Business Continuity Prepared for the worst Kumar Dawada brings you insights into how the banking and telecom sectors have faced the major disasters that have affected India recently.\nIDBI\x92s DR Tech IDBI\x92s primary site is at Mumbai while the DR site is at Chennai.\nThis will result in the optimum utilisation of resources deployed at the DR site, and node balancing between the DR and primary site.\nHence a second copy is available at the Mumbai DR site and a third at the DR site in Bangalore,\x94 explains Gupta.\nAll ATMs are connected to the Chennai DR site in case of failure of the primary site,\x94 says Ram.', 'date': 1337472000}, {'text': 'By Dominic Casciani\n\nBBC News community affairs\n\n\n\nAlthough the earthquake in Kashmir has dropped out of most of the news, many volunteers are still working in the field, trying to save the lives of villagers who have lost their homes -and may lose more with the onset of winter.\n\nImran Saithna, a young British-Pakistani, has just returned to London after spending three weeks working in an area of Kashmir that had no contact with the outside world after the earthquake hit.\n\nWith no professional background in emergency relief, Imran like many others took a chance on getting a flight to Islamabad to see if agencies could make use of them.\n\nPeople back home want to know why I\'m out there doing what we\'re doing\n\nWesley Olson, volunteer\n\nIn depth: South Asia quake\n\nAlong with the rest of his team, they hired a couple of lorries, filled them with supplies and headed off into the mountains of the Bargh District, one of the high areas the major agencies had not reached.\n\nAfter six hours of driving and another four hours of back-breaking trekking on foot over mountainous valleys, says Imran, the team found the village of Surrell - a settlement 11,000 feet up and home to perhaps 3,500 people.\n\nVolunteers: International teams working in Kashmir\n\n"When we got there we saw that the earthquake had destroyed virtually every structure. The villagers had received no aid at all -no help with food, no help with shelter. There were kids who desperately needed medical help, people with open wounds which had not been treated. No one had been up there at all."\n\nThe scenes shocked Imran and the rest of the team. It was not just the scale of the devastation - but also the simple fact that these people effectively did not exist as far as aid efforts go. Bodies had gone unburied, livestock killed by the quake lay rotting in fields. Pneumonia and other disaster-related illnesses were apparent.\n\nBut while the media had done its job in the immediate aftermath covering aid efforts in major centres such as Muzzaffrabad, there were countless settlements like Surrell which were receiving no help at all.\n\nVolunteering: Some of Imran\'s pictures from Pakistan.\n\nIn pictures\n\n\n\nWith snows of up to three metres expected, many people like the villagers of Surrell remain today in the open. They are caught between freezing to death in what remains of their mountain homes - or losing their livelihoods and means of survival by leaving their settlements behind.\n\n"People desperately needed shelters - they were absolutely scared of anything made of concrete because it had been the concrete that had collapsed and killed so many," says Imran. "Tin or wood roofs and floors had survived - but we had no means to build more of those, so we had to try something else."\n\nRemains: Children\'s study books destroyed in the quake\n\nAmerican Wesley Olson was among the other international volunteers who found his way to the same valley.\n\nOriginally from Los Angeles, Wesley had been travelling around India when the quake struck. He headed for Pakistan and is still there, furiously buying up thousands of bori bags to drive up to remote settlements. Like many volunteers, he is frustrated with the drying up of media interest.\n\n"I think there are a lot of people who have arrived here who just want to give something back from their travels," he says via satellite phone. "I know of at least three or four people who came up from India to help out.\n\n"People back home want to know why I\'m out there doing what we\'re doing, they have seen the pictures of the aid in the towns. But we\'re here because 90% of houses have been flattened. I came here for two weeks thinking I could help out by answering phones but it then really took off."\n\nWarning\n\nBut volunteering does have its drawbacks. Mahmood Hassan of British charity Islamic Aid and chairman of the Pakistan Development Network, said the organisation had been flooded with offers of help in the days after the quake. But unless someone has a specific skill to offer, or knowledge of an area, good intentions can be wasted he warns.\n\n"Our official policy is to try as much as possible to use local people," says Mr Hassan. "In these kinds of situations people can spend more than £1,000 getting somewhere to try and help and then find they don\'t know what they are doing. That £1,000 could be better spent by people in the field with the contacts and the structures to get things done."\n\nPakistani families spread around the world, particularly in the UK, have been moved to go because they know the area well and believe they can help, he says.\n\nWhile this kind of volunteering can be useful, says Mr Hassan, the real problem is when someone flies in for a very short period of time.\n\n"We\'ve had a shortage of doctors and surgeons. But it takes a few days on arrival to acclimatise and get things going. If people with skills volunteer in these situations the situation we must avoid is someone having very little time to do anything on arrival before they have to leave."', 'title': 'Rebuilding site', 'url': 'http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4480660.stm', 'keywords': ['site', 'know', 'imran', 'doing', 'working', 'aid', 'volunteers', 'help', 'try', 'team', 'rebuilding', 'villagers'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Volunteers: International teams working in Kashmir"When we got there we saw that the earthquake had destroyed virtually every structure.\nThe villagers had received no aid at all -no help with food, no help with shelter.\nThere were kids who desperately needed medical help, people with open wounds which had not been treated.\n"People back home want to know why I\'m out there doing what we\'re doing, they have seen the pictures of the aid in the towns.\nI came here for two weeks thinking I could help out by answering phones but it then really took off."', 'date': 1133260319}, {'text': 'View a 360-degree panorama of Muzaffarabad\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 100,000 homes were destroyed in the city, and residents fear that proper shelter and medical supplies will not arrive before the harsh winter sets in.\n\nAs part of the link-up children from schools in the British city of Bradford put their questions to people in Muzaffarabad.\n\nRead on to find out more about the plight of some of those in Muzaffarabad, and about the Bradford children who took part in the link-up.\n\nChildren in Muzaffarabad\'s front line\n\nBy Neil Arun\n\nBBC News, Muzaffarabad\n\n\n\nAwaiz Asmat had expected to receive a new pair of shoes for Eid this year, replacing his tattered old trainers.\n\nMusarrad still mourns with her two surviving sons, Mohsen (l) and Ahsaan (r)\n\nBarely days before the big festival, his mother watched as those old trainers were drawn from the rubble of the school, along with the crushed body of her 12-year-old son.\n\nA final burial was arranged four weeks after he died for a boy who had impressed his teachers with his memory of the Koran and infuriated his mother with demands for sweet cola drinks and a precocious taste for chewing tobacco.\n\n"At least now I have a grave I can pray at," says his mother, Musarrad, tears streaming down her face.\n\nThe family says it lost nine members - mostly children - to the earthquake that levelled this city four weeks ago, at the onset of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.\n\nIn shock\n\nMUZAFFARABAD QUAKE IMPACT Pakistan death toll: 73,276 Death toll in Muzaffarabad district: 33,724 Population of Muzaffarabad district in 2002: 833,000 Children killed by quake: 17,000 Sources: Unicef; local government\n\nDetailed map of quake zone\n\nMusarrad says she has nothing to live for - her husband died a decade ago and the sewing school she worked in to support her family was destroyed in the quake.\n\nShe rests her head on the younger of her two surviving sons, Ahsaan.

A day on, police and emergency services were no where in sight. Thousands were injured, mostly women and children who were in their homes at the time of the disaster, while their men worked in the open. Almost every second woman or child bore an injury. At the private Shaheen School, another 650 children were trapped inside the four-storey building that collapsed. Parents said they could hear the cries of children, but were helpless until they managed to get makeshift rescue equipment, including iron bars they used to lever away rubble. The Balakot region is a scene of massive devastation. Perhaps half of the concrete houses have collapsed and dozens of bodies lay in the open. Residents complained about the lack of help. The road into the town has been blocked by landslides, and it is only possible to reach the town on foot. A Reuters reporter counted 105 bodies on the eight-kilometre (five-mile) trek into town. Some bodies were laid out by the roadside by relatives hoping for help with their burial. Others were carried on charpoys, or traditional rope beds.

The work however does not stop for some. The office assistants are still beavering away - and also debating some of the questions sent in by BBC users. The director, Dr Abdulkarim Khalil is dashing to a meeting elsewhere. The final prayers will take place at 7pm - before the cycle begins again in the morning.\n\n\n\nDr Abdulkarim Khalil - a final question for the director\n\n\n\nSusan K Kelly in Blackpool, UK, asks: "Do you feel that you have enriched the life and culture of the indigenous British people? If you feel that you have could you please explain how you feel this has been achieved?"\n\nDr Khalil says: "I feel that our centre and its Islamic ethos is enriching society, perhaps in a limited way because we are a relatively young organisation.\n\n"We believe we contribute to understanding by helping British society understand Islamic values, for instance through our cultural awareness training and activities such as art exhibitions and performances here and in the wider community. Earlier this year we had a week-long major exhibition on Islam which attracted a lot of interest from non-Muslims, especially schools.\n\n"Just through the centre\'s existence and community youth work, we believed we have had some impact, although limited, on reducing crime and anti-social behaviour in this area.\n\n"Islam has a very strong emphasis on family values. Society benefits if we bring up our children with strong understanding of what is right and what is wrong. I believe this is something our society needs because of the materialistic environment in which we live."\n\n1700: A nice cup of tea\n\nCouncillor Nick Paget-Brown, a senior Conservative councillor from the Borough of Kensington and Chelsea pops in for a cup of tea and a hello with Al-Manaar\'s management.\n\n"When the council gave its backing to the centre we did so because we hoped to achieve something beyond just religion. The faith is the business of the worshipper - that\'s not our place. But we hoped we could do something more for the community in terms of helping people become active citizens.\n\n"I think that this kind of community building depends on rethinking assumptions - think less about services for individual ethnicities and more about services that help people take a stake in their community. An important part of life is to be a contributing member of your wider community."\n\n\n\nDr Abdulkarim Khalil answers some of your questions\n\n\n\nA question for Al-Manaar\'s Libyan-born director from Chris Goodman in Portsmouth. Chris asks how Dr Khalil would about a \'Christian Council of Libya\' being set up in his home country?\n\nDr Khalil says: "Being a Muslim, I have an obligation to respect people of other faiths, especially those we know as \'people of the book\' - Jews and Christians. As it happens, Libya does not have a Christian community as such. But if there were one, I would have no problem with people setting up their own organisations which fulfil their aspirations - that is their natural right to do so. It has happened in other Arab countries, such as Egypt and Jordan."\n\nPaul Martin in Dallas,Texas, asks what activities take place in mosques which equate to events in Christian churches, such as fund raising for charity and opening their doors to the wider community.\n\nDr Khalil says: "Regular fund raising events take place in the mosque, especially in the month of Ramadan. Last Ramadan we raised about £20,000 for good causes around the world, including relief for the earthquake victims in Kashmir, money for orphans and widows in Palestine, rebuilding of families in Bosnia and so on.\n\n"We are also involved in many very small causes close to home, including recently providing the food for an Eid celebration for a woman\'s refuge in London [Eid is the festival at the end of the month of Ramadan].\n\n"Our mosque is used for lectures, workshops dealing with social issues like drug abuse, family breakdown and the inter-generational gap and health awareness.\n\nJust this week we have had the health services here giving flu jabs and information sessions on homecare for the elderly." "Our mosque is registered with the authorities to receive casualties in the event of a large civil incident, such as a major fire. We\'re part of what\'s known as the civil defence strategy for this part of London."\n\n1600: Education, education, education\n\nEducation is a key element of what happens at Al-Manaar - and one of the largest elements of this is the City Circle club on Saturdays.\n\nGalib, one of the volunteer teachers, jokes that his three hours a week with the kids has helped keep him sane in the very mad world of investment banking.\n\n"We say in Islam that Allah will never change the condition of people until they change what is in themselves," he says. "Education is right at the core of Islam - the chance to learn and understand both yourself and the world.\n\n"A lot of the kids we teach - Muslim and non-Muslim are from very deprived areas. The only way that you break out of that is by working very hard at school and getting the chance to go to university."\n\nA slight victim of its own success, the club is running out of space with 160 students now taking part and 50 volunteer teachers. There are great hopes to expand the scheme further, with two satellite schools in the East End and south London.\n\n\n\nAicha Manakova\n\n\n\nPerhaps the most unusual email of the day. Aisha Zouaoui asks: "I have been searching high and low for a translation of the Koran in the Czech language."\n\nAicha says: "There is a translation of the Koran in Czech - but I converted in England so have it in English and Arabic. But I do know of a website www.islamweb.cz which has contacts for the mosque in Prague and Brno. There\'s also a discussion group for Muslim sisters."\n\n1500: Angry young men?\n\nYusuf Dergoub works on the London Underground - he\'s one of the electricians who keeps the entire network going - or at least tries to keep it going. A young man, he\'s got a small Islamic-style beard and sometimes dresses in fairly traditional Moroccan/Arabic clothes.\n\nHe\'s angry because he feels some people now look on him as a terrorist suspect. Unsurprisingly, while he wants to talk, he is reluctant to be photographed. The media have damaged the position of Muslims in British society, he feels.\n\nSince the bombings journalists have come and gone from outside Al-Manaar and many of the congregation feel depressed with the way they have been treated. Many other mosques around Britain feel the same way.\n\n"The media sometimes says the things it wants to say but blacks out the things that it does not want to talk about," says Yusuf.\n\n"I\'m British and was born in the East End within sound of the Bow Bells. But the way the media portray me I\'m made out to be something different. All I am trying to do is follow something that I believe to be true."\n\n1430: Ask the imam\n\nSheikh Mansour Al-Ahmad answers some of your more theological questions\n\nCath Davis, Leigh, United Kingdom, asks if Muslims are required to convert people of other religions to their faith.\n\nSheikh Mansour says: "A Muslim has no duty to convert anyone to their religion - but they have a duty to ensure that his religion is properly expressed to others. He has no right to compel others to do as he does."\n\nTim Smith, United Kingdom, asks what Muslims would think about councils banning the word Christmas out of fear of offending Muslim residents.\n\nSheikh Mansour says: "I am shocked - I had not heard of this happening. This shouldn\'t happen. Every faith has its special occasions and we must all recognise this and respect one another."\n\nTanya Savrimootoo in London asks about verses of the Koran which detail horrible punishments for unbelievers, such as burning and so on. Tanya asks what is the imam\'s stance on these verses and how they are used by extremist groups.\n\nRelated questions from other readers ask about whether or not the Koran should be read literally or interpreted.\n\nSheikh Mansour says: "I am a Muslim and therefore I believe that non-Muslims are unbelievers. But that is the way with every religion - Christians will feel the same about me, they will regard Muslims as unbelievers. "The Koran is the word of God as revealed to the Prophet. But the verses of the Koran cannot be simple cut out and misused on their own - they have to be seen in context of the whole - and in how they relate to other verses."\n\nMatt in England asks what Muslims think of Jesus.\n\nSheikh Mansour says: "Jesus is one of the five great prophets along with Noah, Abraham, Moses and of course Mohammad. You cannot be a Muslim without believing in Jesus. The difference is that we see him as a prophet, not the son of God. We believe that the original scriptures of the old and new testaments were revealed by God - but over the ages they have been changed by human hand."\n\nJohn of Kings Lynn asks about relations with Jews.\n\nSheikh Mansour says: "It\'s a very big question. Jews for centuries lived in peace with Muslims - there are tales of Jews coming to seek refuge in Islamic lands. But the creation in 1948 of a Zionist state complicated things.\n\n"I believe that the two can live in peace - but at present not in a natural state. If the weak people, the Palestinians, are forced to do something they oppose, it may work, but it cannot last if it is unnatural."\n\n1330: After prayers\n\nMany people regard their local mosque as central to their daily life - and it\'s a place where they can discuss important issues.\n\nEman: "Don\'t make assumptions"\n\nRizwan Mirza is a solicitor from a Pakistani family. He says that Al-Manaar is different to many mosques because the congregation is so mixed. He says the media need to rethink how they talk about Muslims.\n\n"You can agitate people or be conducive. I\'m not saying that the media should not do its job, it just needs to be more responsible about what it said about Muslims."\n\nEman, a 21-year-old student, says she and her friends feel the rest of society completely misunderstands Muslim women.\n\n"The image that\'s portrayed of Muslim women is completely wrong. I\'m not oppressed, I\'m not forced to wear things like my hijab. It\'s my decision and people have to learn a little bit of respect. And I\'m not going to be changing."\n\n1300: Friday prayers\n\nSome 1,500 people have come to prayers, it\'s packed out in the main hall. Younger men rushing from work are the last to enter, sometimes after prayers have begun.\n\nSadeq, a volunteer, welcomes worshippers to Al-Manaar\n\nA good Muslim should remember always that there are also moral rules that guide their daily lives - rules that require them to do good and forbid evil. He said this should be at the core of their thinking every day.\n\nThe sermon is followed by prayers. The ritual itself is simple affair which creates an enormous sense of unity between those taking part; they stand shoulder to shoulder, bow, kneel and prostrate together in time. Often children sit at the back and follow their fathers and older brothers in the actions.\n\n1215: Prayer times\n\nFriday prayers are starting shortly - the most important part of the week for a mosque. Many of you have asked questions about how the prayer times are fixed and what happens if a Muslim misses a prayer?\n\nSheikh Ahmed Dahdouh says: "The prayer times relate to the position of the sun - when the sun is directly overhead, then it is time for the midday prayers. When the shadows double in length, then it is time for the "Asr" afternoon prayer. There is flexibility - these are recommended times for the start of prayers and the worshipper have a period of time in which to complete them. Prayers can also be combined, such as when people are travelling. If someone misses a prayer, we say try and pray as soon as possible."\n\nHomework club\n\nIt\'s been a busy morning from Dr Abdulkarim Khalil. Along with the centre\'s imam Sheikh Ahmed Dahdouh, he has been finalising a schedule for speakers at the Friday sermon for the coming nine months.\n\nOn top of that, the pair have been discussing a separate weekly lecture series on key Islamic issues, such as the life of the Prophet Mohammed, the meaning of the Koran and key areas of Islamic jurisprudence, the code of behaviour within the faith.\n\nBut on top of this, he is finalising a funding bid for Al-Manaar\'s homework club. This runs on Saturdays from 10am and up to 160 students take part. The programme includes one-to-one tuition and coaching through a network of 50 volunteers. Subjects include English, Maths, the sciences, French and IT, all to A Level standard.\n\nQuestions of identity\n\nA lot of the questions you are sending in relate to the idea of identity - questions are being asked throughout Europe about the position of Muslim minorities in western societies.\n\nGeorge Madden, Birmingham, United Kingdom asks: "Would you say you are Britons who happen to be Muslims, or Muslims who happen to live in Britain? Which is more important?"\n\nRupe Parnell, United Kingdom, asks: "For those in the panel who have British citizenship: Which do you see yourself as primarily - British or Islamic?"\n\nAnd Francois Apollon, Marseille, France, says: "Which is paramount - Islamic law and all that it requires of a Muslim, or, the secular laws of the nation you reside in?"\n\nSaleha says: "I\'m British and a Muslim, both at the same time, side by side - on top of all that I was actually born here.\n\n"I don\'t feel that there is a problem with being both at the same time because what you describe yourself as depends on the circumstances. Professor Tariq Ramadan [Swiss thinker on Islam] says that if you are a poet and a vegetarian, you say you are a vegetarian at a dinner and a poet at a reading.\n\n"I think people may ask these questions because they think there is a problem with loyalty - it\'s the question related to terrorism. They\'re asking where you loyalties lie - your religion or your nationality. Yet I see no problem with being Muslim and British."\n\n\n\nQuestions for Aicha Manakova\n\n\n\nAnne in Birmingham asks:\n\nWhen we see pictures on the television of people praying in mosques we only ever see men. Why are there no women? Where do Muslim women pray?\n\nAicha says: "Muslim women do pray in mosques - but they don\'t want their bodies to be seen as we do not want everybody to see our shape. Women who pray in mosques will mostly not want to be filmed."\n\nTony Nolan in London asks:\n\nWhy do converts to Islam change their name to something Arabic sounding? Is this a requirement of Islam?\n\nAicha says: "It\'s not a requirement of the faith - but in my case it gave me an identity that expressed my Muslim character which is something that was important to me. My original name was Martina - a third century Christian saint. Aicha was a wife of the Prophet."\n\nAn inspector calls\n\nInspector Tim Harding of the Metropolitan Police is a regular visitor to Al-Manaar. He\'s the head of a team of officers charged with creating "safe neighbourhoods", a Met strategy to create confidence on the ground and bring people closer together.\n\nHe is trying to find ways of building ties with the young and diverse congregation at Al-Manaar which includes people from many different backgrounds - North African, Middle Eastern, Somali and so on.\n\n"It\'s very important to make these links because we\'re trying to provide a police service for all of them," he says\n\n"A lot of crime happens that we don\'t get to hear about - such as hate crimes based on faith - we need to know about this so we can deal with it. We\'ve started looking at third-party reporting so that people can confidentially speak to people here if they don\'t want to talk to us directly."\n\nInsp Harding says neighbourhood work doesn\'t make the headlines - but is increasingly crucial in the wake of the London bombings.\n\n"The situation has made life a lot harder, without a doubt," he says. "The work we did prior to 7 July meant we had a lot of trust with the centre and with older generations. We need to work harder with the young people because many feel a huge pressure on them. We have to keep plodding on."\n\n10:00: A new day\n\nAl-Manaar opens its doors at 6am for the first prayers of the day when a caretaker and imam open up the hall for up to 150 people.\n\nIt\'s a quiet time of contemplation, not least because it\'s so early in the morning. The day starts proper after 9am when many of the staff start arriving.\n\nThis morning work has however come to a complete stop. The key members of staff are crowding around the computer screen in the office looking at the questions coming in from the public about the centre and Islam.\n\nJohn Emmett of Leighton Buzzard has asked an important opening question:\n\n"Are Christians allowed into Mosques as bystanders/observers, provided they act with respect and dignity - and respect dress rules etc? As a Christian myself, and having visited many parts of the Persian Gulf on business, (where I have been excluded from Mosques) I think it would be a good way encourage understanding of different beliefs."\n\n\n\nAbdulkarim Kubica\n\n\n\n"We\'re a founder member of the Forum of Faiths in this area - it\'s a representative body which includes the Church of England, Catholic Church, the Jewish faith, a Sikh Gurdwara temple and Buddhists. We focus on issues such as inclusion and standing together for the common good. We share knowledge and understanding for common goals."\n\nMosque basics\n\nMosques rarely, if ever, shut. Muslims are expected to pray five times a day - and prayers can be made anywhere as it is a simple ritual of following a number of sequential steps.\n\nBut if they can make it to a mosque, then they will go because the prayer hall is a place of coming together - but also somewhere they see as a simple space where they can think about their faith.\n\nWhile mosques can be incredibly ornate buildings, very often it is the prayer hall that is the simplest area. There are no seats as prayer begins when worshippers stand shoulder-to-shoulder together in the hall and face in the direction of Mecca.\n\nAn imam is the leader of prayer who stands at the front of the worshippers. Traditionally, anyone can be an imam but a general requirement is that the individual can recite Quranic verses to a high standard.\n\nPrayer halls are usually segregated: there are separate halls for men and women, although if there are not separate halls, there are rules which allow both sexes to share the same space.', 'title': 'Laptop link-up: A day at the mosque', 'url': 'http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk/4511780.stm', 'keywords': ['day', 'questions', 'mosque', 'asks', 'laptop', 'feel', 'mosques', 'work', 'linkup', 'prayer', 'muslims', 'prayers', 'muslim', 'think'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Amid widespread interest in Islam, the BBC News website hosted a live laptop link-up from one of the biggest mosques and community centres in London.\n1800: Wrapping upMost people have gone home - it\'s the end of a long and busy day at Al-Manaar.\nDr Khalil says: "Regular fund raising events take place in the mosque, especially in the month of Ramadan.\nMatt in England asks what Muslims think of Jesus.\n1215: Prayer timesFriday prayers are starting shortly - the most important part of the week for a mosque.', 'date': 1134152209}, {'text': "The lines were cut between the two areas 15 years ago, after armed groups started fighting against India.\n\nThe two countries have argued over who should rule Kashmir for years.
