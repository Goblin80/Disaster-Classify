[{'text': 'Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Israeli rescuers pulled a 22-year-old man from the ruins of a three-story building on Friday, 10 days after the massive earthquake killed tens of thousands of people.\n\nThe man, who was not immediately identified, was rescued near the quake-ravaged presidential residence south of the capital, according to the Israel Defense Forces.\n\nMaj. Zohar Moshe said American and French doctors asked for the Israeli team\'s assistance after trying to rescue the trapped man themselves.\n\nThe rescuers "were able to release him whole and healthy" and take him to an IDF field hospital in stable condition for further treatment," he said.\n\nRescuers continue efforts to find survivors who have defied the odds, including a 7-year-old boy and 11-year-old girl who were found Tuesday. Another 5-year-old boy, Monley, was pulled alive from rubble nearly eight days after the 7.0-magnitude quake had leveled much of Port-au-Prince.\n\nMore than 121 people have been pulled alive from the rubble, the United Nations said this week.\n\nFires are expected to flare up in the quake\'s aftermath, from broken mains and other damage. A massive blaze consumed a textile factory in Port-au-Prince Friday night as U.N. workers tried to contain the flames and spare nearby buildings. The cause of the fire was not immediately known.\n\nMeanwhile, aftershocks from the 7.0-magnitude quake have become a way of life for people here as they spend their days searching for food, water and shelter.\n\nHaitians brace for each aftershock as they wait for supplies and sustenance to reach them.\n\nMore than $355 million in donations in the United States alone has been raised for the relief effort, but stacks of aid -- baby formula, pain medication, antibiotics and other much-needed supplies -- are sitting on the tarmac and in warehouses at the airport in Port-au-Prince, the capital.\n\nWhat is reaching the hands of survivors is getting there at a snail\'s pace.\n\n"It\'s a shame, because you would hope that everything could get out there within seconds," Air Force Col. Ben McMullen told CNN\'s chief medical correspondent, Sanjay Gupta, at the airport. "But that kind of infrastructure just isn\'t in place."\n\nFull coverage | Twitter updates\n\nEach new aftershock -- smaller earthquakes that follow a more powerful one -- slows down the relief effort even further.\n\nFriday morning\'s 4.4-magnitude quake was much less powerful than the 7.0-magnitude one that struck January 12, leaving widespread death and destruction in its wake. A 5.9-magnitude earthquake Wednesday was the strongest aftershock of the week -- enough to cause considerable damage, the U.S. Geological Survey said, though the extent of damage that any earthquake causes depends on factors such as its depth, its proximity to dense population centers and the strength of structures where it hits.\n\nAn American adoption service provider in Haiti wrote in a blog that the aftershock Wednesday sent "a wall tumbling down on our heads." Save the Children said its staff "heard already-weakened structures collapsing" as a result.\n\nStill, the 7.0-magnitude quake was more than 40 times stronger than the 5.9-magnitude aftershock, researchers said. The death toll is estimated at 200,000, according to the European Union, whose commissioner for development and humanitarian aid, Karel De Gucht, got a firsthand view of the situation in Port-au-Prince this week.\n\nAbout 250,000 people are in urgent need of aid and another 3 million have been affected, the EU reported.\n\nDespite all the obstacles, some progress was made Friday.\n\nThe city\'s south pier was operating, though slowly. Authorities pushed Friday to get operations moving faster at the port. The north pier remained unusable, and the south pier is the smaller of the two.\n\nIn addition to the aftershocks, bottlenecks at all points of entry -- the airport, roads and ports -- have delayed food and medical aid to the estimated 3 million Haitians affected by the quake.\n\nCanadian troops have been working to open an airport in Jacmel, a seaside town about 8 miles from Port-au-Prince.\n\nAbout 120 to 140 flights a day were coming into the single-runway Port-au-Prince airport, compared with 25 a day just after the quake struck last week. But there was still a long list of flights waiting to come in, Lt. Gen. Douglas Fraser of the U.S. Southern Command said Thursday.\n\niReport: List of missing, found | Are you there?\n\nTo improve air traffic, the U.S. military said Wednesday it had obtained landing rights at the Dominican Republic\'s air base at San Isidro, about 220 kilometers (135 miles) east of Port-au-Prince.\n\nDominican troops will start patrolling a critical corridor between Jimani and Port-au-Prince, the United Nations said. The patrol should speed the delivery aid into Haiti, it said.\n\nIn the meantime, working under adverse conditions with limited supplies, medical teams have been forced to improvise.\n\nRenzo Fricke, field coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, said this week staffers had to buy a saw in the market so surgeons could do amputations. A CNN crew loaned a medic a pocketknife for another operation.\n\nLacking rubbing alcohol, doctors have used vodka to sterilize equipment and instruments. Surgical patients are receiving over-the-counter pain medicine because doctors lack stronger medication. One nurse used a string of Christmas lights as a makeshift extension cord.\n\nThe USNS Comfort, a U.S. naval hospital off the coast, received about 240 patients over 36 hours, said Capt. James Ware, the commanding officer. "Most of those individuals are critical care types of injuries," he told CNN\'s "American Morning."\n\nVirtually all are being brought to the ship by air. The ship has 80 doctors, including 24 surgeons, and 140 nurses, he said.\n\n"I think when we\'re totally mature, which will be in the next two to three days, we believe that we\'ll be able to push about 150 patients through to the ship and off the ship every day for surgical care, and the government of Haiti is giving us guidance exactly on where those patients will receive their follow-on care," he said, adding that officials hope the international community and the United Nations will oversee that process.\n\nMore than 300 aid distribution sites are up and running, a senior U.S. administration official said. More than 700,000 meals and 1.4 million bottles of water have been delivered, along with 22,000 pounds of medical supplies, Fraser said.\n\nImpact Your World\n\nPuerto Rico\'s 250-feet long, 80-feet wide Barge of Hope -- loaded five pallets high with food and water, medical supplies, generators and sundries -- set sail Friday afternoon.\n\nPuerto Rican authorities say that when it arrives in Haiti on Monday morning, it will be the single largest shipment of aid to arrive there to date. The roughly 4 million pounds of food are enough to feed the people of Port-au-Prince for a week. Organizers say it would take 150 planes to carry as much cargo.\n\nA group of rescuers told CNN Friday that each rescue gives them hope to keep working.\n\n"Every time we find a live victim that\'s the energy that keeps us going to the next day," said Capt. Louis Fernandez of Miami-Dade Urban Search and Rescue.\n\n"These are some of the harshest conditions I\'ve ever seen," he said, adding, "Nothing has ever prepared us for what we\'ve seen here this week."\n\nAt least 9,288 Americans and some of their family members in Haiti have been evacuated, according to the U.S. State Department, though the whereabouts of nearly 5,000 other Americans remain unknown. Some 75 others from the United States -- including five government officials -- are either confirmed or presumed dead.\n\n\n\nCNN\'s Arthur Brice, Susan Candiotti, Jill Dougherty, Eric Marrapodi, Lisa Desjardins and Elise Labott contributed to this report.', 'title': '10 days after quake, Israeli workers rescue buried survivor', 'url': 'http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/01/22/haiti.earthquake/index.html', 'keywords': ['buried', 'medical', 'airport', 'aid', 'doctors', 'quake', 'rescue', 'days', 'united', 'israeli', 'haiti', 'million', 'supplies', 'survivor', 'workers', 'portauprince'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Israeli rescuers pulled a 22-year-old man from the ruins of a three-story building on Friday, 10 days after the massive earthquake killed tens of thousands of people.\nAnother 5-year-old boy, Monley, was pulled alive from rubble nearly eight days after the 7.0-magnitude quake had leveled much of Port-au-Prince.\nAbout 120 to 140 flights a day were coming into the single-runway Port-au-Prince airport, compared with 25 a day just after the quake struck last week.\nIn the meantime, working under adverse conditions with limited supplies, medical teams have been forced to improvise.\nMore than 700,000 meals and 1.4 million bottles of water have been delivered, along with 22,000 pounds of medical supplies, Fraser said.', 'date': None}, {'text': "Still, some of the most immediate economic problems may be starting to ease. Gasoline is more readily available than in the first days after the earthquake, helping to relieve a thriving black market in which some street dealers were selling the fuel for as much as $8 a gallon. Remittances from Haitians living abroad have begun flowing here again after Western Union reopened some of its branches in the capital.\n\nPhoto\n\nForeign and government officials here are seeking to address a number of other problems, starting with the lack of money in the economy. Eric Overvest, the Haiti director for the United Nations Development Program, said that a new program would pay Haitians $3 a day to work for two-week periods to infuse cash into the economy. Almost 400 people began the work this week, and with about $4 million to disburse the program is expected to grow into the thousands.\n\nThe work involves clearing roads, ridding public areas of rubble and collecting corpses, some of which were being burned Thursday.\n\n“The economy is totally stalled,” Mr. Overvest said. “Giving a cash infusion means shops will open. The $3 will go to the shopkeepers, who will buy more supplies and the money will be passed along. It will have a tremendous catalytic effect on the entire economy.”\n\nHaiti’s economy was on rough footing before the quake, with more than 70 percent of the population surviving on $2 or less a day. But it was also showing signs of improvement, growing 2.9 percent in 2009, one of the hemisphere’s highest rates. Higher public spending, debt forgiveness by rich nations and an expanding textile industry, which provides more than 90 percent of export revenues, contributed to the growth.\n\nThe earthquake effectively shut down most textile companies, many of which are in the capital to be close to the port. In what may have been the earthquake’s largest loss of life in a single location, at least 500 people were killed at a Palm Apparel T-shirt factory near the airport, hitting the business empire of Alain Villard, one of Haiti’s largest manufacturers.\n\nThe quake also put into motion distortions like price gouging and an unexpected strengthening of the currency, the gourde, by more than 25 percent to a rate of about 30 to the dollar for some transactions. Fritz Jean, a former governor of the central bank, said the surge in the gourde’s value could be explained in part by the sharp drop in oil imports since the earthquake, keeping more dollars in Haiti’s economy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHaiti’s huge informal sector reacted faster to the quake than did established companies and banks. Outdoor markets like La Saline are already filled with goods from the countryside, including salt, cornmeal, fruits like mangoes and used clothing from the United States.\n\nPhoto\n\nEconomists here said that skyrocketing prices for some items, notably ice, which has doubled in price in some parts of the city, are related to the continuing lack of electrical service and efforts to extract quick profits amid uncertainty over what lies ahead.\n\n“People want candles because they have no electricity or fuel for their generators,” said Manouchka Wendiwou, 21, a vendor in La Saline who raised her candle prices by 60 percent and made no apology for charging what the market would bear.\n\nCharles Castel, the governor of the central bank, said in a telephone interview that such distortions should ease as services returned and the banking system started functioning again. Banks were expected to open their doors again in the interior on Thursday and in the capital by Friday or Saturday, he said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

"They are going to be going to places where they will have at least some adequate facilities."\n\nHe said buses would start moving the displaced people within a week to 10 days, once the new camps are ready.\n\nBrazilian UN peacekeepers were already levelling land in the suburb of Croix des Bouquets for a new tent city, the Geneva-based intergovernmental International Organization for Migration said.\n\nThe hundreds of thousands whose homes were destroyed in the Jan. 12 quake had settled in more than 200 open spaces around the city, the lucky ones securing tents for their families, but most having to make do living under the tropical sun on blankets, on plastic sheets or under tarpaulins strung between tree limbs.\n\nThe announcement came as search-and-rescue teams packed their dogs and gear, with hopes almost gone of finding any more alive in the ruins. The focus shifted to keeping injured survivors alive, fending off epidemics and getting help to the hundreds of homeless still suffering.\n\n"We\'re so, so hungry," said Felicie Colin, 77, lying outside the ruins of her Port-au-Prince nursing home with dozens of other elderly residents who have hardly eaten since the earthquake hit on Jan. 12.\n\nA melee erupted at one charity\'s food distribution point as people broke into the storehouse, ran off with food and fought each other over the bags.\n\nAs aftershocks still shook the city, aid workers were streaming into Haiti with water, food, drugs, latrines, clothing, trucks, construction equipment, telephones and tons of other relief supplies. The international Red Cross called it the greatest deployment of emergency responders in its 91-year history.\n\nBut the built-in bottlenecks of this desperately poor, underdeveloped nation and the sheer scale of the catastrophe still left many of the hundreds of thousands of victims without help. The US military reported a waiting list of 1,400 international relief flights seeking to land on Port-au-Prince\'s single runway, where 120 to 140 flights were arriving daily.\n\n"They don\'t see any food and water coming to them, and they are frustrated," said Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive.\n\nThe picture was especially grim at emergency medical centers, where shortages of surgeons, nurses, their tools and supplies have backed up critical cases.\n\n"A large number of those coming here are having to have amputations, since their wounds are so infected," said Brynjulf Ystgaard, a Norwegian surgeon at a Red Cross field hospital.\n\nOn Thursday, 18 hospitals and emergency field hospitals were working in Port-au-Prince. But the burden was overwhelming: Some quake victims have waited for a week for treatment, and patients were dying of sepsis from untreated wounds, according to Dr. Greg Elder, deputy operations manager for Doctors Without Borders.\n\nThe Pan American Health Organization said hospitals need more orthopedic surgeons and nurses, more supplies, and better sanitation and water.\n\nThe Haitian government asked that mobile clinics be set up in all of the more than 280 sites where Port-au-Prince\'s now-homeless have resettled in tents or in the open air on blankets and plastic sheets.\n\nDoctors warned, too, of potential outbreaks of diarrhea, respiratory-tract infections and other communicable diseases among hundreds of thousands living in overcrowded camps with poor sanitation.

Paul Doherty was supposed to be in Haiti Jan. 12, at a conference in the Hotel Montana in Port-au-Prince when a devastating earthquake leveled the city, killing thousands, including two men he was scheduled to meet.But other duties kept Doherty home on that fateful day.\n\nSome might say his absence — rare for someone who chairs the Michigan Area Haiti Task Force for the West Michigan and Detroit United Methodist Conferences — was divine intervention.\n\nOr, at the very least, providential.\n\n“Sometimes there are coincidences,” he says. “Other times, God-incidences. I’m not going to get all mystical about it. I’ll let God figure that out.”\n\nInstead the 70-year-old Doherty, who also pastors the Twin Lake United Methodist Church, will do what he’s done for the past 25 years.\n\nHe’ll roll up his sleeves and work on behalf of Haiti’s hungry and homeless — even as he also mourns the deaths of two fellow Methodist pastors he was supposed to meet Jan. 12 at a conference devoted to improving health care in Haiti.\n\nThe Rev. Samuel Dixon Jr. died in the rubble of the Hotel Montana before a search-and-rescue team could reach him. The Rev. Clint Rabb was rescued after being buried for 55 hours, but later died of injuries he’d sustained. Both men were from New York, members of the United Methodist General Board of Global Ministries.\n\n“It’s a great loss, a great loss,” Doherty says.\n\nBut he is compelled to turn his attention — and energy — toward Haiti, where the conferences help support 107 Methodist schools and provide hot lunches — usually beans and rice — for 17,000 school children every school day.\n\nRELATED CONTENT • Help for Haiti comes from many different sources\n\nMost of the financial support for the lunches comes from the West Michigan conference.\n\n“We have people who see the need, who see the Haitians are our brothers and sisters,” he says.\n\nLike so many places in Port-au-Prince, the Methodist schools, hospitals, churches and other buildings were destroyed — or damaged beyond repair— in the earthquake. Other schools in rural Haiti and outlying areas escaped the physical wrath of the earthquake, but that does not mean they are not affected.\n\n“We’re trying to figure out how to get food to them ... how to get them supplies that are running low,” he says.\n\nRoads are closed and impassable, and supplies are running low in Haiti, which is the Western Hemisphere’s poorest country. The average wage is $2 a day.\n\n“The Haitians are hard-working people, very spiritual, very dignified,” Doherty says.\n\nDoherty’s relationship with Haiti begins 25 years ago when he was the pastor at Constantine United Methodist Church in southern Michigan. Someone asked him to join a mission trip to Haiti, a country about which he knew very little at the time.\n\n“I’m ashamed to say it, but it was cold and icy here, and I thought: Hey, it’s got to be warm there,” he says.\n\nDoherty buries his head in his hands as he speaks, collecting his thoughts, gathering images of so many trips since that first time he saw the abject poverty in Haiti.\n\n“It was the worst experience of my life,” he says. “The poverty, it was overwhelming, but what hurt me the most was the children. ... Once you’ve seen Haiti’s children, you never forget.”\n\nDoherty returned home, a changed man, a man with a new mission. Although he is officially retired, at Twin Lake by special appointment for the past five years, he visits Haiti at least three times a year on mission trips, more if he goes to conferences like the one he was supposed to attend.\n\n“I don’t very often say no,” he says quietly, “but I just couldn’t go this time.”\n\nBesides chairing the state task force, Doherty is a consultant for the United Methodist Committee on Relief (UMCOR), works with the Global Ministries group and chairs the Haiti School Water Project.\n\n“Here’s the thing,” he says. “You can feed the children good, hot, nutritious meals, but if they don’t have clean water, if they’re dehydrated ... what kills the children in Haiti are the waterborne diseases. We have to get them water.”\n\n'Sacred worth'\n\nIn 2008, Doherty started up the Haiti School Water Project with the goal of providing clean drinking water to as many as 20,000 students in all 107 Methodist schools. He has already installed more than 600 heavy duty bio-sand water filters, plus sanitary storage dispensers.\n\n“Paul is persistent in bringing the plight of the Haitians in front of us. He raises their voices,” says the Rev. Susan Hagans of Muskegon, a retired pastor and district superintendent of the West Michigan United Methodist Church.\n\n“To him, every person has sacred worth.”\n\nIn 2002, Hagans and her husband, the Rev.

Rescuers heard some faint knocking early this morning, but the knocking stopped after the morning\'s aftershock, rescuers on the scene said. The hotel was popular with tourists and visiting officials. Americans are believed to be among the trapped.\n\n6:49 p.m. -- People trapped because of the January 12 earthquake still could be alive if they were well hydrated when the quake happened, said Dr. Michael Gerardi, a pediatric emergency specialist in Morristown, New Jersey. "It\'s conceivable, and not unheard of, for people to live seven to 10 days with no water or food -- if they have not been exposed to the elements," he told CNN\'s Tom Watson.

Canadian troops are working to open an airfield in the southern city of Jacmel by Thursday, Canadian Defense Minster Peter Mackay said. Two warships also are landing supplies by sea, and Canada has reached an agreement with Jamaica to fly supplies into southern Haiti from there. The moves come amid complaints from relief agency Doctors Without Borders that air traffic congestion in Port-au-Prince was delaying aid and costing lives.\n\n4:45 p.m. -- The U.S. military, trying to open other aid routes into Haiti, says it has obtained landing rights at the Dominican Republic\'s air base at San Isidro, about 150 miles east of Haiti\'s capital, Port-au-Prince.

They mark a vast cultural, social and economic divide. On the Dominican side, people speak Spanish, play baseball and drive on Tarmac; on Haiti\'s they speak French and Creole and play football; roads are largely dust and gravel. The Dominican is lush and covered in vegetation. In Haiti, by contrast, barely a tree stands. The country\'s once-lush forests have been razed for charcoal. Not only are we driving into a new landscape, but we also appear to be entering a more threatening world: the border guards warn new arrivals in the ruined country to beware of armed bandits.\n\nFriday 15 January, morning\n\nJust over an hour beyond the border Port-au-Prince begins. Barren countryside, where no building is taller than a shack and virtually no industry exists beyond subsistence farms, gives way to concrete one-storey buildings. The city was built on a flat estuary, framed by the Caribbean to its west and hills to its north and south. As the population rose from 400,000 to between two or three million, it sprawled inland.\n\nSuddenly, roads are chaos. Buses, cars, motorbikes and multicoloured "tap-taps" compete with people and animals, filling a strip of pot-holed concrete. Horns blare and traffic crawls. It makes you understand the difficulties of operating in a country that has virtually no infrastructure.\n\nThe devastation creeps up. For a while, just a handful of buildings seem damaged. Soon, a pile of rubble replaces every 10th building; then every fifth, then every third. By the time we reach the shell-shocked city centre, whole blocks have turned to piles of concrete and dust hangs in the air.\n\nBodies start appearing on pavements. Some are covered with sheets; others lie exposed. Up an alley, I see dozens of corpses, laid out in neat rows. The scale is frightening. Injured people are everywhere, being carried on makeshift stretchers, their shattered limbs in cardboard splints. Police, soldiers and other forces of law and order are nowhere to be seen. The only place in the entire city where I see any UN troops today is at the collapsed Montana Hotel, where teams of rescue workers are trawling through the rubble. Is it just coincidence, I wonder, that this luxury hotel is one of the few places where foreign people may be trapped, along with Haitians, under the rubble?\n\nFriday 15 January, afternoon\n\nGiven the TV coverage, and the failure of the security-obsessed international community so far to distribute any aid, in case victims start a riot, you could be forgiven for thinking of Haiti as a lawless hell-hole brimming with machete-wielding savages. The truth, of course, is the exact opposite. In crowded squares, where half a million are living under tarpaulins, people are friendly and hospitable. They tell awful stories, of homes destroyed and relatives killed, and constantly ask the same question: "When is help coming?"\n\nSaturday 16 January, morning\n\nThree guards, with machine guns, stand at the gate of Haiti\'s national cemetery. They are the first security forces I have seen on the streets since arriving in Port-au-Prince; they tell me they have been paid to stand there by the local mayor\'s office. The reason, it soon emerges, is grim practicality. Since the quake four days ago, bodies have been illegally dumped in the four-acre site. The entrances to family tombs have been kicked in and coffins shoved inside, without the $5 burial fee being paid. At the gate, a man sits with a crumpled wad of paper on which names of all the legal new arrivals have been scrawled. He counts 210. New ones arrive every five minutes, carried in makeshift coffins, or slung on the backs of lorries.\n\nI\'ll never forget the scene inside. Dozens of corpses are rotting in the sunshine, in awful piles. Chickens and stray dogs run among them. Blood and faeces litter the paths. The sheer hellishness of this snowballing human crisis starts to sink in. From the Carrefour district of Port-au-Prince we hear reports of piles of bodies being picked up in lorries and driven to mass graves on the outskirts of town. There is precious little dignity left for the living in Haiti, a colleague observes, and certainly none to spare for the dead.\n\nSaturday 16 January, afternoon\n\nWe come across a team of British rescue workers extracting trapped victims from the rubble. They have just saved a middle-aged woman, cutting through concrete with pickaxes and hammers, because their heavy-lifting equipment is stranded overseas. The team began working yesterday. They could have got here 24 hours earlier, but their plane was blocked from landing on the crowded runway of Port-au-Prince airport, where air-traffic control is being managed by the Americans. Today, a French aid flight containing an entire inflatable hospital was also turned back.\n\nThese lost hours cost lives. There is just a small window in which to find survivors after an earthquake, and in a couple of days\' time, the team says it will almost certainly be forced to call it quits, "though we\'ll keep going as long as we can". Their working hours aren\'t just limited by transport. Normally, after a major disaster, the team works 24 hours a day, catching sleep in shifts. But here, thanks to the supposed security threat, they are being transported back to base at dusk. "We have to do what we\'re told," one tells me, "but it\'s perfectly safe here. I feel more threatened in Romford on a Saturday night."\n\nSunday 17 January, morning\n\nFive days from the quake, and I have yet to see a single US soldier on the streets, though thousands are supposed to have landed in the capital. A few UN troops have begun sporadic patrols, and a handful of water trucks appear in the city\'s squares. They are met with orderly queues, rather than the chaotic mob violence we were told to expect.\n\nThe public is growing frustrated, though. With no food or water, victims are resorting to looting, leading to localised outbreaks of violence in the town centre. Their biggest fear is armed robbery. The city\'s prison has collapsed, and thousands of criminals are roaming the streets. In Pétionville, a corpse is smouldering on the pavement. Passers-by tell me it belonged to a thief who was arrested for shooting the owner of a juice stall in the head. Police turned him over to an angry crowd, who beat him up, stuck a car tyre over his head, filled it with petrol and dropped a match. You can see rings of metal wire, from the inside of the tyre, still hanging around the dead robber\'s neck.\n\nMonday 18 January\n\nWhere\'s the aid? There\'s an influx of fresh food from the countryside to street markets, but it\'s available only to people who have money. Long-promised free handouts are still apparently unable to get from the airport to the city centre. On the way to the airport, to find out what\'s going on, I finally see my first US soldier. He is guarding the American embassy, where a huge crowd has gathered, holding scrawled CVs and ID cards, seeking work as drivers or interpreters.\n\nHaiti\'s airport is a study in dysfunctionality. I am there for an hour, and see just a couple of flights land. Huge piles of food and water are sitting on the runway, cooking in the sun. No one knows who is in charge. US troops say the UN has responsibility. UN spokesmen pass the buck to Haiti\'s government, which is holding cabinet meetings on plastic chairs in a shack near by. With no flights able to land at night on the unlit runway, landing planes remains a source of enormous tension. At the weekend, according to new reports, French and US officials traded fisticuffs in the makeshift control tower. In the wake of this row, American soldiers are talking PR. They say they\'ve been ordered to wear weapons on their backs, so as not to appear threatening, and remove their ubiquitous wrap-around sunglasses and smile sweetly when dealing with locals.\n\nTuesday 19 January\n\nNormality is relative when you are still walking past dead bodies on the pavement every couple of hours, but things are perhaps improving. I see food, water and tarpaulins being handed out, and Black Hawk helicopters in the skies.\n\nPeople unable to get to aid distribution posts are still in trouble, though. And the news agenda is shifting to Haiti\'s orphans. There were 380,000 of them, even before the earthquake. Now the figure may be as much as a million. A lucky few are being shipped away to adoptive parents in the US and Europe.\n\nAt the Foyer de Sion orphanage in Pétionville, I encounter squalor. Twenty-eight girls and boys are down to their last few bags of beans and rice. They are thirsty, but have no drinking water. Bedrooms resemble a prison, with eight or more per room sleeping on filthy bunks. Excrement lines the floors. I do not see a single toy. The manager says a van arrived at the orphanage that morning, from a Mormon church in Salt Lake City, and whisked 10 of them away to new lives in the US. But something about the Foyer de Sion doesn\'t smell quite right: there is no way, even before the quake, it was ever the comfortable place pictured on its website, which is perused by would-be adoptive parents.\n\nAdoption can be a lucrative business, and the Foyer de Sion requires would-be parents to pay fees of almost $20,000 to rescue a child. It isn\'t entirely clear where this money goes. In the months and years to come, someone must take a long, hard look at Haiti\'s orphanage industry.\n\nWednesday 20 January\n\nCité Soleil is Port-au-Prince\'s most notorious slum, famously poor and full of street gangs. And while food and water are now starting to reach the rest of the city, residents here complain that the government and aid agencies are ignoring their plight.\n\nThe problem, again, is preconceptions about security: at the weekend, several gang leaders who had escaped from prison fought gun battles for control of their former stamping ground. But locals have fought back. They say they held a committee meeting and decided to prevent gangsters from returning. Several were lynched, including a notorious gang leader called Blade. This, it seems, is what now passes for justice.\n\nThursday 21 January\n\nOn the road out of Port-au-Prince, I see thousands of refugees crammed into lorries, cars and buses that have been laid on by the government. A massive exodus is under way by people who have reluctantly decided to return to their family homes in the countryside.\n\nIn the long run, Haiti could perhaps benefit from this demographic shift. Too much of the country\'s industry is centred around its capital, which – though small, crowded and chaotic – is the only place Haitians can hope to find gainful employment.\n\nLeaving the country, you pass fields where, as little as a decade ago, before a US trade embargo, coffee plantations made Haiti the world\'s third biggest coffee producer. You see the ruins of the sugar plantations that made it the richest island in the Antilles. They could rise again, particularly if the country\'s $1bn debt is dropped, and erase the memory of an era of greed, incompetence and mishandled natural disaster.\n\nMiracles in Haiti as survivors found one week on\n\nEmmanuel Buso, 21, was pulled from the rubble of his bedroom 10 days after the initial quake.

The UN says the scale of the disaster is "historic", with its staff confronting devastation and logistical problems on a scale never seen before. Here is a look at some of the issues agencies say have hampered the aid effort and how they are being dealt with. SCALE OF DISASTER The devastation has been described as \'historic\' in scale Aid agencies say Haiti is quite simply one of the worst disasters they have ever handled. "In every direction the task is huge, it is an historic challenge" UN spokesman Elisabeth Byrs told the BBC. "We are trying to run an operation for three million people, the task is huge and the coordination is immense." They say that while images of the misery in Haiti can spread rapidly around the world, aid supplies and skilled people cannot travel so fast. "Haiti is definitely the most complex emergency to date," said Jean Philippe Chauzy of the International Organization for Migration (IOM). He said it was difficult for those not involved in emergency aid to understand how difficult the operations can be. "The fact that the reporting is immediate might give the impression that aid can be sorted out in such a fashion, but you can\'t do that because of the scale of the operation and complexity." AIRPORTS AND PORTS Aid groups say supplies have been stuck at the airport While the main airport in Port-au-Prince was not put out of action by the quake, it is not equipped to deal with the volume of flights arriving. There have been complaints of huge backlogs, with some aircraft circling for hours or being diverted to the Dominican Republic. Paul Peachy of Christian Aid said it had difficult even getting emergency staff to Haiti. The UN says 150 planes are now landing daily in Port-au-Prince but the US Army, which has taken over control of the airport, says 1,500 planes are still scheduled to arrive. To speed up the process, aid flights are also coming into and out of the neighbouring Dominican Republic and in smaller airports in Haiti. Port-au-Prince\'s main port was also badly damaged by the quake and other ports in the area could only accept smaller vessels. One of the two piers in the capital\'s docks reopened on Thursday, allowing bulkier shipments to be delivered by sea. But on Thursday, Haiti\'s President Rene Preval joined several aid agencies in saying it is what happens when aid arrives in the country that is the problem. "People say to us: Where are the trucks to transport the aid? Where are the depots to store what arrives?" said Mr Preval. "What\'s important is coordination of the aid, so that we know what we receive, in what quantity, when and how it\'s distributed." DAMAGE TO ROADS Damaged roads make it harder to move resources around the country Moving aid to where it is needed has been hampered by damage to roads, piles of rubble in the streets or by the sheer volume of people trying to move out of or around the capital. "Road corridors are heavy with traffic, so travelling takes hours," said Ms Byrs of the UN. Aid agencies also report a lack of trucks and a lack of fuel but said supplies were now starting to arrive. They also hope to start employing local people soon in rubble clearing so reconstruction can begin. The fact that many roads were damaged also meant that survivors have tended to gather in small groups, rather than in larger camps, he said. "It is very difficult to reach out systematically when you\'ve got hundreds of groups of people in Port-au-Prince and the vicinity," he said. "If you manage to get tens of thousands of displaced people in one place you obviously streamline the distribution." The US has carried out air drops of basic supplies in some areas, but this is considered a last resort as it is considered inefficient and can lead to unrest on the ground as people compete for the few supplies. INFRASTRUCTURE Aid groups were unable to broadcast information to camps Phones and internet links were down in many areas of Haiti for some time after the quake, making it harder for agencies to coordinate their efforts. Mr Peachy of Christian Aid said it had been impossible to contact his colleagues in Haiti for the first 48 hours after the quake. But Mr Chauzy of the IOM said the lack of communications also meant it was hard to tell people needing aid where they could go to collect it. "Now the media is up and running, local radio station have started broadcasting and the UN\'s Radio Minustah has started broadcasting in Creole," he said. Many NGOs based in Haiti lost staff and equipment in the disaster, which meant the systems they had in place could not be used. Christian Aid was one of many to lose its entire building. Aside from the practical losses, many aid workers are also dealing with grief as they carry out their work. "For the moment we are concentrating - and I would say escaping - with the work. After, we will experience the emotions," said Ms Byrs at the UN.\n\nSAFETY ISSUES Armed police have been deployed to deter looting and violence There has been concern about the security situation in Haiti, with fears that people not receiving aid would turn to violence. John O\'Shea of Irish charity Goal told the Guardian newspaper he could not allow aid workers to move into Haiti from the Dominican Republican because he had "no guarantee that the people driving them are not going to be macheted to death on the way down". But while there have been reports of looting and some incidents of violence, other agencies say they have been impressed by how Haitians have responded to the disaster. Ms Byrs said the capital was "tense but calm" and that the few examples of violence were not representative of Haitian people. "We are seeing a huge solidarity between Haitian people. They resilient, they taken their fate into own hands from the very beginning," she said. Jean Philippe Chauzy of French agency Acted said the security issues in Haiti should neither be over-played nor used as an excuse to prevent aid deliveries. "The needs are there, people are desperate, if you don\'t distribute the assistance, people will be even more desperate and ready to resort to anything." On Thursday, a truck run by the US-based Catholic Relief Service was reported to have been overrun by desperate people when it arrived at a makeshift camp in the town of Leogane. But Adrien Tomarchio of Acted says the main safety concern has been for those people receiving aid. "The best process is not to start distribution at once and announce it so everyone comes," he says. "We make sure we can set up a proper secured distribution point, where people can come one-by-one. The aim is to deliver to the most vulnerable people first, then we also can focus on other groups."\n\nCO-OPERATION The US Army has been deployed in vast numbers in Haiti, both to help with the aid effort and to help maintain law and order. The US has tens of thousands of troops in the country Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has complained that the rush to get troops into the country has been at the expense of the delivery of humanitarian supplies. "Everything has been mixed together and the urgent and vital attention to the people have been delayed while military logistics - which is useful but not on day three, not on day four, but maybe on day eight - has really jammed the airport and led to this mismanagement." MSF say one of its planes carrying 12 tonnes of medical supplies was repeatedly turned away from the airport despite having prior permission to land. John O\'Shea of Goal said the failure of the UN and US to work together was leading to "a situation of utter chaos". The UN has dismissed such criticism, saying it "underestimated the logistical difficulties" and that the US was the only country in the region capable of providing logistical support on the scale needed. "We are not talking about politics, this is humanitarian. Our goal is to delivery assistance as soon as possible and co-ordination is vital - without it you can\'t get the right aid to the most vulnerable," said spokeswoman Ms Byrs. RESPONSIBLE AID Aid agencies are keen to stress that the response to a disaster such as Haiti must be responsible and durable. The last thing they want is for the mechanisms they put in place to lead to long term harm for the people they are trying to help. Badly managed distributions can mean the most needy go without Adrien Tomarchio, of French agency Acted, told the BBC the aim when distributing food is to get it to the right people quickly, rather than just get it out quickly. "If we distribute food all at once, some people will take more then they need and there is the risk of them selling food items, rather than it reaching the people that need it," he said. "The aim is to deliver to the most vulnerable people, then we can focus on other groups." In the case of shelter, there is little point in building a camp for displaced people without confirming they will be able to stay there, possibly for many months. Agencies have had to work with the local authorities to determine whether the land is suitable, whether it can be properly equipped with shelter and sanitation. Land rights issues also do not disappear after a disaster, so agencies have to establish who owns the land on which they hope to build. "You can\'t just go there and get land, level it and start building," says Jean Philippe Chauzy of IOM. Haiti\'s rainy season begins in May or June, so camps cannot be placed in areas which are likely to be flooded in the next few months. IOM, working with troops from Minustah, have started clearing a patch of land in a suburb about 10km out of Port-au-Prince, but say further camps will almost certainly be needed. As recovery begins, it is important that as many Haitians that can return to work do. A camp which is too far away from the capital for them to be able to travel in for work will benefit no one.\n\n\n\nBookmark with: Delicious\n\nDigg\n\nreddit\n\nFacebook\n\nStumbleUpon What are these?

Portions of it are bounded by subduction zones, where one crustal plate plunges beneath another. Some of these trigger the formation of volcanoes. It has a platelet, a kind of smaller plate within a plate, on which the island of Hispaniola – home to Haiti and the Dominican Republic – rides. And it exhibits the kind of long, side-slipping faults similar to California\'s San Andreas Fault.\n\n"The Caribbean is very complicated," says Jian Lin, a geophysicist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Woods Hole, Mass. "It\'s small to start with, but you have everything in plate tectonics in this very small region."\n\nThose processes have helped raise and sculpt a set of islands – from the Caymans to the Antilles – that are picturesque, geologically active, and occasionally dangerous as populations have grown.\n\nThe Jan. 12 temblor centered near the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince has vaulted it to the top of the list of most devastating quakes to hit the Caribbean. UN and other officials estimate that the death toll will reach well into the tens of thousands of people.\n\nThat eclipses the previous record-holder – a quake that hit the Leeward Islands in 1843. That struck as a magnitude 8.3 quake, killing 5,000 people, according to US Geological Survey data.\n\nIt took a volcanic eruption on Martinique in 1902 to approximate the devastation last week\'s quake inflicted on Haiti. That year Mt. Pelee erupted, hurling ash and superheated gas toward the town of St. Pierre. The eruption destroyed the town and killed some 30,000 people.\n\nThe Caribbean Plate was born deep beneath the ocean some 90 million to 100 million years ago, Dr. Lin explains, during a virtual tectonic tour of the Caribbean. It likely emerged via a "hot spot" in the Pacific at a time when the world\'s land masses were configured in a dramatically different way. Instead of leading to towering volcanic islands, the way a hot spot has formed the Hawaiian chain, the hot spot spawning the Caribbean Plate extended over a wide region, with magma oozing through fissures and vents and spreading horizontally to form a vast undersea plateau.\n\nFloating and diving plates\n\nIn plate tectonics, buoyancy counts for a lot. What is now the Caribbean Plate is more buoyant than typical ocean crust. And it\'s less buoyant than the crust that makes up continents.\n\nOver time, the North and South American continents migrated west, separated by a small ocean. As they moved, their ocean encountered the more-buoyant Caribbean Plate. It rode over the top of the oceanic crust separating the two continents.\n\nToday, the plate is bounded to the west by the Cocos Plate, which dives under the Caribbean plate just west of Central America. This movement built and sustains the region\'s volcanoes.\n\nAt the Caribbean Plate\'s southern boundary it slides under the South American Plate. To the east of the Leeward Islands as well as northeast of Hispaniola, the North American Plate is diving beneath the Caribbean.\n\nWhere the faults lie\n\nWhere plate meets plate head-on, as they do along the subduction zone east of the Leewards, volcanoes form, Lin continues. But where the collision along a subduction zone strikes at an angle, most of the collision energy goes into forming long fault zones, such as the Septentrional-Oriente Fault.\n\nThe Septentrional-Oriente Fault zone starts northeast of Puerto Rico, stretches west across the north coast of Hispaniola, slides past the southern end of Cuba, and reaches the Cayman Islands. Then, it takes a quick jog south along the Cayman Trough, the plate\'s spreading zone.\n\nAs for Hispaniola, it sits on a plate fragment known as the Gonave Platelet. The Septentrional-Oriente Fault forms its northern boundary. Its southern boundary is the now-infamous Enriquillo-Plantain Garden Fault, the source of Haiti\'s current seismic woes.\n\nThis fault and an associated undersea trench south of the Dominican Republic form the northern boundary of the Caribbean plate. The motion along the boundary carries the Caribbean Plate eastward along the zone -- the direction of last week\'s slip.\n\nIn 2008, a team led by University of Texas seismologist Paul Mann and Purdue University\'s Eric Calais calculated that if the accumulated strain along the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden Fault snapped in one event, the resulting earthquake would hit magnitude 7.2. But the projection lacked specifics in time and location. Dr. Mann points out that this section of the fault has never been studied in ways that would yield an average recurrence rate for major earthquakes.\n\nResearchers have raised similar red flags concerning the Septentrional-Oriente Fault.\n\nCarol Prentice, a US Geological Survey scientist who has studied the fault as it runs through the Dominican Republic\'s Cibao Valley, estimates that the fault is overdue for a major quake. Based on geological studies she and colleagues conducted, they estimate that if the accumulated strain were to be released in a single event, it could trigger a quake with a magnitude of at least 7.5.', 'title': 'Haiti earthquake: Why the Caribbean is a mini ring of fire', 'url': 'https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2010/0121/Haiti-earthquake-Why-the-Caribbean-is-a-mini-ring-of-fire', 'keywords': ['crust', 'boundary', 'fault', 'islands', 'ring', 'plate', 'west', 'earthquake', 'quake', 'zone', 'south', 'haiti', 'caribbean', 'mini'], 'tags': {'San Andreas Fault', 'Woods Hole', 'Caribbean Sea', 'Hispaniola', 'Central America', 'Cuba', 'Port-au-Prince', 'Caymans', 'Jian Lin', 'Cibao Valley', 'Paul Mann', 'California', 'Cocos', 'Haiti', 'Dominican Republic', 'Puerto Rico', 'Martinique', 'Purdue University', 'University of Texas', 'Leeward Islands', 'US Geological Survey', 'Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution', 'Eric Calais', 'UN'}, 'summary': "Known as the Caribbean Plate, this slowly migrating, slowly morphing patch of Earth's crust exhibits virtually every feature found on the world's largest plates.\nThe Caribbean Plate was born deep beneath the ocean some 90 million to 100 million years ago, Dr. Lin explains, during a virtual tectonic tour of the Caribbean.\nAs they moved, their ocean encountered the more-buoyant Caribbean Plate.\nToday, the plate is bounded to the west by the Cocos Plate, which dives under the Caribbean plate just west of Central America.\nThe motion along the boundary carries the Caribbean Plate eastward along the zone -- the direction of last week's slip.", 'date': 1264105860}, {'text': 'As rescuers wound down more than a week of searching for trapped survivors of last week\'s devastating quake, the government and its aid partners increasingly directed attention towards looking after the living – the hundreds of thousands of injured and homeless people needing medical assistance, food and shelter.\n\nThe seaport in the capital Port-au-Prince has been repaired enough to reopen for limited aid shipments, and a Dutch naval vessel unloaded pallets of water, juice and long-life milk.\n\nAid was flowing in to Haiti but was still not being distributed quickly enough to feed and shelter all those left hungry and destitute by the 7.0 magnitude quake that rocked Port-au-Prince on Jan. 12 and killed up to 200,000 people.\n\n"It\'s miserable here.

What is certain is that estimates will run into the hundreds of thousands. Hundreds of thousands more have been injured and many have lost limbs. Whole families are believed to have been wiped out in a matter of minutes. More children have now become orphans. Properties, large and small, are forever gone. The lives of the Haitian people will never be the same.\n\nThis earthquake has led to the most defining moment in the turbulent history of Haiti. I have visited Haiti, a country torn between violence and political turmoil, several times in the recent past and am very much aware of the flimsy buildings called homes all over the capital, Port-au-Prince, and elsewhere in the country. I can now very well imagine the devastation which has taken place there. On each visit to Haiti, I stayed at the Hotel Montana in the hills of Port-au-Prince. This once grand hotel, which afforded a beautiful, panoramic view of Port-au-Prince, now lies in ruins with an estimated 200 people, presumably dead by now, reportedly still under its rubble.\n\nPrior to the earthquake, it was hard to overstate the problems in the western hemisphere’s poorest country where more than 70 per cent live under the poverty line and around 50 per cent in abject poverty surviving on as little as US$1 per day. More than 50 per cent of the population is illiterate and an estimated 350,000 of Haiti’s children are orphans. The number of orphans may now rise in the aftermath of the earthquake. So bad is Haiti that there are 97 deaths for every 1,000 live births and life expectancy is just around 49 years. Haiti is a country heavily dependent on the estimated US$3B in annual remittances from the US, France and other countries where Haitians live.\n\nIn 2004, the United Nations commenced peacekeeping exercises in Haiti and this was largely responsible for some amount of political stability returning to an island nation which up to then was accustomed to political conflict since its independence from the French. The economy never really took off, but investors were reported to be investing in projects and 10,000 new jobs were created in the garment industry last year. Royal Caribbean Cruises also invested US$55M in the construction of a pier and tourist destination in Haiti, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBest Western hotel chain was also in the process of constructing a luxury hotel complex in the upscale Petionville suburb of Port-au-Prince. Many other investments, large and small, had been taking place in Haiti when the earthquake struck. These were all part of the economic recovery programme for this country which newly became a member of the regional economic grouping, Caricom.\n\nAs recently as 2008, Haiti descended into anarchy when four tropical storms devastated the island and sparked food riots which destabilized the government. As one protestor candidly put it then: “If the government cannot lower the cost of living it simply has to leave. If the police and UN troops want to shoot at us, that’s OK, because in the end, if we are not killed by bullets, we’ll die of hunger.”\n\nA significant portion of the economic, social and political predicament in Haiti can be traced to the decline of its agriculture sector. Up to about 30 years ago, Haiti was self sufficient in the production of rice, the varieties of which are believed to have been brought from Africa and are quite different from those varieties we plant in Guyana. The domestic production of this staple food of the Haitians started to decline in the mid-1980s mainly as a result of the adoption of trade liberalization policies imposed upon the country. In 1986, after the expulsion of Haitian dictator Jean Claude ‘Baby Doc’ Duvalier the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loaned Haiti US$24.6M in desperately needed funds (Baby Doc had raided the treasury on the way out). But, in order to get the IMF loan, Haiti was required to reduce tariff protections for their Haitian rice and other agricultural products and some industries to open up the country’s markets to competition from outside countries. The US has by far the largest voice in decisions of the IMF.\n\nBy 1988, so much American rice had invaded the country that it became unprofitable for many Haitian farmers to continue planting. The US rice farmers were enjoying subsidies totalling around US$1B per year while those in Haiti got nothing substantial from their often puppet-like and unstable governments.\n\nStill, in 1994, as a condition for US assistance in returning President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to continue his presidency, Haiti was forced by the US, IMF and the World Bank to open up its markets even more. Arguably, some believe Haiti’s agricultural decline can be tied to environmental degradation through the employ of unsustainable agricultural cultivation techniques that are designed to maximize crop yields with little regard for soil conservation. Soil erosion, they argue, decreased the productivity of the land.\n\nWhile this may be a sound argument, the shift in trade policies was even more detrimental to Haiti’s agriculture, especially its rice industry, and this brought the sector to its knees. The trade liberalization policies allowed for a lowering of the import tariff on rice imports which has since resulted in the dumping of subsidized US rice (known locally as ‘Miami rice’) in Haiti. Haiti is now, reportedly, the US third largest buyer of rice, importing almost 300,000 metric tons per year.\n\nThis import of Miami rice in a country which once fed itself, has only served to cause the collapse of the Haitian rice industry and the displacement and pauperizing of the tens of thousands of peasants who participated in the cultivation, processing and sale of Haitian rice.\n\nSome years ago I visited the Artibonite Valley, once a major rice hub in Haiti, with a delegation from the now dormant Caribbean Rice Association (CRA), and recall us meeting with a few hundred farmers who attended the meeting because they believed we were going to give them some form of aid. I vividly remember some of these farmers asking where are the shovels, forks and hoes that we brought.\n\nThese are farmers with ½ acre plots on which they depend for their subsistence and livelihood and the small implements are what they use for their farming. At the time of our visit, the Taiwanese were helping the Haitians to improve their productivity levels to ensure viability of the industry. This did not work out because of the continued import of the subsidized US rice, some of which was given away freely as aid. Today, most of these farmers have been forced from their little holdings and have gone is search of a life away from rural Haiti where all hope has been lost, all because Haiti remains the poorest and least trade restrictive country in the Caribbean and possibly the western hemisphere.\n\nMany have ended up in the slums of overcrowded Port-au-Prince and other cities and towns across the island. Many have attempted to flee the island. Many have died pursuing the elusive dream of a better life through illegal migration in rickety boats. Some were fortunate to make the often deadly trip and are now settled in ‘Little Haiti’ in Miami.\n\nIn 2000, it was widely reported in the international media that several dozen impoverished rice growers and their families, deciding they could bear life in Haiti no longer, pooled their meagre savings, bought a rickety boat and headed to the Turks and Caicos Islands. Halfway into the 150 miles trip, the vessel capsized killing all 60 on board. Had the US not displaced these families from the land, they may very well be alive and planting rice in Haiti today.\n\nMany of those who died in Port-au-Prince in the earthquake are rural folks forced from the lands because of the devastating consequences of trade liberalization imposed on Haiti. They went to Port-au-Prince, built shacks, tried to eke out a living, but died because of another devastation.\n\nBrazilian President Lula, on a visit to Haiti in April, 2008, said that “rich countries need to reduce farms subsidies and trade barriers to allow poor countries to generate income with food exports. Either the world solves the unfair trade system, or every time there’s unrest like in Haiti, we adopt emergency measures and send a little bit of food to temporarily ease hunger.”\n\nIn the meantime, had it not been for the unfair trade liberalization policies imposed on the Haitians collectively by the US, IMF and the World Bank, many Haitians would today have been alive, residing and farming in rural Haiti and enjoying relative happiness, instead of being buried alive in rubble in Port-au-Prince and other towns and cities across the island where they sought refuge from economic hardships.\n\nIt now seems as if a perpetual darkness has enveloped the western portion of this historic island of Hispaniola.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nMahadeo Panchu', 'title': 'Trade liberalization killed Haiti’s rice industry', 'url': 'https://www.stabroeknews.com/2010/opinion/letters/01/21/trade-liberalization-killed-haiti%E2%80%99s-rice-industry/', 'keywords': ['little', 'country', 'industry', 'haitian', 'earthquake', 'trade', 'killed', 'rice', 'haiti', 'haitis', 'portauprince', 'island', 'farmers', 'liberalization'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Dear Editor,The exact number of lives lost in the cataclysmic Haiti earthquake may never be known.\nBy 1988, so much American rice had invaded the country that it became unprofitable for many Haitian farmers to continue planting.\nThe trade liberalization policies allowed for a lowering of the import tariff on rice imports which has since resulted in the dumping of subsidized US rice (known locally as ‘Miami rice’) in Haiti.\nThis import of Miami rice in a country which once fed itself, has only served to cause the collapse of the Haitian rice industry and the displacement and pauperizing of the tens of thousands of peasants who participated in the cultivation, processing and sale of Haitian rice.\nSome were fortunate to make the often deadly trip and are now settled in ‘Little Haiti’ in Miami.', 'date': 1264050474}, {'text': 'The United States was leading an international relief effort Wednesday to rescue victims trapped in the rubble and provide aid after a devastating earthquake in Haiti, as dozens of other countries contributed assistance ranging from heaps of cash to small teams of aid workers.\n\nCanada, European nations and countries across Latin America have mobilized supplies and aid for the island nation.\n\nBut one geographically close country is conspicuously absent from the roster of helping hands.\n\nCuba, which had evacuated some of its residents as a precaution in case the earthquake triggered a tsunami, has so far not offered any assistance publicly to its devastated island neighbor.\n\nThough the two countries have had warm ties since establishing relations 12 years ago after a 36-year break, the Cuban government Web site, along with Cuban news agencies, did not detail any offers of Cuban aid.\n\nA representative from the Cuban diplomatic offices in the U.S. could not be reached for comment.\n\nDespite the missing neighbor, most major nations in the Western Hemisphere, along with many European nations, were scrambling to provide aid by Wednesday morning.\n\nPresident Obama on Wednesday promised "unwavering support" to Haiti following a powerful earthquake that he said was a "tragedy" that "seems cruel and incomprehensible."\n\n"The people of Haiti will have the full support of the United States in the urgent effort to rescue those trapped beneath the rubble and to deliver the humanitarian relief of food water and medicine that Haitians will need in the coming days," he said.\n\nObama announced a "swift, coordinated and aggressive effort to save lives" consisting of search-and-rescue operations and humanitarian relief of food, water and medicine.

Whether in the aftermath of civil wars or the wake of natural disasters, its employees and the military personnel seconded to the UN are frequently among the first to enter the hostile environments.\n\nDanger comes with that territory, and UN workers have lost their lives in a dozen countries around the world as a consequence. But the Haiti earthquake on Tuesday that devastated the capital Port-au-Prince and killed tens of thousands of Haitians, is shaping up to be the deadliest for the UN\'s own employees in the organization\'s 65-year history.\n\nThe earthquake quickly demolished much of the Christopher Hotel, the UN\'s Haiti headquarters, as it did to hundreds of buildings across the city. Speaking in New York on Thursday, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said that roughly 150 of his staff remained unaccounted for and estimated that about 100 of the missing were in the hotel at the time of its collapse. He said that 22 soldiers and policemen seconded to the UN have already been confirmed dead.\n\n"I have seen the image of this UN headquarters," Mr. Ban said. "It was terrible. Half of the Christopher Hotel had totally collapsed."\n\nUN staff are typically given training in emergency preparedness and rally points that they should head to in the event of catastrophes like the one that struck Haiti.\n\nAnd while Haiti has never seen a disaster like the current one, it\'s long been a dangerous and unstable place. The UN has had a continuous presence in Haiti since 1994, when 20,000 peace-keepers were deployed. In the 15 years since and before the earthquake, the UN had suffered 57 fatalities in Haiti, 37 of those to peace keepers. Before the earthquake, the UN had about 11,000 people in country, 9,000 of them international soldiers and police.\n\n\n\nBan has refused to confirm reports, one from the Haitian president, that the head of the UN mission to Haiti Hédi Annabi was among the dead. The UN says simply that he has not yet been found, and that they hope that he and the rest of the missing are alive in the rubble, waiting for rescue.\n\nEdmond Mulet, Mr. Annabi\'s predecessor, was named as an interim replacement by Ban on Thursday, and was expected to arrive in Port-au-Prince around mid-afternoon.\n\nBan described frantic efforts to find survivors in the Christopher Hotel\'s rubble, with rescue teams working with dogs on the pile to find signs of life. One success was the discovery of injured Estonian bodyguard Tarmo Joveer, who was found alive and dehydrated under about 12 feet of rubble. After being given water through a hose, the debris was eventually cleared and he was taken to hospital.\n\n"It was a small miracle during a night, which brought few other miracles,\'\' Ban said. "We will continue to work, to search and rescue, as quickly as possible. I think the first 72 hours will be critically important. Now we are approaching 48 hours by 5:00 this afternoon. I hope that we will have more and more survivors."\n\nThe three-day window Ban referred to is crucial in search and rescue. Beyond that point, with dehydration and the effect of injuries often worsening, survival is much less likely.\n\nThe current death toll of 22 matches the third deadliest day for the UN its history, the suicide truck bombing of the Canal Hotel in Baghdad in August, 2003. Among the 22 casualties of that attack was Sergio Vieira de Mello, the head of the UN mission in Iraq.\n\nThe single deadliest day for the UN was in 1961, when 44 peacekeeping soldiers from Ghana were killed in ambush by the Congolese National Army.\n\nFor other updates on Haiti, follow the Global News Blog.', 'title': 'Haiti earthquake: UN confronts largest tragedy in own history', 'url': 'https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2010/0114/Haiti-earthquake-UN-confronts-largest-tragedy-in-own-history', 'keywords': ['soldiers', 'confronts', 'largest', 'hotel', 'rubble', 'head', 'earthquake', 'rescue', 'deadliest', 'haiti', 'ban', 'christopher', 'history', 'tragedy'], 'tags': {'Edmond Mulet', 'Christopher Hotel', 'Canal Hotel', 'Port-au-Prince', 'New York', 'Haiti', 'Baghdad', 'UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon', 'Ghana', 'UN', 'Iraq'}, 'summary': 'But the Haiti earthquake on Tuesday that devastated the capital Port-au-Prince and killed tens of thousands of Haitians, is shaping up to be the deadliest for the UN\'s own employees in the organization\'s 65-year history.\nThe earthquake quickly demolished much of the Christopher Hotel, the UN\'s Haiti headquarters, as it did to hundreds of buildings across the city.\nHalf of the Christopher Hotel had totally collapsed."\nAnd while Haiti has never seen a disaster like the current one, it\'s long been a dangerous and unstable place.\nIn the 15 years since and before the earthquake, the UN had suffered 57 fatalities in Haiti, 37 of those to peace keepers.', 'date': 1263506940}, {'text': 'At 4:53 p.m., exactly six months ago today, Haiti was ravaged by a 7.0 earthquake that killed more than 230,000 people, left 1.5 million homeless, and created what aid groups have called the most complex humanitarian crisis of modern times.\n\nSix months on, there are efforts to hail. As the international aid organization Oxfam points out, for example, the massive scale of aid response has helped prevent what, in the early days, seemed like a probable worse-case scenario for Haiti: widespread riots for water or housing. Neither has there been, to date, a major outbreak of water-borne disease.\n\nBut for far too many Haitians, life has changed little since the moments after the temblor, with many still living in precarious make-shift camps, living day by day, with few prospects for work, and fearing a new disaster as the hurricane season gets underway.\n\nOPINION: Business solutions to Haiti\'s poverty\n\nIn the Champs de Mars camp that sprung up spontaneously in front of the National Palace right after the quake, life looks less “temporary” by the day. Very few people there seemed to notice that today marks six months since the earthquake, and that, across the street, President René Préval and former US President Bill Clinton were commemorating the solemn anniversary.\n\n“Nothing has changed in six months. There are still no jobs and no solid shelter,” says Gilbert Gregory, a father of three who was sitting under a white plastic tarp in Champs de Mars. “By now people are used to living in the camps but it’s because they have no choice, not because it’s a good situation. The government didn’t take any responsibility, all this aid came in, but nothing happened with it. It’s difficult to swallow.”\n\n4.3 million received food aid\n\nThe United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs released a report to mark six months of relief efforts, including a humanitarian response that provided emergency shelter for 1.5 million survivors.\n\nTo date, the UN notes, some 4.3 million people have received food and 1.1 million have received a daily supply of safe drinking water. (According to Oxfam water and sanitation experts, metropolitan Port-au-Prince today has more drinking water and toilets than before the earthquake.) Thousands have also received medical assistance, including 4,000 victims who needed amputations.\n\nThese are big feats considering that the government, already weak before January 12, was as devastated by the earthquake as the country it leads.\n\nSeventeen percent of the Haitian government workforce was killed, while all ministry buildings were destroyed except for one, write Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive and Mr. Clinton, co-chairs of the Interim Haiti Reconstruction Commission, in a New York Times op-ed. The crumbled National Palace has long been a symbol of the hard road ahead for Haiti.\n\nChallenges ahead\n\nBut enormous challenges remain, and housing sits at the top of the priority list.\n\nOnly a fraction of Haitians have been resettled into permanent housing, which is causing frustration to mount.\n\n“Six months on, we need to be looking at recovery, where people can settle into a secure home, have a job, send their kids to school, and have a community around them,” says Julie Schindall, the spokesperson for Oxfam who has been in Port-au-Prince since March. “When I go to camps, and I ask, \'How are you doing?\' People say \'We are OK, we have water, we have toilets, there is a clinic nearby,\' but they ask me, \'When will we get to leave this camp?\' ”\n\nWhile Ms. Schindall says comprehensive resettlement is not a realistic goal six months on, plans to implement strategies are – and so far there are few that indicate implementation on a meaningful scale.\n\nInefficiency, bureaucracy hamper efforts\n\nFor too many observers, the recovery effort has been slower than necessary, hampered by inefficiency and bureaucracy, and many Haitians say they feel abandoned by their government six months on. Oberson Saint Vik finds relief from the heat under a blue tarp on a recent day in Champs de Mars. Like many residents here, he used to live in Bel Aire, one of Port-au-Prince’s poorest neighborhoods. He had no idea that a ceremony was underway across the street.\n\n“The government never tells us anything,” he says. “It’s going to take ages before something changes. I don’t know how long.”\n\nChildren lined up for a food distribution, which many in the camp say they suspect was a media opportunity because of the government ceremony next door.\n\nFifteen-year-old Marie Anne Tanis was holding a plastic box with an apple, a piece of bread, and a yogurt.

But why was the human cost so much greater for Haiti?\n\nWhen Pete Garratt, Red Cross head of disaster relief, received an alert on 12 January indicating a large quake had hit Haiti near its capital Port-au-Prince, he instantly recognised the seriousness of the emergency. "I knew that meant deaths and injuries," he says. The reason he predicted the effects of the quake would be so grave, Mr Garratt explains, is that there are a number of critical factors, learned through years of experience, that contribute to the scale of devastation following such big shifts of the Earth\'s crust. One is, perhaps obviously, the size of the quake , but also how near it is to the surface, the density of the population near its epicentre, as well as whether there are any heavily urbanised areas nearby. These all indicate a higher death toll - and were all features of the Haiti quake.\n\nBut poverty also plays its role, Mr Garratt explains, as it exacerbates a country\'s or region\'s vulnerability to such disasters. In places such as Haiti, where 72.1% of the population live on less than $2 a day, and in cities like Port-au-Prince, where many are housed in poor and densely-packed shantytowns and badly-constructed buildings, the devastation is always expected to be greater. "These countries have less money to put into buildings and there is less governance ensuring building codes are followed," Mr Garratt explains. "Corruption can also be an issue and so, even when there are government structures to ensure building codes are followed, there are bribes that enable people to take short cuts. "Put simply - there are the technical elements of the earthquake and then the social elements on top of that." Therefore, the fact that the Haiti quake hit close to a poorly-constructed, large urban area was crucial in reducing people\'s chances of survival.\n\n"In Italy it was one town, and a few surrounding villages - not a large urban area. And in China, although it affected a large area and big towns, it was not a city," says Mr Garratt. "In Haiti, in a big city like Port-au-Prince, with so many structures coming down, this means more rubble will kill more people." The resulting scale of destruction - of infrastructure, of government and other official organisations - also made it much more difficult to respond once the earthquake hit and had an impact on the number of people rescued from the rubble.\n\nHaiti, unlike China and Italy, simply did not have the resources to act quickly, and it took time to get outside help in. "The Chinese government was able to mobilise a very military response. Although some parts were hard to reach initially," says Mr Garratt. "The resources they had were very impressive. "The problem in Haiti was the airport was only half-functioning and you had one road route that took a day to traverse." The dense urban environment in Port-au-Prince also made it a difficult place for rescue teams to work once they were there, he says. "You could say that the resulting congestion in large cities meant there was less room for manoeuvre. "But there were an enormous number of search and rescue teams there and considering the difficulties getting there, they did a good job." However, the statistics on rescues may not necessarily reflect the true number of victims freed in and around Port-au-Prince, he warns. "The majority of people are pulled out of the rubble by their neighbours." Lessons learned The Red Cross, which had teams dealing with the aftermath of the China, Italy and Haiti earthquakes, believes aid agencies learn lessons from every disaster, although each - like Haiti - poses fresh questions. "We are always getting better," says Mr Garratt. "But what is a challenge is that there is always something new." One of the problems in Port-au-Prince is the lack of space, he adds, as well as a constantly shifting and mobile population. The task now for such organisations is to help the people of Haiti get back on their feet, given the inevitable crippling economic cost of such a quake.\n\nAnd as the Red Cross and others admit, their success in responding to the Haiti emergency will be judged not just on the first weeks of emergency aid, but on whether communities are left more resilient and better equipped when the next disaster strikes.\n\n\n\nBookmark with: Delicious\n\nDigg\n\nreddit\n\nFacebook\n\nStumbleUpon What are these?

The collapse of the Montana was also a symbolic blow: In addition to being one of the city\'s prestige destinations, the hotel housed many members of the UN stabilization mission in Haiti.\n\nAccording to Haitian architect Philippe Leon, the Montana collapse was just one example of the lax building standards and poor code enforcement that made Haiti particularly vulnerable to seismic tremors. Like the city\'s largest supermarket, which also collapsed, the owners of the Montana had added extra stories to the building, placing extra load on the structure.\n\n"The Montana they added two stories, it crumbled down," he said. "The supermarket they added two stories, it crumbled down."\n\nTo make matters worse, Leon said, buildings like the Montana were often situated on a poor foundation: sandy, unstable soil that propagated the shock wave from the earthquake. "If you have a weak soil, the wave will go fast, and the wave will collapse it," he said. "If you have rockier soil … it will attenuate it."\n\nWhatever the flaws in its design may have been, the Montana was still a luxury hotel. In Haiti\'s desperately poor neighborhoods, residents live in shoddily constructed concrete and masonry structures that are often prone to collapse, even without a seismic event. During the quake, it created the gruesome cascade effect seen here, as houses slid down the hills and swept away the residences below.\n\nLeon is not the only one to point to Haiti\'s generally poor earthquake-preparedness. In a presentation last week in Port-au-Prince, Eric Calais, a professor of geophysics from Purdue University in Indiana, noted that the magnitude 7.0 quake was the deadliest recorded event of this scale. The 1989 Loma Prieta quake in the San Francisco Bay Area, by comparison, measured 6.9 and claimed 63 lives; the 1995 Kobe earthquake in Japan was a 6.8, and it caused 6,500 deaths. By the last official count, the Haiti quake has claimed around 230,000 lives, and more casualties are expected to follow from the outbreak of infectious disease.\n\nSo when it comes to rebuilding Haiti, Calais said, it\'s time to start think differently. "The real question," he said, "is how to adapt to seismic hazards."\n\nCalais is leading a seismology project in Haiti that is supposed to take a closer look at these issues. But Haitians are not waiting for the results of any study to start rebuilding: As I noted earlier, many Haitians are already taking matters into their own hands and starting to build improvised structures before the rainy season starts. And that carries the risk of more casualties as aftershocks continue to hit.\n\nAnd as Haiti returns to some sort of normalcy, it makes the issue of building design all the more urgent. Leon, who is working with his clients to appraise the structural soundness of his own buildings – and volunteering some of his time to assess slum dwellings to see if they are safe to inhabit – told me he hoped the quake would force a rethink of architecture in Haiti.\n\n"The earthquake maybe has shaken some attitudes," he said. "It might be good timing to start something new."\n\nBut the bigger issue, he said, was not enforcing building codes, but encouraging rule of law. The casual attitude to regulation and enforcement, he said, was persistent problem in Haitian society. "The mentality is so encrusted, I don’t know what will get people to react," he said. "Maybe it’s a good thing there are some aftershocks from time to time."\n\nPhoto: Nathan Hodge', 'title': 'Seismic Study: Earthquake-Proofing Haiti', 'url': 'https://www.wired.com/2010/02/earthquake-proofing-haiti/', 'keywords': ['collapse', 'hotel', 'wave', 'seismic', 'study', 'earthquakeproofing', 'montana', 'quake', 'earthquake', 'building', 'haiti', 'start', 'poor'], 'tags': {'#Reconstruction', '#Info War'}, 'summary': 'PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti – A careful excavation continues at the site of the Hotel Montana, the four-star hotel toppled by the January 12 earthquake.\nAccording to Haitian architect Philippe Leon, the Montana collapse was just one example of the lax building standards and poor code enforcement that made Haiti particularly vulnerable to seismic tremors.\n"If you have a weak soil, the wave will go fast, and the wave will collapse it," he said.\nBy the last official count, the Haiti quake has claimed around 230,000 lives, and more casualties are expected to follow from the outbreak of infectious disease.\nAnd as Haiti returns to some sort of normalcy, it makes the issue of building design all the more urgent.', 'date': None}, {'text': '\n\nThe human cost of the earthquake in Haiti has been huge; millions have been left hungry, their homes, schools and hospitals destroyed and their livelihoods taken away. The government estimates it will cost about $11.5bn (£7.6bn) to repair and reconstruct the country over the next three years. The earthquake - the most powerful to hit Haiti for 200 years - caused maximum impact as it hit the most densely populated area of the country. The government assessment said the damage was all the more severe because it came after a period of relative stability, when people had begun to see their living conditions improve. An emergency flash appeal launched by the international aid community within days of the Haiti earthquake quickly reached its $577m (£382m) target - but that target had to be revised upwards a month later when the full extent of the humanitarian operation became clear. The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) issued a new target of $1.5bn to be spent over the next 12 months. The key aim is to provide an "environment for safe and healthy living for all affected people until reconstruction restores normality."\n\nThe UN conference on 31 March is meeting to consider longer-term aid for Haiti. The country\'s government published a Preliminary Damage and Needs Assessment (PDNA) on 24 March. The document put the total cost of earthquake damage at $7.9bn - 120% of Haiti\'s GDP. It has estimated the cost of rebuilding the country will cost $11.5bn, spread across a variety of sectors, including governance, environment, social sectors, infrastructure and production. The Haitian government says public confidence needs to be regained in the way the country is governed and this will involve improving the system of public administration so wages get paid, encouraging the democratic process and modernising the justice system. Haiti has been identified as a very vulnerable country, at high risk of cyclone and other natural disasters, and the PDNA recommends money should be spent improving on disaster prevention. Social services were inadequate before the earthquake with many children not attending school and 38% of the population over the age of 15 were illiterate. Reconstruction money will be spent on providing free primary education for all, improving access to health services and reducing malnutrition. Money spent on infrastructure will include training in building techniques to reduce risks, restoring the road and telecommunications networks. Before the earthquake, unemployment was running at 30%. Trade, tourism, transport and communication were all badly affected by the quake and so efforts will concentrate on economic growth to create new jobs, as well as improving working conditions.\n\n\n\nBookmark with: Delicious\n\nDigg\n\nreddit\n\nFacebook\n\nStumbleUpon What are these?

But Zanmi Lasante (ZL), the Haitian branch of Partners in Health (PIH), was left intact. ZL had been the largest health care provider in rural Haiti. After the quake, it became (temporarily, at least) the largest and one of the most important in the entire country.\n\nPIH was founded in 1987 by Dr. Paul Farmer and a small group of colleagues. Together, they built a clinic in a rural, desperately impoverished squatter settlement of farmers who had lost their land to a hydroelectric dam. PIH now works in 12 countries on four continents, but in many ways Haiti remains its heart and soul. ZL has become a comprehensive public health system supported by international donors but staffed almost entirely by Haitians: about 4000 people in all, including some 120 doctors, 600 nurses, and 2000 trained and salaried community health workers. It has brought AIDS and tuberculosis under control in the province called the Central Plateau, vaccinated nearly everyone in its large catchment area, cleaned up water supplies, built houses for the poorest patients, renovated and supported schools, and launched programs to feed thousands of Haitians daily with locally produced food. All in all, ZL directly serves 1.2 million people, at no cost to the local population, and has built or renovated 12 hospitals and clinics, six with surgical facilities, all with well-stocked pharmacies, and made the Haitian Ministry of Health its partner in their ownership and operation.\n\nMembers of ZL's staff were some of the first health care workers to respond to the disaster. Some ZL doctors have homes in the capital and happened to be there at the time of the quake. One of them, Dr. Patrick Almazor, set up a clinic in his backyard and spent the night caring as he best he could for about 50 injured people. Dr. Louise Ivers of Harvard Medical School was also in Port-au-Prince, attending (ironically enough) a United Nations meeting about emergency preparedness. Once she had escaped from the crumbling building where the meeting took place, she and a number of volunteers set up an impromptu clinic in a driveway, using license plates for splints.\n\nWheelbarrows Serve as Stretchers and Cardboard for Splints at Chascot Clinic in Port-au-Prince. Photo courtesy of Dr. David Walton of Partners in Health.\n\nThe leaders of ZL know their way around Haiti, and they aren't obliged to wait for instructions from PIH headquarters in Boston. As soon as they heard of the devastation, several of the senior doctors at ZL's hospitals loaded up trucks with supplies and headed for the city, looking for groups of people in need. All around Port-au-Prince, people in ruined neighborhoods were organizing provisional, unsheltered settlements. Within a couple of days, members of ZL's staff had created four mobile clinics and were systematically searching out those encampments, bringing food and water, treating people with minor wounds, and transporting the severely injured to the various surgical facilities that were being set up around the city. That effort has since expanded and continues.\n\nFor a long time, the majority of Haitians have been denied the most basic of human rights: the right to clean water, decent shelter, and adequate nutrition. At their hospitals and clinics, ZL's staff deals every day with the results — with chronic disasters of disease, such as kwashiorkor and malaria, eclampsia and diarrheal diseases. On an average day, their largest hospital receives about 400 patients, and their community health workers carry medicines to more than 4700 homes. In the first 3 weeks after the earthquake, the 12 facilities had to continue this work while also caring for thousands of wounded people, some with compound fractures, some even with compartment syndrome, some already with gangrene, who made their way from the capital in the crowded taxis and trucks that are the nearest thing to public transportation in Haiti.\n\nSome veterans of medical catastrophes believe that the earthquake caused orthopedic injuries in a greater proportion of the population than any other disaster has done. ZL had 14 operating rooms at its own sites but no orthopedic surgeons on hand. PIH has many partners, though, and in the weeks after the earthquake, offers of personnel and supplies came from 153 organizations — from medical equipment corporations and sporting goods companies, American medical schools and teaching hospitals, and Haitian-American associations. PIH's Boston headquarters created a virtual small airline to manage the transport, which within 3 weeks after the earthquake included 70 flights carrying 150,000 pounds of supplies and medical equipment and 205 volunteers, most of whom were already organized into surgical teams. When the flights arrived in Haiti, ZL's operations director Loune Viaud managed their unloading and amid the chaos of the wounded city arranged for distribution of cargo and personnel to the large variety of sites where they were needed. For a time PIH was managing or helping to manage and supply 24 operating rooms that performed surgeries day and night. PIH also helped to coordinate the transport of patients to the U.S. Navy's hospital ship Comfort, which arrived 8 days after the quake. And Farmer, in his role as the United Nations' deputy special envoy to Haiti, helped to coordinate the relief effort at the national level — an all but impossible job, since thousands of organizations were clamoring to play a part.\n\nPatients in Port-au-Prince Receive Medical Care in a Tent Erected to Replace a Damaged Hospital Ward. Photo courtesy of Dr. David Walton of Partners in Health.\n\nViewed as a whole, the international medical response to Haiti's catastrophe has been praiseworthy, grand in scale, and successful in alleviating some of the suffering and in saving many lives. But it has been far from good enough. PIH clinicians tell me that the current estimates of 200,000 dead seem likely to be accurate, and they add that many thousands would not have died if they had received medical care in time. One reason for delay was the clustering of Haitian government offices and international organizations in the capital city, near the earthquake's epicenter. That is, Haiti lost a lot of the resources that could have been used to marshal a more effective response. But many of those resources weren't very good to begin with. Haiti's vulnerability to disasters stems fundamentally from poverty. This poverty is both material and institutional and is manifested not only in buildings made with unreinforced concrete but also in a Ministry of Health that in the aftermath of the earthquake lacked buildings, vehicles, Internet access, computers, and even pens and paper.\n\nThe long history of poverty in Haiti reflects badly on Western governments in general and that of the United States in particular. It reflects badly on private aid organizations as well. At least 10,000 nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) were operating in Haiti at the time of the earthquake. That number alone represents a sad indictment, given that a great many of those groups had been working in Haiti for years, during which Haiti remained one of the world's poorest countries. With some notable exceptions, the NGOs haven't worked together, and they haven't worked with Haitian authorities. Collectively, private aid organizations have constituted a parallel government that has not coordinated its efforts or been accountable in any way to the Haitian citizenry. Of course, Haiti's own elected governments have been weak and have suffered from corruption — the usual excuse for not working with Haiti's leaders. But it is obvious that any organization that is really interested in helping Haiti must include Haitian authorities in all projects and employ and train Haitians.\n\nZL calls this approach “accompaniment.” It has served as the guiding principle of the organization for decades. One recent story suggests that it could play the same guiding role in Haiti's reconstruction. The University Hospital in Port-au-Prince, the city's largest hospital, was a far from exemplary place before the earthquake, mainly because it had been grossly underfunded for decades. After the earthquake, about three quarters of its buildings were either demolished or unsafe. Yet it was revived into a functioning surgical center by an impromptu group of Haitians and foreigners, which included the hospital's Haitian director and head nurse, a Haitian staff that returned to work gradually, and 10 foreign medical organizations. A Franco-American couple, Dr. Mark Hyman and Dr. Pier Boutin, deserve credit for getting surgeries under way. Teams from the International Medical Corps, the Canadian and Norwegian Red Cross, Médecins du Monde, Mount Sinai Hospital of New York, Dartmouth–Hitchcock Healthcare System, Partners Healthcare, and others all worked in concert. A pair of PIH doctors and a PIH volunteer, Jim Ansara, performed a great deal of the logistic work.\n\nOne crucial role was played by Dr. Evan Lyon of Harvard Medical School, who had spent the better part of a decade as a physician for ZL but had recently been caring for an underserved population in rural Alabama. When Lyon arrived back in Haiti 4 days after the earthquake, Farmer asked him to coordinate all the different NGOs gathered at the University Hospital — “to make sure,” as Lyon put it, “that nobody made their own decisions, but that all of us were led by the Haitians.”\n\nClinicians who worked there reported that the effort ran with a minimum of fuss, without turf wars among the various groups, and that the hospital's Haitian leaders took the lead. I recently asked the hospital's director, Dr. Alix Lassegue, whether in his experience NGOs tend to bypass Haitian authorities. They did indeed, he said. “But with Dr. Lyon's help, I was able to prevent some NGOs from doing just what they wanted. The good thing was that he could speak Creole. He had the experience of working in Haiti.” Dr. Lassegue continued: “It was an unusual experience, the help from Zanmi Lasante. I had them join my managerial team and discuss how to handle a difficult situation.

Type "Haiti" into Twitter, Facebook or Youtube and you soon encounter a message from @redcross sent at 05:38 GMT on Jan 13. In less than 48 hours, the American Red Cross had received more than $35m in donations - including $8m directly from texts. "This breaks all world records for a mobile giving campaign," says their spokeswoman, Gloria Huang. "It\'s been incredible. People have donated more to Haiti than to Hurricane Katrina or the tsunami in Asia. "And Twitter has played an extremely significant part." Mass mobilisation In the race to fundraise, social network sites have given aid agencies the power to bypass TV and radio and appeal directly to the public. The Haitian musician Wyclef Jean, for example, has raised $1m for earthquake victims through his Yele Haiti foundation, after appealing for help through Twitter. We tweeted... celebrities re-tweeted... and after that, the appeal spread like wildfire\n\nWendy Harman, American Red Cross In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, he tweeted, asking for donations through his foundation. His 1.3 million followers answered his call - and passed on his appeal with a message: "Spread the word". Meanwhile on Facebook, hundreds of thousands of people signed up to awareness groups, such as Earthquake Haiti, which offers a link to Oxfam\'s Haiti relief fund. On Youtube, the video sharing site, bloggers began posting their own personal appeals, calling for donations. So, how was this mass mobilisation achieved? After all, the American Red Cross had only a modest number of followers on Twitter when their appeal was launched. Their trick was to alert popular celebrities - and let their fans on Twitter do the rest. "Our plan worked exactly like it was supposed to," says Wendy Harman, social media manager, at the American Red Cross. My worry was - are people just re-tweeting? Or are they actually donating?\n\nWendy Harman American Red Cross "We have a \'cabinet\' of 30 celebrities, who have agreed to ask their Twitter followers to spread the word. "Within three hours of the earthquake, we had our text number ready. "We tweeted. The celebrities re-tweeted. And then others quickly followed. People like Michelle Obama, Jane Seymour and Craig Newmark (of Craigslist) got on board. And after that, the appeal spread like wildfire." Trending topic Twitter users across the globe began using the RT (re-tweet) function to pass the message on to their friends and followers. Within hours, the number for the text appeal: "90999" was ranked among Twitter\'s top 10 "trending topics" - which in turn drove more and more people to donate and spread the word. Wyclef Jean raised $1m through his Yele Hait Foundation appeal "We hit that magical viral sweet spot," says Ms Harman. "Everybody out there seems to know that if you text 90999 you donate $10 to the Haiti appeal. "My worry was - are people just re-tweeting? Or are they actually donating? It soon became clear that they really were texting and calling." Using an online map tool, hosted by Mgive.com, she and her colleagues were able to watch as donations flooded in from every US state. They did not even have to re-send their appeal. The online community were busy spreading the word for them. "People have been sceptical over the power of the RT (re-tweet) and of Twitter generally," says Ms Harman. "For example, during the Iran election there was a viral campaign to change your avatar colour to green. "But this time, people seemed to be saying: \'Let\'s not do anything cute - let\'s just donate\'. "I think we have crossed the threshold of novelty with Twitter. People now want to use it to get something good done." Promises promises But of course, as with any appeal for charity, people\'s good will can easily be exploited. The avalanche of tweets, emails and Facebook groups urging web users to donate carries with it an opportunity for internet fraudsters to profit. Any money sent using the instructions in this email would end up in the pockets of a cyber criminal\n\nCon Mallon, Symantec Would-be donors have stumbled on some suspicious websites. On Facebook, a group has been founded with a pledge to donate $1 for every person who joins. The group has gathered more than 500,000 members. But since it has no administrators, it is not clear who, if anyone, will actually donate the promised money. Meanwhile, the security firm Symantec alerted web users to an email scam, soliciting donations for Haiti victims, which purports to come from the British Red Cross (BRC). "The scammers have used the correct postal address, but the BRC does not use Western Union for donations," said Con Mallon, a Symantec spokesman. "Also, the email address supplied as a contact is not one belonging to the BRC and any money sent using the instructions in this email would end up in the pockets of a cyber criminal." This "appeal" email was identified as a scam by Symantec security firm\n\nThe US Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a warning on Wednesday calling on internet users "to apply a critical eye and do their due diligence" before responding to online requests for aid to Haiti. "Make contributions directly to known organisations rather than relying on others to make the donation on your behalf to ensure contributions are received and used for intended purposes," the FBI said in its advisory. Amid the mass of appeals for help sent round on Twitter, even some very expert Tweeters have fallen victim to rumour and misinformation. Jennifer Preston, social media editor of the New York Times, passed on a tweet to her followers, stating: "American Airlines is taking doctors and nurses to #Haiti for free. Please call 212-697-9767. Spread the word". However, not long afterwards, she sent her fans a follow up message. "We are now hearing that it might not be true..." she tweeted. "LESSON LEARNED: do not RT offers to help... unless you confirm."\n\n\n\nBookmark with: Delicious\n\nDigg\n\nreddit\n\nFacebook\n\nStumbleUpon What are these?

The benefit concert took place in New York, Los Angeles, London and Haiti, and is being screened again on UK TV channel MTV and its sister channel Viva from 2100 GMT on Saturday. Clooney, who organised the event, said: "At the core of every religion is the belief that we care for one another, we take care of each other especially in times of need. "The Haitian people need our help, they need to know they\'re not alone, they need to know that that we still care." The telethon\'s organisers were hoping for a record global audience. Its performances from London included Beyonce singing her hit Halo, accompanied on the piano by Coldplay\'s Chris Martin. She changed the lyrics, and sang "Haiti we can see your halo, we pray you won\'t fade away". Jay Z also debuted a song, Stranded (Haiti Mon Amour) with U2\'s Bono and The Edge. Coldplay\'s Chris Martin and Beyonce Knowles dueted It featured Jay Z rapping about the earthquake while Bono and singer Rihanna\'s lyrics included "Not going to leave you stranded." As well as musical collaborations, the show broadcast shocking images from the earthquake and interviews with Haitians. More than 100 Hollywood and music stars took part. Some of them performed while others, including director Steven Spielberg, singer Stevie Wonder and TV star Ellen DeGeneres, took telephone pledges from viewers. The line-up featured the cream of Hollywood, including Clint Eastwood, Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, Brad Pitt, Robert De Niro, Matt Damon, Cameron Diaz, Denzel Washington, Will Smith, Robert Pattinson, Halle Berry, Julia Roberts, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Tim Robbins, Ben Stiller, Michael Keaton, Tom Hanks and Michael Keaton. Actress Julia Roberts took donations from the public for the people of Haiti LA-based journalist Sandro Monetti told BBC Radio 5Live: "Hundreds of millions are pouring in from what has been a very effective telethon. "It was quite a line-up all brought together by George Clooney. "The tone was very sombre and classy, different from the upbeat nature of telethons we have in the UK. With that turnout of stars it was quite something." He added that Madonna gave $250,000 (£155,000), Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie gave $1m (£620,000) and supermodel Giselle Bundchen gave $1.5m (£0.93m). Clooney had donated $1m during the telethon, his spokesman told Reuters news agency. Actors Mel Gibson, Drew Carey, George Clooney and Daniel Craig were at the gig Actor Leonardo DiCaprio signed a cheque for $1m to the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund, which was started by former presidents Bill Clinton and George W Bush. Haitian-born rapper Wyclef Jean - who set up the charity foundation Yele Haiti - Bruce Springsteen, Jennifer Hudson, Mary J Blige and Shakira performed in New York. Madonna sang Like A Prayer with the backing of a choir, while Sting sang Driven To Tears. Rihanna, meanwhile, performed a cover version of Bob Marley\'s Redemption Song, which she has released to raise money for the people of Haiti. The live programme could be seen online via YouTube, MySpace, Hulu, Fancast, AOL, MSN, Yahoo!, Bing.com, BET.com, MTV.com, CNN.com, VH1.com and Rhapsody.

The finances of the Yele Haiti Foundation were questioned last week after it was revealed it had paid Jean, 37, to perform at fund-raising events and bought advertising air time from a television station he co-owns.

Last weekend\'s earthquake was unquestionably damaging. At 8.8 on the Richter scale, it was also almost a hundred times more powerful than January\'s quake in Haiti. Thankfully, its epicenter was farther from large urban centers than the Haitian quake\'s was; also Chile has slowly recovered from its violent coup d\'état that ushered in a round of neoliberalism. (In fact, Chile was its first laboratory - U. of Chicago economist Milton Friedman was the official economic advisor to dictator Augusto Pinochet just months after the coup). While Haiti fades from the headlines, the situation on the ground in Haiti remains urgent, as only a third of the survivors have their needs for a temporary dry shelter met.\n\nWhile it is absolutely true that Chile, like the U.S., has its share of poverty and inequality, Haiti\'s development indicators are and were much worse than Chile\'s. For example, Haiti\'s Gross Domestic Product per person was $428 in 2005, while Chile\'s per capita GDP was $8,350 in 2007. Half of Haiti\'s people earn $1 per day or less, whereas only 2 percent of Chile\'s citizens live under the "international poverty line" of $1.25 per day. The latest figures for child mortality are instructive: 74 children out of 1,000 die in Haiti whereas only nine do in Chile. For all these reasons, Haiti ranked 149th out of 182 countries on the U.N.\'s Human Development Index (HDI), whereas Chile ranked 44th.\n\nThe explanations for these differences are many, but they cluster around two major themes. The first theme -- much more widely researched, repeated, published, spread, promoted, and believed by international agencies, mainstream media, and most members of certain academic disciplines -- is that Haiti\'s failures of development are because of an unbroken legacy of dictators, Haiti\'s "kleptocracy" (Fatton, 2002; Rotberg, 2003). There is an implicit binary frame of a "good" civil society and a "bad" state. Missing from this discussion is the role of foreign actors.\n\nAnother binary frame which talks past this first comes from Haiti solidarity advocates and other scholars who have closer relationships on the ground, that Haiti has been the victim of numerous occupations, a usurious debt that France claimed in exchange for its recognition of Haiti\'s independence, etc. Close observers of the last coup in Haiti would note that it was France\'s Chirac, not Bush, that first called for Aristide to resign. Many believe that this is because of Aristide\'s demand that France pay some $22 billion in reparations for this extortion.\n\nThe problem with some variants of this analysis is that if we do not acknowledge the role of Haiti\'s state we are powerless to respond to softball questions from the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee and others. The recent news item that the government of Haiti has begun taxing aid coming into Haiti is a good case for the need for a more appropriate frame of analysis, that most people within Haiti have, that acknowledges three sets of actors: the world system in all its guises, the elites and Haiti\'s state apparatus, and Haiti\'s people organized in social movements and what might be called "civil society."\n\nMeanwhile, Haiti\'s crisis continues though it has faded from mainstream media coverage. It has literally disappeared from the front page, even of progressive websites like CommonDreams. We may be entering a world of "aid fatigue." Monday was the last day for donations to emergency relief efforts to count on individuals\' 2009 taxes. The funds raised - though small compared to the urgent and long-term reconstruction needs -- are indeed generous. As of a month after the earthquake the estimate of aid donated is $600 million for Haiti relief efforts (compare this to the $20 billion in Wall Street bonuses).\n\nAnd yet, there are still an estimated 600,000 people today who are not covered when the rainy seasons come. According to aid agencies\' own estimates, only 35% of the needs for tents and tarps in Port-au-Prince is being met -- and this up from 30% a week and a half ago. While the rains haven\'t come yet, they surely will. I join many others in asking why this is, especially given this outpouring of generosity.\n\nOne problem -- lack of coordination -- appears to be on its way to being resolved. The U.N. Office of the Special Envoy for Haiti has created a website that allows donors, NGOs, and grassroots organizations to coordinate their efforts. It does have a wiki function which means that the groups doing the work can post what they are doing, and smaller, grassroots efforts are invited to use this tool as well as the large NGOs. It behooves everyone who is offering aid to use this tool, a directory of Civil Society Organizations: http://csohaiti.org/\n\nThis is only a single tool, and it can\'t solve everything by itself. Still left to be addressed is the communication with the survivors receiving the aid. More than a month and a half after the earthquake there are still many people who do not know if the aid is trickling their way. Some people like my friend Lesley wonder whether this isn\'t part of some big plan to wipe poor people out of Port-au-Prince altogether. Already the government is telling people to leave Champs-de-Mars, the "National Mall" which houses the National Palace and return to their neighborhoods (that presumably they left because aid was not arriving). And donors and grassroots efforts alike seem to be telling people to quit the city of Port-au-Prince. This is irresponsible for a couple of reasons. First, many Port-au-Prince residents, particularly the youth in the shantytowns, grew up in Port-au-Prince. Half of the country\'s population is 15 or younger. Secondly, without quick and sustainable job creation, this migration simply displaces the problem of food security into the remote rural areas, already marginalized because of communications and physical infrastructure.\n\nA second challenge we need to issue the NGOs that have been entrusted by our government and generous citizens is to also answer some basic questions about the aid they are delivering. Particularly in face of this aid fatigue, NGOs and other groups who are collecting money must do things differently than they have in the past. The first thing this particular NGO researcher and Haiti solidarity activist would like to see immediately stop is what we community organizers used to call "poverty pimping" or what could be called lately "disaster voyeurism." The seemingly innocent "real world" depictions of the actually existing poverty have real material consequences. True, a naked child with a distended belly or the overwhelming image of a city in ruins might trigger generosity in the moment. But it does Haitian people, particularly the survivors, a disservice in the short, medium, and long term. First and foremost it continues in the unbroken tradition since the Haitian Revolution of reviling, "monkeying," belittling, infantilizing, and further brutalizing Haitian people. Haiti\'s bad press is powerful: of 1200 people I polled in guest lectures before I stopped this practice, only one had a positive first impression of Haiti. This belief that Haiti is unfit to govern itself and is not deserving of urgently needed aid may be contributing to a backlash, at the very least a drying up of private donations. I hope not. At the very least this discourse has also justified several foreign occupations.\n\nAnother reason this practice of framing Haiti within this poverty voyeurism narrative is that it hides critical, life-saving information about the plan on the ground, what exact aid will actually arrive in Haiti and what its impact will be. In my first public post after the earthquake, before I went to Haiti, I offered a list of questions for people to ask when considering donating to Haiti. Given the proliferation of fundraising efforts, this is becoming even more crucial. Before giving direct aid to Haiti or choosing a group to receive funds, we need to do our homework. It is our responsibility to really think through these questions:\n\n1) Who, exactly, is on the ground delivering aid in Port-au-Prince? How do they select partners and leaders within these groups?\n\n2) What is the group\'s capacity to get aid to Haiti and directly to the impacted groups?\n\n3) What relationships do they have with the community and community groups? Who sets the priorities? Do they have long-term partnerships or are they grasping at straws?\n\n4) What percent of funds will actually get to Haiti? What percent is overhead?\n\n5) What is the plan? Does it address the current needs (medical first, food, water and shelter)?\n\n6) Is it offering direct response or is it an "umbrella" group funding local partners? How are local partners chosen?\n\nUntil these questions are all answered it is frankly irresponsible to collect funds. For those NGOs and mission groups collecting funds, it would be good to include this information on the website to make it easier for people who would like to contribute or organize fundraisers. Also in the interests of accountability it would be good to post the organization\'s most recent 990 form required by U.S. law for all nonprofit groups in order to maintain their tax-exempt status. This form -- already required by law to be furnished to all U.S. taxpayers who ask for it -- lists the major sources of income and expenses for the organization.\n\nI know this sounds harsh, especially to people who never think to question their generosity. At a recent conference in New Orleans (more on this in a future post) senior scholar in another field critiqued a 12-minute presentation based on my previous post that an anthropologist who is "too close to the field" could not be "scientific" or at least "methodical." My response to him and the audience is, like it or not, the data are clear: neoliberalism has failed Haiti. All development indicators have seen a steady decline from 1980 to 2007, as of the last data I methodically examined, except for two. These two indicators -- the incidence of HIV/AIDS and literacy -- are exceptions precisely because they were mutual priorities of the elected governments of Haiti and donor groups. Since the 1995 Dole Amendment, USAID was prevented from funding the government of Haiti, a manifestation of a divided U.S. government and the U.S. government\'s mistrust of Haiti\'s elected governments of Aristide and Préval. However, because it was a priority, USAID was allowed to work with Haiti\'s government on HIV/AIDS. Haiti\'s success in combating the disease is a ray of hope: in just over a decade since 1993, the seroprevalence went from 6.2 percent to about 3.2 percent.\n\nThis political conflict added fuel to the already-hot fire of neoliberalism, in the so-called "Washington Consensus" that donor groups like the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, and USAID imposed on countries in the Global South like Haiti. One major plank in neoliberalism is a distrust of states and a preference for private-sector initiatives and the elusive concept of "civil society." Since the 1980s, NGOs have proliferated in Haiti and elsewhere. The 1990s saw a tenfold increase in their numbers, from 6,000 worldwide in 1990 to an estimated 60,000 by 1998 (Economist, cited in Regan 2003:3). Currently, there are so many NGOs that we can\'t even guess at their number (Riddell, 2007:53). This rise in the number of NGOs is matched with an increase in funding through them. Globally, in 2005, it is estimated that NGOs channeled anywhere from 3.7 to 7.8 billion U.S. dollars of "humanitarian assistance" (Development Initiatives, 2006:47), and 24 billion in overall development funding (Riddell, 2007:259).\n\nThe pattern is true in Haiti, with only 74 NGOs out of an official count of 343 being present before the dechoukaj, before the ouster of foreign-supported dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier. Noted above, all of USAID funds go through NGOs. A senior U.N. official recently estimated that for all donors 90 percent of aid goes directly to NGOs. Haitian researcher Sauveur Pierre Étienne called this situation an "Invasion." All this is to say, whereas NGOs may not have created this neoliberal framework, they accepted in infusion of official government aid - known in the field as "Overseas Development Assistance." Like it or not, the fact that NGOs accepted and continue to seek out more of this aid to preside over the development system makes NGOs accountable for its clear failure in Haiti.\n\nWith all due respect to my conference discussant and a wave of newly-minted Haiti "experts," the facts not only speak for themselves, they shout. As a structure -- yes, there are notable exceptions -- NGOs have failed Haiti, particularly the pèp la, Haiti\'s poor majority. Most pèp la I know are deeply suspicious of NGOs: their employees have the biggest houses, biggest offices, biggest white SUVs, newest computers, etc. Many people have commented on a steady rise in housing costs as a direct result of occupying forces and NGOs paying inflated rents. NGOs have become the backbone of the middle class -- in fact, they are becoming a new status group, an "NGO class" in the eyes of many. As my friend Télèfe said, "as long as the aid passes through the bigwigs, we poor won\'t see a cent."\n\nI can almost hear people retort with the popular refrain: but what about the failures of the Haitian state, the kleptocracy? With all due respect to certain members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, that is not our affair and responsibility but Haitian peoples\' particularly the survivors. To enter a sovereign country\'s political sphere -- even or some would say especially bringing aid -- is imperialist. One way out of this approach is to take the lead of the people who have lived this long-term crisis, and adopt a more sophisticated, nuanced solidarity, a tripartite analysis like the one discussed above.\n\nGiven the multitudes of perspectives, anyone offering easy answers, especially now, should be suspect. But the long-term solution requires a rebuilt, accountable, democratic, but functioning state that receives donors\' support. Partners in Health and the RFK Memorial Center for Human Rights have published a report about the urgent need for a rights-based approach to development that includes this basic respect for the government of Haiti. An ad-hoc coalition of Washington-based NGOs has made the same point. See the CEPR blog for these and other reports.\n\nBut the subject of reconstruction can wait for another blog.\n\nIn the meantime, where are the tents?\n\nIf Haiti hasn\'t erupted into violence, it is because despite the racist misunderstandings of Haiti and Haiti\'s people, the survivors have the dignity, determination, community orientation, and togetherness that frankly we here in the U.S. need to learn. (One needs only to witness televised conflicts over the last snow shovel at Wal-Mart to see what I\'m talking about -- and if the conflict involves African-Americans or people of darker hues, a tagline like "looting").\n\nI have more hope than ever that Haitian people will survive this crisis because I have seen what Haitian people are accomplishing on their own, together. For the moment at least, in my neighborhood at least, both political and economic divisions have become the ancien régime. Every report back from the grassroots confirms this as well. By themselves, people on my block set up a medical clinic and an information gathering apparatus under a tarp my Belgian roommate left. They somehow managed to connect to the internet, and have a team of people listening to the radio. All I had to do was suggest a meeting and my neighbors drew up a map of Christ-Roi, some 25,000 people, and went about / continued collecting information about who was alive, who was dead; whose body was still trapped, whose home was still standing; what the urgent needs were, exactly how much water they had, exactly how much food, who had a car, and who had buckets to transport water, etc. And with very minimal assistance from this blan, they did get the water delivered and had lights at night.\n\nThere are approaches to offer solidarity-based assistance to survivors, who need to be directing this process. It is a very complex, difficult, heart-rending process that requires humility, self-critique, dialogue, fostering long-term relationships, and knowing our place. But it is possible. Flights to Haiti are scheduled to resume within the week. The overland route through the Dominican Republic has opened up and there are grassroots efforts beginning to work. Last week there was a conference of scores of grassroots organizations in Port-au-Prince coordinated by KONPAY to discuss strategy. In addition to her critical on-the-ground reporting, longtime Haiti solidarity activist Beverly Bell has organized an effort called Other Worlds, after the slogan of the World Social Forum. And after some fifty hours with three people and countless phone calls and e-mails, donations for the grassroots groups in documentary film Poto Mitan are finally going to Haiti through fiscal agent Lambi Fund.\n\nBut it is the Haitian survivors who are the heroes of this story, whose perspective needs to be central throughout this process. Their needs articulated (like tents, tarps, and/or more solid makeshift homes, and food Haitian people would prepare themselves) need to direct the aid that is coming.\n\nThis difference in perspective, this fault line, is not merely an intellectual concern. We who plan on standing by the side of Haitian people who are rebuilding their country need to learn our place and to learn how to offer this aid in the way that the survivors want.\n\nHopefully, the fault lines will not grow throughout the reconstruction process.\n\nMark Schuller is Assistant Professor of African American Studies and Anthropology at York College, the City University of New York.

The ceiling was inexplicably festooned with plastic bags and scraps of cloth. I had obtained access to the prison to investigate the aftermath of the mass jailbreak that occurred during the devastating earthquake that hit Haiti on 12 January. More than 4,000 prisoners broke out of the central prison when the walls cracked and the prison guards fled to their homes to see if their families were alive. About 1,000 more fled from regional jails which suffered a similar fate. "It\'s certainly one of the largest prison escapes of recent history," said Paul Biddle, a former UK prison officer now advising the British government\'s Department for International Development on how to help rebuild Haiti\'s jails. Only parts of Haiti\'s National Penitentiary are still standing "In my experience of over 30 years there has never been an escape of this magnitude." Mr Biddle has also worked in jails in Afghanistan, Iraq and the Palestinian territories. In the chapel, my eyes were slowly getting used to the gloom and it dawned on me that this former place of worship had in fact been a grossly overcrowded communal cell. Hanging from the ceiling on lengths of string were hundreds of grubby plastic bags and water containers. The floor was knee deep in filthy mattresses and rags. But as I looked up to the ceiling again I saw that, competing for space with the plastic bags, were foul-smelling hammocks. Then a prison officer told me how many men had been held in this chapel-turned-cell roughly the size of a tennis court - and it all began to make sense to me. "Three hundred and eighty-six in the chapel," the prison officer said. The overcrowding was clearly so inhuman that the prisoners did not have enough room to exist on the floor. So some had slept in hammocks suspended from the ceiling. Deadly scramble There were no toilets that I could see there. So I can only assume that the plastic containers hanging on string were to keep the dank drinking water they contained from the sewage at ground level. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement No wonder that when the earthquake hit, the men smashed and scrambled their way out. Even a broken city in mass trauma was better than incarceration here. In the corner of a nearby courtyard some of the escapees had strung together the classic comic-book-style rope made of bed sheets to make their way to a parapet wall. But there was nothing comical about the scene. On the concrete floor - among the rags, the abandoned Bibles and the strewn playing cards - were the stains left by the bodily fluids of four men who died in the chaos. Their bodies had putrefied and burst in the heat before the Red Cross came to take them away. They may have been killed by masonry falling from the crumbling walls or they may have had a fight. We will probably never know. Several pairs of plastic slippers lay abandoned on the stained concrete floor. The Haitian authorities have recaptured only 200 of the 5,000 prisoners who escaped. But they are pleased that they have at least made a start. They are holding the 200 in a corner of the central prison relatively undamaged by the earthquake. I toured the jail with Frantz Charles Dehonnet, deputy director of Haiti\'s penitentiary services. "We had to re-establish part of the prison to give the police confidence that they have somewhere to put people they have arrested," he said. Frantz Charles Dehonnet (r) says the jail reassures the people of Haiti "We also want to give the people the reassurance that the system of justice is being re-built, because as soon as the jailbreak occurred there was an upsurge in criminality and fear. We want to tell the people we are rebuilding justice." Unfortunately, Mr Dehonnet - who appeared to be a frank and intelligent man - left the prison for another meeting before I had understood the conditions of incarceration in the chapel. Questions to the Haitian authorities about this outrage will have to wait for another day. But I left the national penitentiary with two impressions. The first was the nightmarish chaos and violence that must have ensued when a massive earthquake hits a large jail. The second impression was of the dreadful conditions that the inmates - many of whom were on remand, not having been properly convicted of any crime - endured before the quake. Haiti\'s prison service has been offered help to rebuild and manage its jails from experts at the International Committee of the Red Cross, and from Canada and Britain. The earthquake has left a legacy of fear and thousands of alleged criminals on the loose. But what I saw in the central prison of conditions before the quake hit showed that the entire system of justice and the entire philosophy of rehabilitation of offenders needs rebuilding. Justice needs strong walls that can withstand an earthquake. But Haiti has a lot more to fix than that.\n\n\n\nBookmark with: Delicious\n\nDigg\n\nreddit\n\nFacebook\n\nStumbleUpon What are these?

They returned home after winding up a two-week emergency aid and epidemic control mission in quake-stricken Haiti, bring help and succour to countless victims of the disaster. [China Daily]\n\nThe last 30 days since the devastating earthquake in Haiti have not only witnessed the suffering and fortitude of the Haitian people, but also the borderless love of the international community.\n\nAs a major developing country, China actively joined the world-scale disaster relief efforts and exhibited a glorious humanitarian spirit.\n\nThe 7.3-magnitude earthquake in the afternoon of Jan 12 ruined the capital Port-au-Prince and killed thousands of people in a moment.\n\n"The whole city sank into darkness. People were running, crying or screaming on the street with nowhere to go," said an official from an international charity group.\n\n"There are no people, no medicines, no explanations. There is nothing... Who can tell me why my daughter should die like this?" cried a mother who was holding her dying daughter in her arms outside a hospital.\n\nThe world heard the cry for help from the heavily damaged Caribbean nation and took immediate action. In addition to the $10 million in emergency aid announced by the United Nations, rescue teams and materials were sent to Haiti from across the world.\n\nAs soon as news of the disaster reached China, the Chinese leadership ordered related departments to be prepared to give assistance.\n\nIn the early morning of Jan 14 local time, a Chinese chartered airplane carrying 60 rescuers and doctors as well as equipment and medicine landed at Port-au-Prince airport.\n\nThe Chinese rescuers set to work as soon as they reached the headquarters of the UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti. There, the Chinese peacekeeping police officers who had been stationed in Haiti and survived the earthquake had pulled several people out of the rubble.\n\n"We couldn\'t waste time thinking about safety instead of saving lives because it would have been too late if we waited," said Wang Xueyan, who worked with her Canadian colleague Martin to rescue five people in two hours after the quake.\n\nWang said she walked out of the building 10 minutes before its collapse in the earthquake.\n\nAfter about 36 hours of continuous work, the Chinese rescuers dug out the bodies of the mission chief, vice-chief and eight Chinese peacekeeping police officers. They were attending a meeting in the building at the time of the quake.\n\nMoved by the spirit of the Chinese rescue team, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said "thank you" in Chinese three times when he visited the Chinese rescuers at the site of the mission headquarters on Jan 17.\n\nSustaining the agony of losing colleagues and comrades, the Chinese rescuers moved to other badly damaged sites to look for traces of life.\n\n"We made 200-percent effort on the slightest hope," said Wang Zhiqiu, vice team leader of the Chinese rescue team.', 'title': "China's response to Haiti quake praised", 'url': 'http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/haitiearthquake/2010-03/01/content_9519415.htm', 'keywords': ['chinese', 'praised', 'response', 'china', 'quake', 'team', 'rescue', 'chinas', 'haiti', 'international', 'earthquake', 'mission', 'jan', 'rescuers'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'China FocusChina\'s response to Haiti quake praised (China Daily)Updated: 2010-03-01 13:52Nation has provided Caribbean country with $7 million in assistance and aidMembers of the Chinese medical team arrive at Beijing Capital International Airport.\nThe Chinese rescuers set to work as soon as they reached the headquarters of the UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti.\nAfter about 36 hours of continuous work, the Chinese rescuers dug out the bodies of the mission chief, vice-chief and eight Chinese peacekeeping police officers.\nSustaining the agony of losing colleagues and comrades, the Chinese rescuers moved to other badly damaged sites to look for traces of life.\n"We made 200-percent effort on the slightest hope," said Wang Zhiqiu, vice team leader of the Chinese rescue team.', 'date': 1267401600}, {'text': 'The Obama administration said today that tens of thousands of illegal Haitian immigrants can remain temporarily in the U.S. while their country rebuilds after Tuesday\'s devastating earthquake.\n\nThe announcement to grant "temporary protective status," or TPS, to Haitian nationals allows immigrants already in the U.S. to live and work freely here until conditions in Haiti improve. After 18 months the status could be revoked.\n\n"This is a disaster of historic proportions and this designation will allow eligible Haitian nationals in the United States to continue living and working in our country for the next 18 months," Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced late today on a conference call. "Providing a temporary refuge for Haitian nationals who are currently in the United States and whose personal safety would be endangered by returning to Haiti is part of this Administration\'s continuing efforts to support Haiti\'s recovery."\n\nPlay\n\nNapolitano estimated that there are 100,000 to 200,000 Haitian nationals currently in the country illegally.\n\n"TPS gives them sort of an intermediate immigration status," said the secretary. "It allows them -- only for a period of 18 months, while Haiti gets back on its feet -- to remain in the United States and authorizes them to work during that period, among other things."\n\nEarlier this week the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement decided to halt all deportations to Haiti, but they stopped short of implementing TPS.\n\nPlay\n\nThe administration\'s decision to grant this protection to Haitians with orders to leave is almost certain to fan the flames of the ongoing immigration debate.\n\nWhile several liberal groups and members of Congress had urged the administration to declare TPS for Haitians, conservative immigration groups, as well as a Republican congressman, had said such a move would amount to a slippery slope to "amnesty."\n\n"This sounds to me like open borders advocates exercising the Rahm Emanuel axiom: \'Never let a crisis go to waste,\'" Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, said in an e-mail message to ABCNews. "Illegal immigrants from Haiti have no reason to fear deportation, but if they are deported, Haiti is in great need of relief workers, and many of them could be a big help to their fellow Haitians."\n\nPlay\n\nBy law, the secretary of Homeland Security can offer temporary protected status to illegal immigrants of a particular nationality if calamities such as natural disasters or war make it too burdensome for their home countries to receive them.\n\nEl Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Somalia and Sudan currently have temporary protective status designations.\n\nImmigrants without criminal records and residing in the United States at the time the new status is extended simply pay a fee to apply for temporary protected status and then receive protection for up to 18 months.\n\nPlay\n\nGranting Protected Status to Haitians Likely to Stir Immigration Debate\n\nEven though temporary protected status, by itself, does not lead to permanent resident status or a green card, the government can -- and often does -- renew it repeatedly as conditions warrant. That troubles immigration opponents.\n\n"Apparently, there\'s nothing temporary about a temporary protected status order, and we do not want to see millions of Haitian refugees permanently transplanted to the United States in the middle of the economic nightmare we\'re in the middle of," William Gheen, president of the conservative Americans for Legal Immigration PAC, said.\n\nPlay\n\nDan Stein, president of the conservative Federation for American Immigration Reform, said in a statement that while he supports temporary suspension of deportations to Haiti , temporary protective status has been abused in the past.\n\n"It is incumbent upon our national leaders to not only act compassionately but to act responsibly," he said. "In some cases, such as TPS for citizens of El Salvador, the triggering event occurred nearly a decade ago."\n\nWhile some of the most conservative opponents of illegal immigration oppose temporary protected status, several Republicans support its extension to Haitians. Shortly after Tuesday\'s quake, Reps. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Mario Diaz-Balart -- all GOP House members from Florida -- sent a letter to President Obama reiterating their earlier pleas for TPS for Haitians.\n\nPlay\n\n"The combined destruction from today\'s catastrophic earthquake and the previous storms clearly makes forced repatriation of Haitians hazardous to their safety at this time. We strongly believe that it is for such a situation that Congress created TPS," the letter read.\n\nRep. Alcee Hastings, a Florida Democrat, went further Wednesday, saying it is "not only immoral but irresponsible to continue to deny Haitians TPS."\n\nStill, given the politically charged immigration debate, the administration\'s decision to grant even "temporary" relief to thousands of illegal immigrants was not made lightly.\n\nThe Obama administration, like the Bush administration before it, had denied Haitians\' repeated previous requests for temporary protective status since the fall of 2008, after four hurricanes and tropical storms killed hundreds of people, destroyed Haiti\'s food crops and caused nearly $1 billion in damage.\n\nPlay\n\nNapolitano called the administration\'s action today "an act of compassion among other things," signaling just how serious the circumstances on the ground in Haiti have become.\n\nABC News\' Jason Ryan contributed to this report.', 'title': 'Haiti Earthquake: Haitians in U.S. Illegally Get Protected Status After Quake', 'url': 'https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/HaitiEarthquake/haiti-earthquake-illegal-haitians-protected-status-quake/story?id=9570995', 'keywords': ['states', 'illegally', 'tps', 'immigration', 'status', 'haitian', 'protected', 'quake', 'haitians', 'earthquake', 'haiti', 'united', 'temporary'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': '"TPS gives them sort of an intermediate immigration status," said the secretary.\nImmigrants without criminal records and residing in the United States at the time the new status is extended simply pay a fee to apply for temporary protected status and then receive protection for up to 18 months.\nPlayGranting Protected Status to Haitians Likely to Stir Immigration DebateEven though temporary protected status, by itself, does not lead to permanent resident status or a green card, the government can -- and often does -- renew it repeatedly as conditions warrant.\nWhile some of the most conservative opponents of illegal immigration oppose temporary protected status, several Republicans support its extension to Haitians.\nRep.

Dr. Hough said that in addition to the destruction at the Hotel Montana, home to many foreign visitors, 7,000-pound battery racks at a cellphone facility farther west on the ridge shifted more than a foot.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut there was little data on local ground motion during the earthquake, which killed 230,000 people, according to official estimates. At the time, Dr. Hough said, Haiti had just one seismometer, an educational instrument that was improperly mounted. “When the earthquake happened, it went dancing around on its little feet,” she said. “It did make a record, but it wasn’t very useful.”\n\nSo Dr. Hough, with help from scientists with the Bureau of Mines and Energy in Haiti, installed eight portable seismometers, including two on the ridge and two in an adjacent valley, and used them to measure ground movement during some of the many aftershocks that have followed the earthquake. They found that the shaking along the ridge was more severe than in the valley, so it cannot be explained by amplification in sedimentary rocks that underlie the valley.\n\nDr. Hough likened the shaking along the ridge to that which can occur in a skyscraper. “If you start shaking a long, skinny ridge, it sways back and forth, like a big building,” she said. The seismic waves reflect internally within the wedgelike geometric structure of the ridge, combining to produce higher peak forces, a process called constructive interference.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

And future earthquakes on or near the same fault are inevitable, seismologists say. “Potentially you can say, ‘You should build over here, and not there,’ ” she said.\n\nDr. Hough said that even on the ridge, with its severe shaking, some well-built and well-anchored homes and other buildings survived the earthquake practically undamaged. “It shows that you can build safely, even in zones like that,” she said. “You just have to know what you’re up against.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“The good news is that we can characterize the shaking,” she added. “We can design for it.”", 'title': 'Haiti Quake Intensity Was Affected by Local Terrain, Study Finds', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/19/science/19quake.html', 'keywords': ['scientists', 'study', 'intensity', 'dr', 'quake', 'earthquake', 'local', 'severe', 'haiti', 'help', 'shaking', 'finds', 'terrain', 'affected', 'ridge', 'hough', 'york'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': '“Sedimentary layers are what people understand.”There were indications from the earthquake damage that the ridge, in the suburb of Pétionville, had undergone severe shaking.\nPhotoBut there was little data on local ground motion during the earthquake, which killed 230,000 people, according to official estimates.\nAt the time, Dr. Hough said, Haiti had just one seismometer, an educational instrument that was improperly mounted.\nDr. Hough likened the shaking along the ridge to that which can occur in a skyscraper.\nDr. Hough said that even on the ridge, with its severe shaking, some well-built and well-anchored homes and other buildings survived the earthquake practically undamaged.', 'date': 1287446400}, {'text': 'Please enable cookies on your web browser in order to continue.\n\nThe new European data protection law requires us to inform you of the following before you use our website:\n\nWe use cookies and other technologies to customize your experience, perform analytics and deliver personalized advertising on our sites, apps and newsletters and across the Internet based on your interests.

Up to 250,000 people have been killed, and up to $14 billion in damage has been caused by the quake, which rated a 7.0 on the Richter scale.\n\nThe IDB report used regression analysis on data collected from 2,000 natural disasters that occurred worldwide between 1970 and 2008. Examining the effects of the disasters on the countries in which they took place, the authors of the IDB report were able to predict the cost of damages for “a country with Haiti’s economic and demographic characteristics.” As the report states, “The nature of the exercise we perform is simple. It uses historical data on catastrophic events and econometric techniques to answer the following question: what are the expected costs of reconstructing Haiti’s infrastructure?”\n\nA scene from the devastation in Haiti\n\nAt the very least, the report concludes, it would cost $8.1 billion to restore the infrastructure of a country with Haiti’s “observable characteristics” that has suffered a natural disaster causing a death toll of 250,000. The report indicates that the cost is, in reality, likely to be far higher, reaching up to $14 billion in damages. To put the sums in greater context, Haiti was already the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere when the earthquake struck in January; its GDP is just $6.95 billion per year.\n\n“There are few events of such ferocity as the Haiti 2010 earthquake,” says the report. “It is the most destructive event a country has ever experienced when measured in terms of the number of people killed as a share of the country’s population, and it has affected the capital city of the country: the center of commerce, government and communication.”\n\nThere have been up to 25,000 people killed for every 1 million inhabitants of Haiti, a country with a total population of just over 9,780,000. This staggering ratio far outstrips even the worst disasters previously recorded, including the earthquake that struck Nicaragua in 1972, killing 10,000 people in all or 4,046 people per every million inhabitants. Until the Haiti earthquake, that disaster held the record for the most number of people killed per million inhabitants.\n\nThe disaster in Haiti has broken every record under review, making it not only the worst disaster in modern history, but the worst by far. More people were killed in the Haitian earthquake alone than were killed in the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, which claimed 226,000 lives across 12 countries. The cost of damages suffered by Haiti during the earthquake amounts to 117 percent of the country’s annual GDP. Prior to this, the record for such economic devastation was also held by the 1972 earthquake in Nicaragua, causing damages equal to 102 percent of that country’s GDP.\n\nThe scope of the disaster in Haiti is unprecedented. The IDB also makes clear that any recovery efforts, were they to be at all adequate, would also need to be unprecedented. The IDB web site reports a forthcoming study by its organization that shows “countries hit by disasters on this scale suffer an economic setback that can take decades to reverse.”\n\n“In several such countries,” the report states, “investigators found that even with big inflows of outside aid, GDP per capita was up to 30 percent lower 10 years after the disaster than it would have been if the country had been spared.”\n\nThe IDB report warns that aid could be “constrained by the capacity of institutions in Haiti to manage and execute the projects to be financed,” and goes on to say, “excellent coordination of funding and of execution will be the key to ensuring the efficient use of funds.”\n\nFar from an “excellent coordination” or execution of relief efforts, the official recovery efforts set in motion in the days and weeks following the earthquake have been a travesty, only compounding the suffering of the masses of the starving and homeless in Haiti. Emergency food and medical supplies sat untouched in airport hangers, or relief shipments were turned away altogether as the US military took control of Haiti’s only airport and gave priority to the transportation of “security” forces over essential relief supplies.\n\nWhile the numbers uncovered by the IDB report shed new light on the dimensions of this social catastrophe, they are only preliminary figures. With the rebuilding of Haiti subverted to profit interests, and the relief and recovery efforts dominated by the US military, still more devastation lies in store for the Haitian people.', 'title': 'Haiti disaster is worst in modern history', 'url': 'https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2010/02/hait-f18.html', 'keywords': ['disaster', 'relief', 'country', 'earthquake', 'killed', 'modern', 'haiti', 'haitis', 'idb', 'report', 'worst', 'history'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Haiti disaster is worst in modern historyBy Hiram Lee18 February 2010The disaster caused by the January 12 earthquake in Haiti is the worst in modern history, according to a new report by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).\nThe IDB report used regression analysis on data collected from 2,000 natural disasters that occurred worldwide between 1970 and 2008.\nUntil the Haiti earthquake, that disaster held the record for the most number of people killed per million inhabitants.\nThe disaster in Haiti has broken every record under review, making it not only the worst disaster in modern history, but the worst by far.\nWhile the numbers uncovered by the IDB report shed new light on the dimensions of this social catastrophe, they are only preliminary figures.', 'date': None}, {'text': "The scale of devastation in Haiti is far worse than in Asia after the 2004 tsunami, a study says, predicting last month's quake could be the most destructive disaster in modern history.\n\nThe stark assessment from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) on Tuesday comes with Port-au-Prince still lying in ruins more than one month on, while the bodies of more than 200,000 dead pile up in mass graves outside the capital.\n\nWill take years to rebuild ...

Some places look as though they have been flipped upside down, or are sinking to the ground, or listing precariously to one side.\n\nBy some estimates, the quake left about 33 million cubic yards of debris in Port-au-Prince — more than seven times the amount of concrete used to build the Hoover Dam. So far, only about 2 percent has been cleared, which means the city looks pretty much as it did a month after the Jan. 12 quake.\n\nGovernment officials and outside aid groups say rubble removal is the priority before Haiti can rebuild. But the reasons why so little has been cleared are complex. And frustrating.\n\nHeavy equipment has to be shipped in by sea. Dump trucks have difficulty navigating narrow and mountainous dirt roads. An abysmal records system makes it hard for the government to determine who owns a dilapidated property. And there are few sites on which to dump the rubble, which often contains human remains.\n\nAlso, no single person in the Haitian government has been declared in charge of the rubble, prompting foreign nongovernmental organizations to take on the task themselves. The groups are often forced to fight for a small pool of available money and contracts — which in turn means the work is done piecemeal, with little coordination.\n\nProjects funded by USAID and the U.S. Department of Defense have spent more than $98.5 million to remove 1.2 million cubic yards of rubble.\n\n"There\'s not a master plan," Eric Overvest, country director for the U.N. Development Program, said with a sigh. "After the earthquake, the first priority was clearing the roads. That was the easiest part."\n\nOvervest said the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission — created after the earthquake to coordinate billions of dollars in aid — has approved a $17 million plan to clear rubble from six neighborhoods in Port-au-Prince. The neighborhoods have not yet been selected, however, and it\'s unclear when debris will be removed from other areas.\n\nLeslie Voltaire, a Haitian architect, urban planner and presidential candidate, says his country needs a "rubble czar."\n\n"Everybody is passing the blame on why things haven\'t happened yet," he said. "There should be one person in charge. Resettlement has not even begun yet, and it can\'t until the city has been cleared."\n\nVoltaire maintains that there are enough crushers, dump trucks and other heavy equipment for the job; others say that more machinery is needed. But everyone agrees that recovery will take decades — and the slower the rubble removal, the longer the recovery.\n\nMost Haitians are simply living with the rubble, working and walking around it. After a while, the gray heaps and cockeyed buildings just blend into the tattered background of the city.\n\n"It will take many, many years to fix," Overvest acknowledged. "We can\'t just go with wheelbarrows to remove it."\n\nBut that\'s exactly what some Haitians are doing: using shovels and wheelbarrows to clear properties — a Sisyphean task if there ever was one.\n\n"Personally, I don\'t think Port-au-Prince will ever be cleared," said 47-year-old Yvon Clerisier, an artist working a temporary job clearing rubble with a rusty shovel for a private homeowner. He wore torn jeans, a sweaty T-shirt and sandals, and was covered in a fine dust.\n\nClerisier was one of a dozen men working in temperatures higher than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius). The property owner, Gregory Antoine, said he paid the crew $1,200 for three weeks of work.\n\n"People want to work," Antoine said. "If you get a good organization to put people to work and give them direction, things will get done. But right now, nothing is getting done."\n\nIt\'s not for lack of trying. The nonprofit organization CHF International spent about $5 million of USAID money on heavy machinery and paying Haitians to remove rubble from specific sites.\n\nDan Strode was the rubble-removal operations manager for CHF for three months; some dubbed him "the rubble guy" because of his enthusiasm for the job.\n\n"Rubble isn\'t sexy," the Californian said. "And clearing it is not as simple as people think."\n\nStrode\'s big worry: that debris won\'t be cleared fast enough and that the piles of rocks and garbage and dirt will be overtaken by tropical growth.\n\n"If we don\'t clear it, what we will leave behind is something that is worse than before," he said. "If you come back in a year, and the rubble hasn\'t been cleared, it will be grown over, subject to landslides and unstable."\n\nStrode, who coordinated the removal of nearly 290,000 cubic yards of material in three months, said a major obstacle to demolishing buildings has been the lack of property records, which either were destroyed in the quake or never existed at all.\n\nWithout an owner\'s consent, it is difficult to remove debris, he said. Another problem: Strode often received approval to demolish a building such as a hospital or a school — even when nearby homes were at risk.\n\n"You cannot wantonly go in and demolish," he said. "There\'s a liability issue."\n\nStrode is no longer doing rubble removal. The grant money ran out and has not been renewed.\n\nAnother hurdle: dumping the debris.\n\nWhile many private landowners and others are dumping the rubble in the streets, canals or countryside, there\'s only one place in all of Haiti where NGOs using U.S. money can take contaminated rubble: an approved and environmentally surveyed site.\n\n"Not all rubble is the same," said Michael Zamba, the spokesman for the Pan American Development Foundation. "There\'s a lot of contaminated rubble with human remains in it. It can\'t go in a standard landfill."\n\nZamba points out that before the earthquake, Haiti was the least-developed country in the Western Hemisphere — so it\'s not that surprising recovery is slow.\n\n"Haiti is a really expensive place to work: You have to ship in gas, vehicles, people," he said. "But you clean up the rubble in a neighborhood, and it transforms it. Life comes back."\n\n___\n\n\n\nAssociated Press Writer Evens Sanon contributed to this report.\n\n', 'title': 'Months after Haiti earthquake, cleanup has barely scratched surface of rubble piles', 'url': 'https://www.cleveland.com/world/index.ssf/2010/09/months_after_haiti_earthquake.html', 'keywords': ['removal', 'surface', 'cleanup', 'earthquake', 'months', 'money', 'haiti', 'work', 'portauprince', 'barely', 'cleared', 'remove', 'million', 'piles', 'debris', 'scratched', 'rubble'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': "Government officials and outside aid groups say rubble removal is the priority before Haiti can rebuild.\nBut everyone agrees that recovery will take decades — and the slower the rubble removal, the longer the recovery.\nThe nonprofit organization CHF International spent about $5 million of USAID money on heavy machinery and paying Haitians to remove rubble from specific sites.\nWithout an owner's consent, it is difficult to remove debris, he said.\nStrode is no longer doing rubble removal.", 'date': 1284389460}, {'text': 'The 55-year-old Hollywood star arrived as troops in Port-au-Prince struggled to maintain order two weeks after the 7.0-magnitude earthquake that left 200,000 dead and one million homeless.\n\nDesperately hungry Haitians overran a group of UN peacekeepers trying to hand out food and machete fights broke out over tents which were in desperately short supply.\n\nTravolta, accompanied by his wife, Kelly Preston, piloted his own Boeing 707 from Florida with six tons of ready-to-eat military rations and medicines.\n\nAs well as teams of surgeons, plastic surgeons, trauma specialists, and cardiologists he also brought Scientologist "volunteer ministers" who claim to be able to heal victims with the power of touch.\n\nTravolta said: "We have the ability to actually help make a difference to the situation in Haiti and I just can\'t see not using this plane to help."\n\nAmid the mass of aid agencies piling in to Haiti the Scientologists have been visible in their yellow T-shirts, fanning out among patients outside Port-au-Prince\'s General Hospital.\n\nExplaining how they heal by touch a "volunteer minister" called Sylvie said: "When you get a sudden shock to a part of your body the energy gets stuck, so we re-establish communication within the body by touching people through their clothes, and asking people to feel the touch."

He braced one arm with the other.\n\n“I was hungry,” Exantus told The Associated Press from his hospital bed soon after the rescue. “But every night I thought about the revelation that I would survive.”\n\nHe said he survived initially by diving under a desk when the rubble started to fall around him. Trapped in such a small space, he had lie on his back the entire time and survived by drinking cola, beer and cookies.\n\n“I would eat anything I found,” he said. “After the quake I didn’t know when it was day and when it was night.”\n\nOne of the man’s brothers, Jean Elit Jean Pierre, said Exantus worked as a cashier in a grocery store on the ground floor of the Hotel Napoli. The brothers persuaded rescuers to save Exantus, who has a different name because he had it changed.\n\nFrom his hospital bed Saturday, Exantus turned to his family and said, “When you are in a hole I will try to reach out to you, too.”\n\nEarlier Saturday, the United Nations announced the Haitian government had declared an end to rescue operations. Still, dozens of international teams continued to pick through rubble of the Jan. 12 quake.\n\nSaturday’s rescue effort started when one of the man’s brothers helped get a Greek search team to the site after hearing Exantus’ voice, said Apostolos Dedas, a mission leader for the Greek team.\n\n“It is very emotional. It is the best thing that can happen to you when you are a rescuer,” Dedas said.\n\nLt. Col. Christophe Renou, a French Civil Protection official who was part of the rescue team at the site, said rescuers used chain saws, heavy duty drills and hand saws to dig a narrow tunnel to the man and got him water while working to extract him. Renou said the man was buried under 16½ to 20 feet (5 to 6 meters) of debris, mostly wood and concrete.\n\nThe rescue teams said they sent two women into the tunnel because only they could fit.\n\nCarmen Michalska, a Scottish woman who is a member of the Greek team, found Exantus wedged between shelving and debris, and a French female rescuer used a saw to cut away the last bit of debris. When Exantus emerged, “He was smiling and he was just really happy to get out,” Michalska said. “He said, ’Thank you.’”\n\nRenou speculated the man survived because the building was mostly wooden, which created some air spaces. He said he was not sure if anyone else was trapped in the collapsed store and the team was using radar to check the rubble for signs of life.\n\n“What happened in that spot there is a miracle,” Renou said. “We are really happy he is alive.”\n\nRescues have become increasingly rare since the magnitude-7.0 quake leveled the city, killing an estimated 200,000 people.

"Developers, crisis mappers and even Internet-savvy folks can actually make a difference."\n\nVolunteers have built and refined software for tracking missing people, mapping the disaster area and enabling urgent cell phone text messaging. Organizations including the International Red Cross, the United Nations, the World Bank and the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency have put the systems to use.\n\nTim Schwartz, a 28-year-old artist and programmer in San Diego, feared upon learning of the disaster that, with an array of social-networking sites active, crucial information about Haitian quake victims would "go everywhere on the Internet and it would be very hard to actually find people -- and get back to their loved ones," he said. So Schwartz quickly e-mailed "all the developers I\'d ever worked with."\n\nIn a few hours, he and 10 others had built www.haitianquake.com, an online lost-and-found to help Haitians in and out of the country locate missing relatives.\n\nThe database, which anyone can update, was online less than 24 hours after the quake struck, with more than 6,000 entries because Schwartz and his colleagues wrote an "scraper" that gathered data from a Red Cross site.\n\nThe New York Times, Miami Herald, CNN and others launched similar efforts. And two days later, Google had a similar tool running, PersonFinder, that the State Department promoted on its own Web site and Twitter. PersonFinder grew out of missing-persons technology developed after Hurricane Katrina ravaged New Orleans in 2005.\n\nChristopher Csikszentmihalyi, director of the Center for Future Civic Media at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, advocated online for consolidating all such tools into the Google version so the information wouldn\'t be stuck in competing projects.\n\nHe considers PersonFinder, which can be embedded in any Web site and as of Tuesday had more than 32,000 records, a triumph because it "greatly increases the chances that Haitians in Haiti and abroad will be able to find each other."\n\nSchwartz agreed and folded his database into PersonFinder, which he thinks will become "THE application for missing people for this disaster and all disasters in the future."\n\nThe site has received several hundred thousand visits, said Google spokeswoman Elaine Filadelfo. She had no data on how many people had found loved ones using the tool.\n\nAnother volunteer project forged in the quake\'s aftermath is a cell phone text-messaging system that has helped the U.N., Red Cross and other relief groups dispatch rescuers, food and water. Haitians needing help can send free text messages from phones on the nation\'s Digicel and Comcel networks to the number 4636.\n\n"At least 20 people so far have been able to use this program to tell their families in the U.S. that they\'re OK," said Katie Stanton, a former Google employee working in the State Department\'s Office of Innovation.\n\nThe text messages are translated, categorized and "geotagged" by volunteers including Haitian-American members of the New York City-based Service Employees International Union. The service is being promoted on Haitian radio stations and the service has handled more than 1,000 messages since it began Saturday, said Josh Nesbit, a co-creator. He put together a similar system for hospitals in Malawi, Africa, while at Stanford University.\n\nChief executive Eric Rasmussen of InSTEDD, a small humanitarian nonprofit that helped develop it, said by phone from the tarmac of Haiti\'s airport Tuesday that U.N. search-and-rescue dispatchers were at that moment mobilizing to locate a woman eight months pregnant in distress with an infection who had sent an SOS message using the system.\n\nIn another collaborative effort, the OpenStreetMap "crisis mapping" project, volunteers layer up-to-the-minute data (such as the location of new field hospitals and downed bridges) onto post-quake satellite imagery that companies including GeoEye and DigitalGlobe have made freely available. The digital cartography -- informed by everything from Twitter feeds to eyewitness reports -- has helped aid workers speed food, water and medicine to where it\'s needed most.\n\nOne Colombian rescue team leader uploaded the maps to his crew\'s portable GPS units before the team arrived on the scene last week, developers said. Another volunteer, Talbot Brooks of Delta State University in Cleveland, Miss., converts the maps into letter-sized documents that aid workers have been printing out before traveling to the quake zone.\n\n"We have already been using their data in our initial post-disaster needs assessment," said Stuart Gill of the World Bank.\n\nInternet social networks have helped volunteers organize intense work sessions.\n\nCrisisCamp drew some 400 people in six cities including Washington, London and Mountain View, Calif., over the weekend to meet-ups where they devised, built and helped refine tools. Among them: a basic Creole-English dictionary for the iPhone that was delivered to Apple on Monday night for its approval.\n\n"There was no break for lunch and people barely used the bathroom," said Clay Johnson of the Sunlight Foundation, the government transparency-promoting tech nonprofit that hosted the 130 participants in the Washington session. U.N., State Department and World Bank representatives attended.\n\nJohnson also is the coordinator for "We Have, We Need," a project that was hatched in the CrisisCamp session and is about to be launched. It seeks to pair private-sector offers with needs identified by aid workers. For example, a Haitian Internet provider needs networking engineers to restore connectivity.

Two faculty members who were acting as advisors to the group, Patrick Hartwick and Richard Bruno, are also missing as well as two other professors from the university who happened to be vacationing in Haiti at the time of the earthquake.\n\nStudents on campus began a candlelight vigil Saturday night, lighting luminaries outside the student center for those students and faculty still missing in Haiti. The university plans to continue this tradition every night "going forward."

"This isn\'t any kind of success story because you know we\'re missing two professors and four other students."\n\nAnother student, Tom Schloemer, said he felt guilty that he was rescued and others are still missing.\n\n"We still feel a little bad about leaving but we had to get off that mountain," said Schloemer.

The Plantain Garden fault shows as a straight, sharp cut in the mountains. Elevations in this computer-generated image are exaggerated by a factor of two.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey says the fault probably caused a major earthquake in Jamaica in 1907, and written descriptions suggest it caused powerful quakes in 1860, 1770, 1761, 1751, 1684, 1673, and 1618.\n\nTension Built Underground\n\nBut in recent decades the two sides of the fault line had been locked in place as they ground against each other and stresses built up in the ground.\n\n"This fault was locked in a way that it didn\'t produce a lot of small quakes," said Art Lerner-Lam of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University in Palisades, N.Y.\n\nWithout those small quakes as a reminder of the greater threat, people in the area put up cheap buildings, made from cinderblock and tin.\n\nU.S. scientists say they understand: Haiti was so poor it could barely deal with day-to-day concerns, much less the long-term threat of an earthquake.\n\nSeismologists emphasize that they are still very far from predicting earthquakes, since the ground beneath our feet is by nature chaotic. But last week\'s earthquake in Haiti had a reported magnitude of 7.0, so the warning by Mann, Calais and their colleagues of a 7.2 quake was not far off.\n\nEarthquake in Haiti: The View from Above\n\nHow to assess the damage? Many of the numbers so far are estimates from the Haitian government, or what is left of it. A California-based firm, EQECAT, which provides damage estimates for insurance companies, plugged the Haitian earthquake into a computer model.\n\n"In light of the considerable humanitarian aid needed for recovery, in addition to the cost of reconstruction, EQECAT\'s updated estimate of economic damage is in the low-single-digit billions of dollars," the firm said.\n\nBy U.S. standards, that\'s cheap. The earthquake in Northridge, Calif., on Jan. 17, 1994, did an estimated $20 billion in damage -- in 1994 dollars. It would be closer to $29 billion when inflation is factored in.\n\nBut the difference is in the death toll. Haitian officials say more than 200,000 people have died, compared to 72 after Northridge.\n\nSince Haiti has enough trouble burying its dead, to say nothing of counting them, we may never know the final numbers.', 'title': 'Haiti Earthquake: Fault Line Visible From Space Shuttle', 'url': 'https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/HaitiEarthquake/haiti-earthquake-fault-line-visible-space-shuttle/story?id=9593349', 'keywords': ['visible', 'shuttle', 'fault', 'university', 'far', 'quakes', 'space', 'earthquake', 'say', 'haitian', 'caused', 'haiti', 'line', 'damage'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': "It is not as if the earthquake in Haiti was a surprise to the world's seismologists.\nU.S. scientists say they understand: Haiti was so poor it could barely deal with day-to-day concerns, much less the long-term threat of an earthquake.\nEarthquake in Haiti: The View from AboveHow to assess the damage?\nA California-based firm, EQECAT, which provides damage estimates for insurance companies, plugged the Haitian earthquake into a computer model.\nSince Haiti has enough trouble burying its dead, to say nothing of counting them, we may never know the final numbers.", 'date': None}, {'text': 'Please enable cookies on your web browser in order to continue.\n\nThe new European data protection law requires us to inform you of the following before you use our website:\n\nWe use cookies and other technologies to customize your experience, perform analytics and deliver personalized advertising on our sites, apps and newsletters and across the Internet based on your interests.

The numbers are still only more-or-less informed guesses, but their magnitude is grim: perhaps 200,000 killed, 250,000 more injured and some 3m in desperate need of help. The generosity of the world's response has also been profound. Barack Obama led the way, dispatching 16,000 American troops and marines, but others, from Europe to Brazil, Cuba, China and Israel, responded too. Immediate promises of aid added up to around nearly $1 billion.\n\nThe urgent task is to connect this supply of help with the demand. That is proving extraordinarily hard (see article). Seven days after the earthquake, the United Nations had got food to only 200,000 people. Lessons from other disasters are not always relevant to Haiti. The Asian tsunami, for example, struck a ribbon of remote, mainly rural, areas. The governments of the affected nations could lead the relief effort. But Haiti's institutions were weak even before the disaster. Because the quake devastated the capital, both the government and the UN, which has been trying to build a state in Haiti since 2004, were decapitated, losing buildings and essential staff. So did many NGOs. The president, René Préval, and his cabinet have been reduced to meeting in a police station.\n\nInto that vacuum stepped the United States. Inevitably the dispatch of marines, Black Hawks and an aircraft-carrier looked to some like an invasion (after all, they have been there before). A brief caricature of great-power prickliness ensued as the Americans took charge of the airport and seemed to some others to give priority to their own flights. But by mid-week the airport was receiving three times as many flights as it did before the earthquake. The American forces are well-equipped for the vital task of setting up a supply chain for aid. That is what they are doing under a sensible division of labour eventually hammered out (the Brazilian-led UN peacekeeping force remains in charge of security, and the UN will co-ordinate the aid effort). Certainly most ordinary Haitians seemed pleased to see the Americans.\n\nThey are just desperate for water, food, fuel, medicines and shelter. Contrary to some reports, there were only isolated cases of looting and fighting. But delay and disarray has cost many lives. The longer it lasts, the more likely that desperation turns to violence. The UN called for more peacekeepers. Brazil offered 800; it may take weeks to muster the rest. If ever a situation cried out for the UN to have a standing army at its disposal, as The Economist has urged, this is it.\n\nAmid such chaos, it might seem premature to think about a long-term strategy for rebuilding Haiti. Actually, it is vital. Already Haitians' resilient response to disaster is creating new facts on unstable ground: the spontaneous refugee camps around the capital will be hard to shift. Even before the earthquake Haiti was poor, environmentally degraded and aid-dependent and had few basic services. This means that “building back better” must be more than just a slogan. It also means that time is short before the world's generosity turns to cynicism.\n\nFortunately there is a blueprint, drawn up by Haiti's government and presented to donors last year. It calls for investment to be targeted on infrastructure, basic services and combating soil erosion to make farmers more productive and the country less vulnerable to hurricanes. The pressing question is who should do it and how. Haiti's government is in no position to take charge, yet the country needs a strong government to put it to rights. Paul Collier, a development economist who worked on the plan, reckons that the answer is to set up a temporary development authority with wide powers to act.\n\nGiven the local vacuum of power, this is the best idea around. The authority should be set up under the auspices of the UN or of an ad hoc group (the United States, Canada, the European Union and Brazil, for example). It should be led by a suitable outsider (Bill Clinton, who is the UN's special envoy for Haiti, would be ideal, perhaps to be followed by Brazil's Lula after he steps down as president in a year's time) and a prominent Haitian, such as the prime minister. To provide services, it should work with aid groups.\n\nSome will object that this would undermine a democratically elected government. But there is not much left to undermine. Done well, it could create a state in Haiti able to do more than preside over chaos and corruption.

But the bad news is that many of the buildings housing their operations have been crushed by the temblor, and they were not immediately able to fly in more aid, because Haiti\'s international airport in the capital, Port-au-Prince was closed.\n\n"The level of care we can provide is severely limited," says Toronto-based Paul McPhun, part of Medecins sans Frontieres\' (MSF) global emergency management team for Haiti. "Already things are getting overwhelmed.

I decide to stop by the site of the former Citibank, just to see if anyone there now knows what happened to the woman who was directing her own rescue the night after the quake. I’m hoping for good news.\n\nThe site looks pretty much like it did on Wednesday, only there are international rescue workers here now. A young woman approaches me.\n\nThere is someone trapped in a house nearby, she says. She’s young, earnest, and pleads with me to bring help. She’s calm, level-headed, and I believe her. I approach the rescue squad, which is from Mexico, and one of the men says he will come with me to check it out.\n\nWe drive down Delmas 30, turn left on rue Charlemagne, and go halfway down the block to where a crowd of people has gathered. We run down the alley to a house in the back, climb up the rubble onto the roof of another building, and now we are directly in front of the collapsed home.\n\nThere are two Brazilian television crews here, and a bunch of curious Haitians. The Brazilians say they captured the sound of a girl’s voice on their microphone. The Mexican rescue worker asks everyone to be quiet.\n\nOne of the Haitians taps on a wall of the house. Someone inside taps back.\n\nI’m breathless. It’s Sunday night, five days after the quake, and there’s someone alive inside and I’m about, I hope, to witness this survivor's rescue. My legs are weak.\n\nThe Mexican man starts to remove large chunks of rubble from the hole that seems to have the most immediate access. Meanwhile, I send the girl who found me back to the Citibank site with my driver to see if she can get more Mexican rescuers to help.\n\nShe returns 10 minutes later empty-handed. But the Brazilians bring back a rescue team that flew in from Florida's Miami-Dade County two days after the quake, and suddenly things get very serious.\n\nThey have two dogs with them, and although we all insist that this isn’t a wild-goose chase, they basically order the Mexican to stand down. It’s too dangerous, they tell him, to continue doing what he’s doing without bracing another section of the house. They send in their dogs to do the initial search.\n\nThe dog enters the site where part of the third-floor bedroom is visible. A Haitian, Max, who has been standing with us on the roof, says that is his bed. He was lying on it with his wife when the earthquake started. There is a drawer from a chest of drawers visible, one on the top of the bed, a baby crib, school notebooks, a water pump.\n\nI feel Max’s impatience, watching the dogs, holding my breath.\n\nThe dog will determine for the rescue team whether the tap – and the voice that we heard – are legitimate. It seems like a waste of valuable time but I know these guys are professional, that their safety is first, and so along with everyone else, I just wait.\n\nThere are about a dozen guys wearing the blue T-shirts that say Miami-Dade Urban Search and Rescue Team. They’ve been here since Thursday, rescued 15 people so far. Just before getting to this site, one of them tells me they just rescued a 3-year-old. A few of them speak Creole. Two of them look vaguely familiar, I can't quite place the faces.\n\nThe first dog comes back and the second dog goes down. The Mexican is upset, tries to talk to the Americans, but they aren’t interested.\n\nI’m biting my tongue. I know they have protocol, but I feel the same angst I felt yesterday when I had the 2-month old on my lap and I was afraid that every minute I spent in the car trying to get her to the hospital was a minute too long.\n\nWhat is the dog doing? She appears to be anxious, running in and out of openings, pawing as if she wants to go right through the cement wall. I think that’s what the Mexican wants to do, too. And the rest of us, for that matter.\n\nFinally, the dog barks. That’s it. Confirmation.\n\nThe guys from Miami swing into action. Some are up high on a another roof, some are down low, some are in the back of the house. They each seem to have a job. The dog handlers seem pleased – turns out it’s Vegas’s first rescue, and her handler, Frank Garcia, is delighted with her performance.\n\nThe dogs are taught to bark when they come upon a live body that’s trapped. Without that bark, the team won’t go in. Too many people, explains another dog handler, Gregory Strickland, desperate to find loved ones, swear that they hear family members days later just because they don’t want to give up hope. His dog, Indy, has been doing this for 19 months.\n\nWhen I hear another crew member call the Creole speaker “Doctor,” I realize that the first face I can’t place is Rudy Moise, a well-known Haitian-American doctor and activist in Miami, a man I’ve met many times before. The other man is Florida Congressman Kendrick Meek. He’d been so moved by what the rescue team was doing that he jumped on a plane in order to witness what was going on and bring whatever resources he could.\n\nThe rescue team works slowly. People on the roof tell us there are three people trapped: a 14-year-old girl, Frangina; 7-year-old Nazer, and 5-year-old Kevin. They’re not related. They were all living in the house, and watching TV at the time of the quake.\n\nNazer’s mother is on the street outside the house with 3-year-old Ricky, who she was able to grab when the house fell. Nazer ran back inside.\n\nKevin’s parents are in the States.\n\nThe rescue team works slowly, trying various strategies to get close to where they think the three are trapped. Finally, they are close enough to get a camera in and see movements from a girl’s hand.\n\nHearing that breathes a new life into the crowd. This is not a voyeur’s trip. It’s the real thing, as close as I have ever gotten, or want to get, to a life-or-death rescue. The scene is surreal. They now have the lights focused on the house, the generator is powering the tools, and the energize crowd suddenly erupts with a cheer.\n\nShortly before 10:00 p.m., they are ready to go in. Nearly six hours have passed since I arrived, and I barely notice.\n\nNazer, the 7-year old, comes out first. It’s dramatic. They have him on an improvised stretcher. I stay out of the way as a whole fleet of people attend to him. When I finally get a look, I can see he’s bone thin, skeletal like. But smiling. He points to his tooth, says he cracked it, as though that was the worst thing that happened. He even smiles.\n\nBut not so with Frangina, the teenager. She learns, as she’s pulled out, that little Kevin has died. She’s wailing, saying over and over again that she couldn’t see him.\n\nShe must have been trapped in such a way that he was behind her and that she was only talking to Nazer all along, not Kevin, too. Her pain pierces me. She’s so distraught that it’s hard to feel complete joy at her release.\n\nOut of respect for Kevin and his family, the rescue team doesn’t extract his body while the crowd is on the roof. We wait for the rescuers to take Frangina and Nazer to the vehicles below before we go down ourselves. Frangina has grown quiet.\n\nIn contrast Nazer smiles, gives a thumbs up, and the vehicles drive away.\n\n---- For all stories, blogs, and updates on Haiti after the earthquake, go to The Monitor's Haiti page.", 'title': 'Haiti earthquake diary: Eyewitness to a Miami-Dade team rescue', 'url': 'https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Haiti-Earthquake-Diary/2010/0124/Haiti-earthquake-diary-Eyewitness-to-a-Miami-Dade-team-rescue', 'keywords': ['trapped', 'site', 'shes', 'diary', 'mexican', 'nazer', 'team', 'rescue', 'miamidade', 'earthquake', 'haiti', 'house', 'eyewitness', 'roof', 'dog'], 'tags': {'Florida Congressman Kendrick Meek', 'Florida', 'Gregory Strickland', 'Rudy Moise', 'Haiti', 'Miami', 'Mexico', 'Frank Garcia', 'Miami-Dade County', 'Citibank'}, 'summary': "But the Brazilians bring back a rescue team that flew in from Florida's Miami-Dade County two days after the quake, and suddenly things get very serious.\nThe dog will determine for the rescue team whether the tap – and the voice that we heard – are legitimate.\nThere are about a dozen guys wearing the blue T-shirts that say Miami-Dade Urban Search and Rescue Team.\nThe rescue team works slowly, trying various strategies to get close to where they think the three are trapped.\nOut of respect for Kevin and his family, the rescue team doesn’t extract his body while the crowd is on the roof.", 'date': 1264351560}, {'text': 'The United States has launched a major civilian and military response to the massive earthquake in Haiti, which has flattened buildings in much of the capital, and left a devastating toll of death and destruction.

Our priority is building transitional and permanent housing but also developing local community structures around them.”\n\nThere are many lessons to be drawn – of both successes and failures – from the recovery effort after the last international catastrophe on this scale.\n\nIt was on Boxing Day 2004 that a devastating tsunami pummelled Asian coastal communities after a huge undersea earthquake. The Banda Aceh region on the Indonesian island of Sumatra bore the brunt of the ferocious waters, suffering at least 160,000 of the estimated 250,000 million fatalities. Perhaps half a million were left homeless.\n\nThere, as in Haiti, US naval forces played a key role in the immediate relief operation as an unprecedented influx of foreign aid flooded in. And Mr Clinton was recruited, with Mr Bush’s father, to head up a similar reconstruction mission.\n\nInitial progress was mixed, but after five years an estimated 130,000 new homes have been built, along with schools, highways and other infrastructure projects such as an impressive port. Yet mistakes were also made - so many new boats were supplied that the waters around the coast have suffered from overfishing.\n\nBy some accounts, resources were also wasted and panic unleashed by an overstatement of the risk of diseases such as cholera the initial relief mission. Some 160,000 locals were targetted in an cholera immunisation campaign although few cases of the disease ever occurred.\n\nMr Sinclair emphasises the need to identify local partners and avoid the dangers of overdependence on foreign aid. “It may seem surprising to outsiders but Haitians are a resilient people and Haitian pride is an important factor.\n\n“You can’t just have the Americans moving in to run the show s that will reek of colonialism and end with resentment and schisms,”\n\nHe said would draw same lessons as Katrina and their work in Sri Lanka, another country badly hit by the 2004 tsunami. “You can’t just airdrop in architects, you have to work with the local community and give them a voice.

UNICEF has even reported children taken from hospitals.\n\nDuring such chaotic times with many international groups, planes, supplies moving in and out of the airport and borders, there is a greater opportunity for human trafficking. Security in and around Haiti is relaxed to move goods and aid in as fast as possible but that also allows trafficking to occur more easily.\n\nThere are a lot of homeless children and separated families that are at risk. Human trafficking usually increases after disasters, just like after the Tsunami in Asia in 2004. Organizations are registering people, children and others, who are separated, homeless, in hospitals, and are trying to reunite families.\n\nAnd even though many well-intentioned people around the world would like to help and adopt Haiti children at this time, organizations (Save the Children and World Vision) are calling for a halt to adoptions arranged after the earthquake. It is too difficult to discern at this time who is truly interested in adoption and who are traffickers. Also, there are many orphanages in Haiti that are barely regulated and so some are working directly with human traffickers.\n\nHuman Rights lawyer, Beth Klein, states that some legitimate US adoptions, which were cleared before the earthquake, are currently blocked. Because of all the confusion, the Joint Council of International Child Services has been deployed to Haiti to create standards and develop a plan to hopefully move proper adoptions forward.\n\nBefore the earthquake, more than 300,000 children were already in forced labor in Haiti. Human trafficking was already an issue. Now, it will only get worse.\n\nHaiti's population currently consists of poor youth-45% of the population is under 15 years of age. With new international aid and emerging reconstruction plans, developing a long-term economic plan is also an important ingredient. Stable incomes and economic options for communities reduce the risk of people falling into human trafficking.

Caribbean beaches, a private peninsula described as "breath-taking" by the US tourism company Royal Caribbean International (RCI), which leases the area.\n\nBut this isn\'t your typical holiday paradise, this is the resort of Labadee and it lies in northern Haiti, a country struggling to get back on its feet after last week\'s devastating earthquake. Large parts of the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince were destroyed and some 200,000 people are thought to have lost their lives. But at the Labadee resort (near Cap-Haïtien on the map at left), it\'s business as usual.\n\nAs recently as Wednesday afternoon, Haiti was rattled by a strong magnitude 6.1 aftershock. But the cruise lines nevertheless decided not to reschedule their cruises. "We are in constant contact with the authorities," Tom Fecke, the head of RCI in Germany, told SPIEGEL ONLINE. "If there is any risk associated with docking our ships, we will reconsider."\n\nThe northern coast has thus far been spared by the temblors. It has also long been spared contact with Haiti\'s grinding poverty. High fences and armed security guards ensure the holiday makers can snorkel and sunbathe undisturbed.\n\nFecke says the company stands by its decision to continue operations in Labadee despite the natural disaster. "If we pulled out of Haiti, we would be far less help to the country." The firm has leased the secluded peninsula for 30 years and has created 500 jobs over that time. RCI pays a levy of $6 for every tourist who disembarks on Labadee.\n\nMore than 900,000 holiday-makers visit Haiti every year and two thirds of them arrive by cruise ship. Every week, several RCI ocean liners dock at Labadee. On Monday the Navigator of the Seas anchored there, followed, on Tuesday, by the Liberty of the Seas. If everything goes as planned, the Celebrity Solstice will arrive at the harbor on Friday. According to CEO Richard Fain, RCI has transported half a million tourists to the destination each year -- and that figure is rising.\n\nA Standing Ovation\n\nEven former US President Bill Clinton, the UN\'s special envoy for Haiti, visited the peninsula in October 2009. And local support for tourism is strong: Even government officials have asked RCI not to abandon the region, Fecke says. Late last week, Leslie Voltaire, an emissary of the Haitian government to the UN, praised the "positive economic benefits" of cruise ships.\n\nThose economic benefits become particularly clear when cruise companies make direct donations to the Haitian aid effort. The global head of RCI, Adam Goldstein, pledged $1 million (\x80707,000) for the stricken country. Passengers aboard the luxury liner Independence of the Sea responded to news of the donation with a standing ovation, Goldstein proudly informed the TV station, Fox Business Network. Travelers aboard the cruise ship were also willing to dig deep into their pockets to support the cause, Germany\'s Managing Director Fecke said, adding, "all the revenue that we make on board during the stay in Haiti will be donated."\n\nRCI says its five luxury liners bring not only tourists from Florida to Labadee, but also much-needed supplies for victims of the quake. In collaboration with the aid agency Food For The Poor, its liners transport basics including rice and beans, water and bandages to Port-au-Prince. "We have created a bridge between Miami and Haiti," said Fecke.\n\n"A Win-Win Situation"\n\nBut not everyone approves of the cruise line\'s policy. Many comments on Internet forums call into question the decision to carry on with "business as usual" during a humanitarian catastrophe, arguing it smacks of dishonesty, cynicism and insensitivity.\n\nAnd some cruise passengers are also dismayed by the idea of holidays in a disaster zone. One blog by a RCI passenger argued that it was inconceivable to lie on the beach in the sun, play in the water or sip a cocktail, while "tens of thousands of dead are piled in the streets and survivors fight for food and water."\n\nNobody wants to carry their loved ones to the grave, under the watchful eye of a gaggle of holiday makers, argued one blogger, identified as Kengai, on the "Cruise Critic" Web site. But he said that passengers staying aboard their cruise ship in Haiti was even worse: \'Then I would feel even more helpless, so close and yet not able to help ... RCI should continue traveling to Haiti -- but not right now."\n\nBut bookings do not indicate a high level of customer concern. Despite a few cancellations, "there is no question of a wave of cancellations among German passengers," said Fecke.\n\nThe cruise-portal "Cruise Critic" conducted an online survey on the subject. Of 4,700 English-speaking participants, 67 percent said that stops in the port of Labadee should continue and should deliver relief supplies. A "Cruise Critic" user named Liberty Lover wrote on the blog that he had witnessed fleet captains distributing food to the needy. "It\'s a win-win situation for everyone involved," he wrote.\n\n\'We Are Committed to Help\'\n\nShould all major travel companies working in troubled regions assist humanitarian missions to justify their continued business operations? Fecke hesitates. "Haiti is part of our company, we are obliged to help," he says. Many attractive tourist destinations lie in areas beset by poverty. And it is important to support these parts of the world, he said. "Therefore, tourism businesses should always involve local people in their work."\n\nThomas Wilde is the head of the PR agency Wilde and Partners, which represents RCI in Germany. Would the decision to keep its cruise ships arriving in Haiti boost the company\'s reputation? "No one in our company is running around with dollar signs in their eyes, nor are they advocating for more humanitarian campaigns from within the tourism industry," Wilde says, adding that RCI is trying to maintain a kind of normality on the ground, despite the difficult circumstances.\n\n"When tourists stay away, people lose their jobs.

Watch "AC360°," tonight at 10 ET.\n\n(CNN) -- We were just there to help.\n\nThat was the message Friday from Jim Allen, one of the 10 American missionaries arrested January 29 in Haiti on child kidnapping charges. Allen, along with seven others, was released this week without needing to post bail.\n\nTwo members of the group -- including the group\'s leader, Laura Silsby -- have remained in Haitian custody to answer questions about why they traveled to the country on an earlier trip.\n\nSilsby and Charisa Coulter were back in a Haitian courtroom Friday. Silsby said she hoped the legal process would be completed by the end of the day.\n\nAllen said he went to Haiti because he "knew that I had some skills that I could use." In an appearance on "Oprah," he said he has experience in the construction industry.\n\nAllen said he\'s not angry with Haitian authorities. "They were going through the legal process [and] ... I think they needed to," he said.\n\nThe 10 missionaries were charged with kidnapping and criminal association for trying to take 33 children out of Haiti after the magnitude-7.0 earthquake that devastated the impoverished country January 12.\n\nAllen said the group had been approached by a man at an orphanage who claimed to have a group of children with no parents or access to care. The man asked if "we could please help," he said.\n\nAllen claimed that the group intended to bring the children to a temporary orphanage set up at a hotel in the Dominican Republic. When his group returned to the United States, Allen said, another group of volunteers would have taken responsibility for providing care to the children.\n\nHis arrest by Haitian authorities, he said, was "quite a shock," but he always remained confident that "as soon as [our] story was told ... we\'d be coming home."\n\nBeing in jail was hard, he added, but the Haitian police "treated us as well as they could with what they had."\n\nThe missionaries slept on a concrete floor while in jail but "had a roof over our head" and a hot meal once a day, he said. When it rained, water would drip into his cell, but outside, "millions" of people in the street "were getting poured on," he said.\n\nA large number of Haitians "had it worse than I had it," he said.\n\nAllen said he had no indication that there is any truth to the charge that Silsby was hoping to profit from the mission by looking for children she could later place with families for large fees.\n\nThe missionaries were "legitimately interested" in helping the children, he claimed. They had "good intentions."\n\nAllen dismissed as "a complete fabrication" reports that eight members of the group signed a note saying they had been misled by Silsby.\n\nHe said he has "no ill feelings toward anybody"\n\nPhyllis Allison, Allen\'s mother, recently said that her son\'s captivity in Haiti had "been awful, but we just trusted in God" that he would return home.\n\nAllen, along with the seven other released missionaries, arrived at Miami International Airport late Wednesday night on a U.S. Air Force C-130 cargo plane from the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince.\n\nLawyer Gary Lissade, who represents Allen, has said the fact that the judge released the Americans on their own recognizance may indicate that the charges will be eventually dropped.\n\nAllen, who lives in Amarillo, Texas, told Oprah Winfrey he had a very "good night of sleep last night."', 'title': "Haiti missionary: We had 'good intentions'", 'url': 'http://edition.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/02/19/haiti.missionary/index.html', 'keywords': ['missionary', 'children', 'intentions', 'good', 'haitian', 'missionaries', 'group', 'haiti', 'claimed', 'allen', 'released', 'night', 'silsby'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Hear from Jim Allen, one of the missionaries detained in Haiti and later released.\nThat was the message Friday from Jim Allen, one of the 10 American missionaries arrested January 29 in Haiti on child kidnapping charges.\nAllen said he went to Haiti because he "knew that I had some skills that I could use."\nAllen claimed that the group intended to bring the children to a temporary orphanage set up at a hotel in the Dominican Republic.\nAllen, who lives in Amarillo, Texas, told Oprah Winfrey he had a very "good night of sleep last night."', 'date': None}, {'text': '(CNN) -- Thirty-three Haitians were released Thursday from immigration detention facilities in Florida, more than two months after they arrived in the United States lacking proper immigration papers in the aftermath of their country\'s devastating earthquake.\n\nThe 33 were among 65 Haitians detained since entering the country without visas after the January 12 earthquake.

While numbers remain only estimates, Haitian officials say that more than 100,000 people died in the disaster.\n\nFive-month-old Berlando puts a human face on both those staggering numbers and the orphan-adoption controversy. A resident of God’s Children for a week, Berlando was brought in by his grandmother, who could not care for him after both his parents were killed in the quake.\n\n"They found him lying on a bed with his father, the father had died but the baby survived,” says Pierre Alexis, administrative director of God’s Children. “If the grandmother says no one in that family can care for him, we feel the child is better off here.”\n\nAs wrenching as the stories of children left with no family after the earthquake may be, they are just a new twist on a recurring story here – one often made sadder by an element of neglect.\n\nMr. Alexis tells of the baby that passers-by found in an adjacent rubbish-filled gully. “She had been tossed in like another bag of garbage,” he says. He points to a different girl, immobile in a crib, whose mother tried to abort her by drinking a poison.\n\nNow Alexis and his staff sleep with the children out on the ground, the children too frightened after the earthquake to sleep inside. And he has hired new security to keep out the thieves that have tried since the quake to get at the orphanage’s meager food supplies.\n\nHaiti and US cut red tape for adoptions\n\nOne silver lining to an otherwise terrible disaster, Alexis says, is how the quake has expedited adoptions to the US. On Saturday 80 children left God’s Children headed for their new American families, Haitian and American red tape suddenly cut.\n\nMembers of Congress pressed the State Department to move for quick evacuation from Haiti of children who were already in the adoption pipeline. And last week 34 senators led by Rep. Robert Menendez (D) of New Jersey sent a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, seeking additional steps to ensure expedited adoptions from Haiti.\n\nThe letter called for a reinforced effort to “find and rescue” orphans in Haiti, for new “adoption centers” to care for orphans, and for facilitating adoptions in cases where documentation was destroyed by the earthquake.\n\nDangers to rushing adoptions\n\nBut some experts say rushing adoptions in a disaster aftermath is the wrong answer for displaced children. Thousands of Haitian children may have indeed been either orphaned or separated from families by the quake, says the New York-based Women’s Refugee Commission (WRC). But in-country protection services and reunification efforts should be emphasized first, the group says.\n\n“It’s tempting to want to airlift children out of Haiti, getting them out of harm’s way immediately,” says Michelle Brané, director of WRC’s detention and asylum program. “But it’s important to remember that in the current chaos, thousands of people, including parents and children, are still searching for their families. Removing children from countries too quickly after an emergency,” she adds, can “jeopardize family reunification efforts…and increase the risk that children will fall into the hands of traffickers and other ill-intentioned individuals.”\n\nMs. Brané says it’s a common practice of parents or caregivers in Haiti to send their children to orphanages for better care and security.\n\nThat appears to be true at the Center for Aid to the Disinherited, a combination orphanage, neighborhood school – and now homeless camp – also in the Delmas neighborhood. Run by a Haitian nun, the school has a bewildering mix of orphans, local children who live and learn at the school but have some family, and abandoned children whose status in unclear.\n\n“If I’m presented with an abandoned child, I don’t have it in me to turn him away,” says Sister Marie Judith Clerfond, the school’s director. “Some of them still have parents, but we don’t know where they are.”\n\nManaging the school’s 300 children – including 30 orphans – was a daily challenge for Sister Marie Judith before the quake, but now she seems overwhelmed.\n\nThe temblor brought down the roof over the dispensary, and the chapel was damaged. Earth slid out from under a dormitory building.\n\nAnd now she has more mouths to feed. World Vision donated some tarps for the homeless who have come into the yard, but no one has come forward with food donations, and the school is running low.\n\nBut Sister Marie Judith says she hasn’t considered adoption for her school’s orphans.\n\n“Our motto is to raise the children so they can make their own way in life,”she says, “and I think Haiti needs that, maybe even more so now.”', 'title': 'Haiti earthquake reignites debate over fast-tracking adoptions', 'url': 'https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2010/0125/Haiti-earthquake-reignites-debate-over-fast-tracking-adoptions', 'keywords': ['children', 'adoptions', 'parents', 'haitian', 'earthquake', 'quake', 'haiti', 'debate', 'orphans', 'adoption', 'family', 'school', 'fasttracking', 'gods', 'reignites'], 'tags': {'Sister Marie Judith Clerfond', 'World Vision', 'State Department', 'Refugee Commission', 'Port-au-Prince', 'New Jersey', 'Haiti', 'Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton', 'New York', 'Center for Aid', 'Michelle Brané', 'Sister Marie Judith', 'Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano', 'Pierre Alexis', 'US', 'Rep.

"Geologists should not be surprised by this earthquake."\n\nLin co-authored the study with geologist Uri ten Brink of the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nThe epicenter of Tuesday\'s quake was 10 miles southwest of Port-au-Price, the Haitian capital.

"It\'s mostly a low-rise kind of place.

The reason: The rupture slid to the east. While strain would build at both ends of the ruptured segment, another rupture farther to the west would occur in a sparsely populated, hard to reach portion of Haiti. To the east, however, the fault traces a path through the mountains separating Haiti from the Dominican Republic and into the more-heavily populated southwestern portion of Haiti\'s neighbor.\n\nAlready, teams of researchers are planning to visit the stricken area to take the full measure of the quake before erosion or rebuilding efforts erase key pieces of evidence.\n\n"A lot of the data we need to collect are pretty ephemeral," says Carol Prentice, a US Geological Survey researcher who is part of a relatively small group of scientists who have studied the area.\n\nAccurate measurements of ground movement -- seen in offset stream beds or displaced roads, for instance -- help establish the amount of strain released. Careful monitoring of the strongest aftershocks, which can die off fairly quickly after a quake, help establish how deep in the crust the quake\'s break-point was. Tracking the quake\'s aftermath over the long term will help researchers better understand the slow rebound that occurs along the fault after the initial snap.\n\nWhy Haiti\'s fault got less attention\n\nThe tragic event has struck a broad patch of the globe -- the Caribbean -- well known for earthquakes and volcanic activity. But while islands such as Puerto Rico, Jamaica, and the Antilles chains are fairly well studied, Haiti hasn\'t received the same attention, since working in a country that is no stranger to poverty and hardship can be downright unsafe.\n\nStill, scientists have pulled together an increasingly clear picture of the broad geophysical context in which Monday\'s event took place. Hispaniola sits squarely atop a boundary between two plates in Earth\'s crust: the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate. The Caribbean Plate is trying to slide past a particularly tough block of crust underlying the Bahamas. The two are grinding past each other, much like the motion along another plate boundary -- California\'s San Andreas Fault.\n\nTuesday\'s quake occurred along the Enriquilla-Plantain Garden Fault, an east-west crack in the Earth that also runs west through Jamaica and out to the Cayman Islands. But Hispaniola also is home to another major fault, which cuts across its northern interior and heads toward Cuba.\n\nThese two fault systems trace their origins to a broader interaction between the North American plate and the Caribbean Plate. The North American plate is plunging under the Caribbean plate north of Hispanola and Puerto Rico. But one portion of the North America plate dubbed the Bahamas Platform is too bouyant to make the plunge easily, reseachers say. The result: The giant collision is deforming Hispanola.\n\nOver millions of years, Hispaniola\'s northern fault, the Septentrional, has been the major pathway for building and releasing strain from the sideways motion of the two plates. But some researchers now argue that activity may be shifting; the Enriquilla-Plantain Garden Fault may slowly be taking over as the main strain-relief valve for the plate boundary, explains Uri ten Brink, a geophysicist with the US Geological Survey\'s office in Woods Hole, Mass.\n\nIn effect, the region has two parallel plate boundaries. "That\'s quite unusual," he says. Indeed, given the number of people who live on the island, as well as the number who visit, "this was really a wake-up call to me to try and understand this system."', 'title': 'The geology underlying the devastating Haiti earthquake', 'url': 'https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2010/0113/The-geology-underlying-the-devastating-Haiti-earthquake', 'keywords': ['scientists', 'strain', 'fault', 'plate', 'earthquake', 'underlying', 'devastating', 'north', 'haiti', 'quake', 'caribbean', 'segment', 'portion', 'geology', 'researchers'], 'tags': {'Cayman Islands', 'Cuba', 'San Andreas Fault', 'the Bahamas', 'California', 'Eric Calais', 'Haiti', 'Jamaica', 'Dominican Republic', 'Carol Prentice', 'US Geological Survey', 'Woods Hole', 'Puerto Rico', 'Hispaniola', 'Purdue University', 'Caribbean', 'North America'}, 'summary': "Hispaniola sits squarely atop a boundary between two plates in Earth's crust: the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate.\nThe Caribbean Plate is trying to slide past a particularly tough block of crust underlying the Bahamas.\nThese two fault systems trace their origins to a broader interaction between the North American plate and the Caribbean Plate.\nThe North American plate is plunging under the Caribbean plate north of Hispanola and Puerto Rico.\nBut one portion of the North America plate dubbed the Bahamas Platform is too bouyant to make the plunge easily, reseachers say.", 'date': 1263410940}, {'text': "Tequila Minsky, a photographer based in New York who was in Port-au-Prince, said that a wall at the front of the Hotel Oloffson had fallen, killing a passer-by.

Aristide\'s party Fanmi Lavalas is one of 15 that have been banned from contesting legislative elections to be held in February.\n\nIrenea Renuncio-Mateos said it remains to be seen whether Haitians welcome Aristide\'s return as their "savior," or whether they turn to the United States and the international community to pull the country from turmoil.\n\n"An important factor is that the U.N.-led mission in Haiti has been encountering problems on the ground in the past because people have been hostile to foreign presence on the ground," she said.\n\n"If Aristide makes it to Haiti, what is going to be the impact? Is it going to cause protests?"\n\nThe former leader has a long and tumultuous relationship with Haiti, one of the world\'s poorest countries. He became its first freely elected president in December 1990 before being ejected from office just one year later in a military coup.\n\nHe was returned to power in 1994 after a peace agreement brokered by then-President Bill Clinton, backed by U.S. troops to restore order. After another change of leadership in 1995, Aristide took office again in November 2000 in a vote blighted by an opposition boycott and claims of fraud.\n\nThe deep unrest led to looting and violence that eventually forced Aristide into exile in 2004. During his presidency, Aristide lost the support of the United States and angered France with his calls for reparations for huge sums of money paid to the country for its independence.\n\nPresident Rene Preval came to power for the second time in February 2006.

He said this was because Obama was "humanitarian,compassionate", as if those were character flaws, and added for good measure that no one should donate money to Haiti relief funds because "we\'ve already donated. It\'s called the US income tax."\n\nNice. That\'ll take some beating. Even Jonathan Ross, doubtless feeling demob happy and almost free of the BBC\'s taste police, would surely confine himself to low bodily functions rather than high politics. Limbaugh is in a class of his own, pumping out filth that you wouldn\'t even smell in Port-au-Prince. Normal people wouldn\'t think like that.\n\nAt least, I hope they wouldn\'t. But there is a more genteel version of these views bubbling under in otherwise respectable, middle-class circles. It\'s a sort of Limbaugh-lite attitude, and it runs that it\'s hardly worth contributing to relief-aid appeals because the international response to Haiti\'s plight is so hopeless. Overheard after church yesterday: "It\'s been nearly a week and they still haven\'t got their act together." And in the pub: "It\'s New Orleans all over again – they talk big and do nothing."\n\n"They," of course, are the Americans. And they are being misrepresented. Some 3,500 US soldiers have been deployed from 82nd Airborne Division, and an enormous naval flotilla, including 2,200 Marines and a floating hospital, is arriving.\n\nNor do most Britons appear to think it\'s hopeless. The latest figure I\'ve heard for funds raised here is £15 million, and a BA flight, among many others, has delivered 50 tons of relief supplies so far from Oxfam and Unicef into a ruined airport, with one serviceable runway and no equipment for unloading. The delays are down to a logistical nightmare. And aid workers speak of no means of distribution and severe security issues from armed looters.\n\nSo why these almost immediate claims that not enough is being done? Partly, and understandably, it must be down to frustration, as time passes and more people die in the rubble. In those circumstances, Haitians are entitled to be impatient. But given the scale of the task and the problems in the way, it\'s less excusable for the rest of us, in the comfort of our uncollapsed houses thousands of miles away, to be so critical.\n\nPart of the reason for our horror at the delays are the images that our 24/7 media can deliver from disaster zones. But the developed world is also subject to a kind of movie-mindset. We half-inhabit a fantasy world in which Bruce Willis will save everyone in his dirty vest. Or, more worryingly, in which bad stuff is blown away by computer-guided missiles on CNN. But the real world and its real crises aren\'t like that. And it doesn\'t get any more real than Haiti.\n\nThen there\'s our consumerist attitude. We\'re accustomed to getting what we pay for, or we want to know why. It\'s a form of instant gratification. We\'ve thrown money at Haiti, so why hasn\'t it got better? I\'m afraid this is a strain of a mental condition known as Celeb Aid, the give-us-your-money-now campaign that is so very often about making the givers feel tearfully good about themselves in rock stadia, while brightly coloured Band Aid lorries are left up to their axles in sand, their loads looted by soldiers.\n\nHaiti deserves better than that. And aid workers deserve our support in delivering it properly. Not just our financial support, too, though God knows that\'s important. They also need our moral support. I know some of them and, like most of our Armed Forces, they are a breed apart.\n\nAid workers are daily putting their lives on the line in some\n\nof the most dangerous and dispiriting places on earth. They do what they can against disease and violence, watching thousands die in the hope that the next one might be saved; and, as if it matters, they work for a pittance, barely able to afford the cost of living in Britain when they return home.\n\nThese are the extraordinary people our money puts into the field when something like the Haiti earthquake happens. There\'s precious little comfort for the people of Haiti. But so long as there is the odd shock-jock spewing political bile on the airwaves, we should take some comfort that there is an entirely different sort of person serving a common humanity and put there with our money.

The government, awakened to the nation\'s construction follies, says it plans to crack down to ensure proper materials and techniques.\n\n\'We have to change\'\n\n"The government has no administrative control on building projects here (i.e. no building code to follow or building permits to take out), so when the Haitians and the outside world ask why did this disaster happen, what can anybody say?"A Canadian structural engineer entered this web post about his trip to Haiti after the earthquake.\n\nEngineers agree there are no excuses for the shoddy building that took place in Haiti.\n\n"We\'re in the state we\'re in because of one thing, because of poor construction practices," said Gay, who heads GDG Concrete and Construction. "We have to change. I\'ve been saying it for more than 10 years."\n\nToo many people suffered in the earthquake. If nothing else, Gay said he hopes fear will now serve as a guiding factor.\n\nGay\'s firm built the U.S. Embassy here, as well as telecommunications firm Digicel\'s glass tower and other structures that withstood the earthquake.\n\nBut without government regulation, enforced building codes and mandatory inspections, much of the rest of Haiti built as it pleased: cheaply.\n\nGay said concrete and cement companies used sand containing calcium carbonate, a "recipe for disaster," or diluted the strength of the cement with too much water, a cost-saving measure.\n\nSteel rebar was smooth, not marked with ridges as it is in the United States, which helps lock concrete in place. Only four bars of steel were used for every column, not eight as in America,\n\nHaitians did the minimum to raise a building, said Georgia Tech engineering professor Reginald DesRoches. Forget about withstanding a magnitude-7.0 earthquake.\n\nDesRoches, who has been making periodic trips to Haiti to help assess damage, said complicating Haiti\'s rebuilding is that structures have to be both earthquake- and hurricane-resistant. The former requires heavy, solid construction; the latter requires reinforcement and malleability.\n\n"A small difference in technique can make a huge difference, DesRoches said. But ultimately "it\'s about changing the whole culture of building."\n\nGay agreed.\n\nThankfully, he said, there isn\'t anyone left in Haiti who doesn\'t feel accountable.\n\n"The problem is that there was never any incentive to do it properly. The government has to do its job."\n\nFor the first time, the government intends to inspect new construction. It is requiring permits of those who want to repair damaged houses that have been marked as salvageable by the Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Communications. Inspectors have even stopped some questionable reconstruction projects.\n\nIt is also working with foreign experts to train Haitian engineers and masons; to make sure the nation has the skill set to build wisely.\n\nThe Department of Public Works partnered with well-known American structural engineer Kit Miyamoto to train engineers. Already, 500 have been trained, according to Leslie Voltaire, a member of the government\'s reconstruction committee.\n\nMiyamoto said the biggest challenge has been the sheer number of damaged buildings. So far, he said, about 70,000 have been assessed.\n\n"We need to come up with a unique strategic idea to deal with hundreds of thousands of structures to be repaired and reconstructed," he said. "It may take some time but they will get there."\n\nThe sound of hammers and saws\n\nConstruction issues and messy post-earthquake land disputes could slow the rebuilding effort. But with the urgent need for sound housing, some aid agencies have begun to construct transitional homes for thousands of Haitians facing a potentially violent rainy season without a roof over their heads.\n\nSome already have permanent materials; others can later be reinforced. Plans call for thousands of these tiny homes to dot the landscape. They go up quickly and relatively cheaply, and are not subject to complex building codes and inspections.\n\nThe noise of hammers and saws can be heard outside Port-au-Prince, in places like Cabaret and in Leogane, where land was available to build.\n\nJoseph Sanon oversees 45 carpenters for Habitat for Humanity. They are constructing plywood and corrugated tin shelters near Cabaret, on empty fields lined by watermelon crops and crimson hibiscus.\n\nThe Habitat houses consist of nine wooden posts rooted in buckets of concrete that can be removed later if necessary. The heavy-duty tarps that wrap around the posts can one day be replaced by more permanent materials, including concrete.\n\nIn the near future, Habitat is planning to build 1,000 such homes near Cabaret and another 1,000 in hard-hit Leogane to the west, said Habitat\'s Ken Meinert.\n\nFor Blanc Voltaire, the small one-room house is a gift from God, the only bright spot in the four months since the quake.\n\nHe proudly showed it off. It was clean. Orderly. A carved wooden china cabinet was filled with ceramic cups and dishes. The bed was dressed in crisp white linens. It was a far cry from the forlorn tin shack across the yard. That\'s where he used to sleep with his wife and four children. He put his hand to his calf to show how high the water rose when it rained.\n\nVoltaire said he is thankful for a proper roof over his children\'s heads. He knows he is among the lucky ones.\n\n"The demand is so high here," Habitat\'s Sanon said. "There is someone asking for a house every minute."\n\nIn Leogane, an American missionary group helped put up neat rows of pre-fabricated compressed wood huts. In each was a dining table, chairs, a bed -- a semblance of normalcy for those left with nothing.\n\nAbove the door in every house was a wooden placard that said, in Creole: "Bondye Beni Lakay Nou."
