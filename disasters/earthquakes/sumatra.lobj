[{'text': 'Asia quake death toll tops 13,000\n\n\n\n\n\nCHENNAI, India (CNN) -- As dawn broke Monday across the Bay of Bengal, countries struck by tsunamis in the wake of the most powerful earthquake the planet has seen in 40 years focused on relief and rescue efforts, and said the death toll from the giant waves -- already more than 13,000 -- is expected to rise further.\n\nThe tsunamis also left thousands injured, thousands missing and hundreds of thousands homeless in Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka and Thailand.\n\nSome of the tsunamis reached as far as 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) from the epicenter of the 9.0 magnitude quake, which was located about 160 kilometers (100 miles) off the coast of Indonesia\'s Sumatra Island at a depth of about 10 kilometers (6.2 miles).\n\nThe quake struck about 7 a.m. Sunday (midnight GMT Saturday), according to the U.S. Geological Survey\'s National Earthquake Center.\n\nIt is the fourth-largest earthquake since such measurements began in 1899, according to the NEIC, tying with a 1952 quake in Kamchatka, Russia.\n\nMore than 4,500 people have been reported dead in Sri Lanka. Most of them, authorities said, were in the eastern district of Batticaloa. Thousands were missing and more than a half million displaced.\n\nIn southern Sri Lanka, 200 prisoners escaped when the waves swept away a high-security prison in Matara.\n\nWitnesses in the eastern Sri Lankan port city Trincomalee reported 14 meter (40-foot) waves hitting inland as far as a kilometer (0.6 miles).\n\nThe Sri Lankan government declared a state of emergency, and, along with the government of the Maldives, has requested international assistance, the United Nations\' Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported.\n\nThe United Nations has warned of epidemics within days unless health systems in the affected areas can cope.\n\n"This may be the worst natural disaster in recent history because it is affecting so many heavily populated coastal areas ... so many vulnerable communities," the U.N.\'s Emergency Relief Coordinator Jan Egeland told CNN.

India sent six warships, carrying supplies, along with helicopters.\n\nPriorities including identifying the hardest-hit areas and air-dropping supplies, along with shepherding stranded people to safer areas.\n\nSri Lankan authorities imposed a curfew overnight, and many residents remained concerned about the possibility of additional tsunamis.\n\nThe country has been in the throes of a civil war, and land mines uprooted by the waves were hampering relief efforts.\n\nSome tourists, meanwhile, had been evacuated from the hard-hit eastern coasts to the capital, Colombo, on the west coast and unaffected.\n\nAt first light, many Sri Lankans ventured out to scour the debris for belongings or to search for information on missing family members.\n\nAlthough India was giving aid to Sri Lanka, that country also was reeling from the aftermath of the quake and tsunamis. India\'s official government news agency, Press Trust of India, said at least 4,000 Indians were killed, and more bodies were being recovered.\n\nA resident of Chennai (formerly Madras) in Tamil Nadu district -- India\'s hardest-hit area -- said he saw several people being swept out to sea.\n\nAlong India\'s southeastern coast, several villages appeared to have been swept away, and thousands of fishermen -- including 2,000 from the Chennai area alone -- who were at sea when the waves thundered ashore have not returned. (Full story)\n\nAlong the coast, brick foundations were all that remained of village homes. In Tamil Nadu state, 1,725 people have been confirmed dead, and officials feared many more died on the remote Andaman and Nicobar islands, where dozens of aftershocks were centered, but communication with the mainland was cut off.\n\nEfforts to provide survivors with food and shelter were hampered by the overwhelming magnitude of the damage.\n\nThai authorities said more than 400 people are dead, and hundreds are missing.\n\nOne witness said Phuket\'s famed Laguna Beach resort area is "completely gone." The area provided 40 percent of Thailand\'s $10 billion annual income from tourism.\n\nAmong the missing were scuba divers who had been exploring the Emerald Cave off Phuket\'s coast.\n\nPhuket\'s airport -- which closed when its runways flooded -- reopened, but most roads in the area remained closed, as officials tried to assess the damage.\n\nThai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra arrived in Phuket and declared the situation "under control." He told CNN he planned to direct rescue and relief efforts overnight.\n\nWitnesses reported guests drowned in their hotel rooms near the coast as 10 meter (30-foot) waves washed ashore.\n\nOthers reported narrow escapes -- including a Spaniard who had been aboard a boat when the wave approached.\n\nThe captain began screaming and turned the boat directly into a nearby shore, where he beached it.\n\nAs those aboard jumped from the craft and scrambled up the steep beach, they turned back to see the waves crush their boat, the Spaniard said.\n\nCommunication difficulties\n\nMore than 500 people have been confirmed dead in Indonesia -- many of them in Aceh, in northern Sumatra, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) from the quake\'s epicenter, according to local reports.\n\nThe quake also inflicted heavy damage on the area, which is a hotbed of rebel activity, before two tsunamis slammed the coastline.\n\nAccess and communications were difficult if not impossible; the death toll remained a mystery on the west coast of Aceh, where communications had been completely wiped out. News agencies in the country have reported more than 4,000 dead.\n\nThe tsunamis struck with no warning to those in coastal areas, as no warning system exists for the Indian Ocean, said Eddie Bernard, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\'s Pacific Marine and Environmental Labs in Seattle.\n\nStaffers at warning centers that cover the Pacific Basin and the U.S. West Coast were aware of the quake and the possibility of tsunamis, said Laura Kong, director of the International Tsunami Information Center in Honolulu, Hawaii.\n\n"They were able to make contact, but they did not have the proper government officials to notify," she said. "They\'ll be working on this in the future."\n\nThe earthquake is classified as "great" -- the strongest classification given by the NEIC.\n\nNEIC geophysicist Don Blakeman said the tsunamis were triggered by the initial massive jolt.\n\n"The damage is just phenomenal," said Jan Egelund, U.N. emergency relief coordinator. "I think we are seeing now one of the worst natural disasters ever."\n\nAftershocks\n\nThere was disagreement over whether the threat was over. Waverly Person, Blakeman\'s colleague at NEIC, said the tsunamis are "long over" and residents and visitors should not worry about further tsunamis.\n\nBernard, however, said the aftershocks are strong enough to produce more tsunamis.\n\nOne such aftershock, measuring 7.3 in magnitude, struck about 300 kilometers (200 miles) northwest of Banda Aceh -- on Sumatra\'s northernmost tip -- more than four hours after the initial quake, according to the NEIC.\n\nThe center expects the quake to produce hundreds of smaller aftershocks, under 4.6 magnitude, and thousands smaller than that.\n\n"A quake of this size has some pretty serious effects," Person said.\n\nThe quake represented the energy released from "a very large rupture in the earth\'s crust" more than 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) long. The rupture created shock waves that pushed the water at speeds of up to several hundred kilometers per hour.\n\nIt was the strongest earthquake to hit anywhere on Earth since March 1964, when a 9.2 quake struck near Alaska\'s Prince William Sound.\n\nThe strongest recorded earthquake (and records go back to 1899) registered 9.5 on May 22, 1960, in Chile.\n\nSunday\'s quake hit a year after the 6.6-magnitude quake in Bam, Iran, which killed more than 30,000 people, injured another 30,000 and destroyed 85 percent of the buildings in the southeastern Iran city.', 'title': 'Asia quake death toll tops 13,000', 'url': 'http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/asiapcf/12/26/asia.quake/', 'keywords': ['relief', 'kilometers', 'tops', 'quake', 'earthquake', 'sri', 'coast', 'asia', 'tsunamis', 'toll', 'area', 'death', '13000', 'waves', 'thousands'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'The tsunamis also left thousands injured, thousands missing and hundreds of thousands homeless in Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka and Thailand.\nThe quake struck about 7 a.m. Sunday (midnight GMT Saturday), according to the U.S. Geological Survey\'s National Earthquake Center.\nAlthough India was giving aid to Sri Lanka, that country also was reeling from the aftermath of the quake and tsunamis.\nThe center expects the quake to produce hundreds of smaller aftershocks, under 4.6 magnitude, and thousands smaller than that.\nThe quake represented the energy released from "a very large rupture in the earth\'s crust" more than 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) long.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'The Asian tsunami: why there were no warnings\n\nBy Peter Symonds\n\n3 January 2005\n\nAs the horrifying toll of death and destruction continues to mount in southern Asia, it becomes ever more obvious that lives could have been saved if a tsunami warning system had been in place. With just 15 to 30 minutes notice, and clear directives to flee, many people who had no idea what was happening, or how to react, could have escaped to safety.\n\nThe tsunami and the earthquake that triggered it are natural phenomena. While earthquakes cannot be forecast they can be quickly pinpointed. Moreover, if the appropriate scientific equipment is in place, the formation of a tsunami can also be detected and its likely path predicted and even tracked.\n\nA tsunami warning system has existed in the Pacific Ocean since the late 1940s. It was substantially upgraded after a tidal wave, triggered by a massive earthquake, killed more than 100 people in Alaska in 1964. In addition to seismological instruments that register tremors, a network of sea level gauges and deep-sea sensors or “tsunameters” linked by satellite to round-the-clock monitoring stations is based in Hawaii, Alaska and Japan. Using computer modelling, scientists can predict the likely propagation of tsunamis and their probable impact.\n\nThere is no such system in the Indian Ocean. Of the 11 countries affected by last week’s calamity, only Thailand and Indonesia belong to the Pacific Ocean tsunami warning system. Most of the nations have seismological units that detected the earthquake. Not all quakes, however, generate tsunamis. In the absence of planning, preparation and additional equipment, it is difficult to make accurate predictions. And time is of the essence, since tsunami waves travel at speeds of up to 800kmh, depending on the depth of the water.\n\nThe December 26 earthquake registered 9 on the Richter scale, making it the largest since the Alaskan quake and one of the most massive in the last century. The epicentre of the initial tremor was off the northwest coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra, followed by a series of aftershocks that ran north through the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal. Two tectonic or continental plates—the Asian and Indian—shifted along a 1,000km fault line by as much as 20 metres, releasing energy equivalent to more than 20,000 nuclear bombs of the size dropped on Hiroshima in 1945.\n\nThe quake occurred just before 8 a.m. Sumatran time [1 a.m. GMT]. Eight minutes later, an alarm was triggered at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre in Hawaii by seismic signals transmitted from stations in Australia. Three minutes after that, a message was sent to other observatories in the Pacific. At 8.14 a.m., an alert notified all countries participating in the network about the quake, indicating that it posed no threat of a tsunami to the Pacific.\n\nAn hour later, the centre revised its initial estimate of the size of the tremor from 8 to 8.5, and issued a second alert, warning of a possible tsunami in the Indian Ocean. Frantic phone calls were made to issue warnings. But without procedures in place for the Indian Ocean, it was hit and miss. “We started thinking about who we could call. We talked to the State Department Operations Centre and to the military. We called embassies. We talked to the navy in Sri Lanka, any local government official we could get hold of,” geophysicist Barry Hirshorn told the Honolulu Advertiser.\n\nIn the countries in the path of the tsunami, the response was disorganised and lethargic. The few who were aware of the dangers were hampered by lack of preparation, bureaucratism and inadequate infrastructure. Others either did not know how to interpret the warning signs, or were indifferent to them. None of the countries surrounding the Bay of Bengal issued an official warning, leaving millions of people completely at the mercy of the approaching waves.\n\nIndonesia\n\nNorthern Sumatra was closest to the quake’s epicentre. The huge tremor, which immediately destroyed buildings throughout the province of Aceh, was followed within half an hour by the tsunami that hit the west coast. It then curled around the northern tip, flattening the provincial capital of Banda Aceh, and proceeded down the east coast. Everyone was caught unaware, including the police and the military.\n\nWhile an official warning may have come too late for many on Aceh’s west coast, the lack of basic education probably lifted the toll by thousands. After the tremor, the sea suddenly retreated hundreds of metres, but no one knew what this meant. Intrigued by the phenomenon, villagers, particularly children, followed the water out, picking up stranded fish, only to be engulfed by the wall of water that followed. Many simply stood there transfixed and uncomprehending.\n\nAccording to an article in the scientific magazine Nature, the only seismological equipment in Indonesia capable of providing an early warning was on the island of Java. It was installed in 1996 but had no telephone line following an office relocation in 2000. According to Nanang Puspito, head of the earthquake laboratory at the Bandung Institute of Technology, officials in Jakarta were alerted to the earthquake, but the absence of data from the specialised Java station prevented them issuing a tsunami warning.\n\nThailand\n\nSeismologists in Thailand registered the Sumatran earthquake soon after it took place. Thai Meteorological Department officials were attending a seminar when the news came in. They immediately convened an emergency meeting, which was chaired by the department’s director-general, Supharerk Tansrirat-tanawong. The Nation newspaper, citing unnamed sources at the meeting, reported that the danger of a tsunami was discussed, but the gathering decided not to issue a warning.\n\nWith no tidal and other sensors in place, the meteorologists had no means of confirming whether a tsunami was on its way. Moreover, they knew there would be repercussions from both government and business if they issued a false warning. This was peak tourist season and the hotels were full. As one official explained to the Nation: “If we issued a warning, which would have led to evacuation, [and if nothing happened], what would happen then? Business would be instantaneously affected. It would be beyond the Meteorological Department’s ability to handle. We could go under if [the tsunami] didn’t come.”\n\nThe meeting was convened nearly an hour before the tsunami battered the coastline of southern Thailand, along with the tourist resorts of Phuket and Phangnga.\n\nSri Lanka\n\nAlthough Sri Lanka is not part of the Pacific tsunami warning system, through the efforts of the Hawaii station some officials were informed that a tsunami could be developing. The wave took about two hours to cross the Bay of Bengal and hit the island’s east coast.\n\nSarath Weerawarnakula, director of Sri Lanka’s Geological Survey and Mines Bureau, told the World Socialist Web Site that his organisation received an alert from international bodies about the quake. Asked about his response, Weerawarnakula became defensive. It took time to decipher the meaning of the messages, he said, but refused to divulge when they actually arrived. Likening an earthquake to a heart attack, he declared: “No one can predict it.” When asked about tsunamis, he acknowledged that sometimes warnings could be made. He insisted, however, that on December 26, it had been “impossible” and hung up.\n\nIn comments to the Lankadeepa newspaper, Weerawarnakula justified the failure to issue a warning. While claiming that his department’s facilities and international connections were adequate, he explained that earthquake data had to be sent to a centre in California for processing. “That takes at least one hour. However such information cannot determine how serious the tidal effect of a particular earthquake is.... Whatever the allegations about our work our organisation works round the clock efficiently. Therefore I reject the allegations.”\n\nWhat has been conclusively established is that the warning systems in Sri Lanka and throughout the region are totally inadequate. Weerawarnakula’s attempt to justify the unjustifiable simply demonstrates that, in the face of evidence of a massive earthquake and possible tsunami, authorities on the island were paralysed. Exactly who knew what, and when, will probably never be investigated. Even after the tsunami hit the east coast, no official action was taken to alert people elsewhere. In relatively shallow water, the wave took up to an hour to sweep around the island and hit the south and west coasts.\n\nIndia\n\nThe Indian authorities confronted many of the same obstacles as their counterparts in other countries. But they had one advantage: the Indian airforce maintains a base on the remote Andaman and Nicobar islands—Indian territory in the middle of the Bay of Bengal situated close to the earthquake’s epicentre. It was not a matter of guessing whether or not a tsunami would form. Shortly after the earthquake, the wave swept over the islands and the airforce base.\n\nAccording to a report in the Indian Express, the airbase in Madras received communications from the Nicobar Islands an hour before the tsunami struck southern India. Air Force Chief S. Krishnaswamy told the newspaper: “The last message from Car Nicobar base was that the island is sinking and there is water all over.” The chief instructed his assistant to alert New Delhi, which he did—by fax—to the home of the former science and technology minister. No further action was taken and no tsunami warning was issued for Madras or for other southern Indian towns and cities.\n\nWhy was there no Indian Ocean warning system?\n\nIn the wake of the disaster, calls are being made for a tsunami warning system to be established for the Indian Ocean. Everyone—from the Indian and Thai governments to their counterparts in Canberra and Washington—is pledging to set one up. According to the UN, the necessary steps could be taken within a year. But the obvious question is: why was a system comparable to the one in the Pacific not established previously?\n\nPrior to last week’s catastrophe, the handful of scientists advocating such a system were generally regarded as crackpots. Seven years ago, Samith Dhamasaroj, then director general of the Thai Meteorological Department, warned of the possibility of a devastating tsunami hitting the country’s southern coast. Some branded him “crazy” and he was sidelined.\n\nDhamasaroj told the Australian: “I suggested an early warning system be put in place for tidal waves, such as alarm sirens at beachside hotels in Phuket, Phangnga and Krabi, the three provinces which have now been hit. I alerted senior officials in these provinces, but no one paid any attention.” He said that some provinces had banned him from entering their territories as “they said I was damaging their image with foreign tourists.”\n\nOther scientists have made similar proposals, which have been shelved or stalled for lack of funds. According to Nature, “The need for a similar system in the Indian Ocean [to the Pacific] has been discussed at regular intervals by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, the UN body that runs the Pacific network, since at least 1999.” Vasily Titov, a tsunami researcher in the US told the magazine: “It is always on the agenda... Only two weeks ago it would have sounded crazy. But it sounds very reasonable now. The millions of dollars needed would have saved thousands and thousands of lives.”\n\nAs recently as October 2003, Australian-based seismologist Dr Phil Cummins called on the International Coordination Group for the Tsunami Warning System in the Pacific to extend its reach to the Indian Ocean. According to the New York Times, the meeting in Wellington, New Zealand rebuffed him and declared in the minutes that such an expansion would mean redefining the group’s terms of reference. Instead, it voted to establish a “sessional working group” to study the problem.\n\nThe costs associated with Cummins’ proposal are relatively minor. One academic cited in the Los Angeles Times estimated that a hi-tech system covering not just the Indian Ocean, but all of the world’s oceans, could be set up for as little as $150 million. Sea-level gauges cost as little as $5,000 each. The better ones, linked to high-speed communications, are more expensive—about $20,000. So-called tsunameters, which detect the passage of a tsunami in deep water, cost $250,000 each and require regular maintenance.\n\nAll of the sensors, including seismological input, have to be linked to round-the-clock monitoring stations manned by trained scientific staff. Equally important is a program of training and education designed to make officials and the public aware of the dangers and what to do in the event of a warning.\n\nThe failure to establish such a system is bound up with shortsightedness, inertia and outright contempt—especially on the part of the major powers—for the lives of the oppressed masses of southern Asia. Destructive tsunamis are actually more common in the Indian Ocean than in the Pacific Ocean, but none of the G-8 countries borders the region. Both Japan and the United States have spent millions on a string of tsunameters and monitoring stations in the Pacific to protect their coastlines, but, prior to last week’s disaster, neither country offered to pay for its extension to the Indian.\n\nLast week’s catastrophe also raises broader questions. The absence of a tsunami warning system for southern Asia is symptomatic of the general state of affairs regarding disasters, such as flooding and cyclones, that occur regularly throughout the region. The very scale of the tsunami tragedy has provoked the sympathy of ordinary people around the world, compelling governments to respond, even if insufficiently and belatedly. Yet every year thousands of impoverished people die or become homeless as a result of natural disasters in Asia, and the events barely rate a mention in the international media.\n\nCommenting on the current crisis, Indian scientist Roddam Narasimha caustically asked: “Even if we had the two-hour warning for tsunami, based on scientific data, what would the [Indian] administration do about it? Who would have called whom, and how would they have conveyed the warning to the people?” He pointed out that New Delhi had failed to learn anything from the cyclone that devastated the Indian state of Orissa several years ago. “The administration had a two-day advance warning about the Orissa supercyclone, but what happened? So, could they have done in two hours what they couldn’t do in two days?”\n\nWhile Narasimha’s indignation is justly directed at the Indian administration, his comments constitute an indictment of other regional governments and the major capitalist powers, which routinely wash their hands of any responsibility for the plight of the masses of South Asia. The cost of establishing a tsunami warning system in the Indian Ocean is a pittance compared to the huge profits amassed by US, European and Japanese corporations through the exploitation of the region’s cheap labour. In the final analysis, the absence of adequate disaster management systems is a product of the same social and economic order that condemns billions of people to wretched daily poverty and treats their sufferings as inevitable and unavoidable.', 'title': 'The Asian tsunami: why there were no warnings', 'url': 'https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2005/01/warn-j03.html', 'keywords': ['system', 'southern', 'hour', 'pacific', 'earthquake', 'place', 'tsunami', 'asian', 'indian', 'warning', 'ocean', 'warnings'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'A tsunami warning system has existed in the Pacific Ocean since the late 1940s.\nOf the 11 countries affected by last week’s calamity, only Thailand and Indonesia belong to the Pacific Ocean tsunami warning system.\nEight minutes later, an alarm was triggered at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre in Hawaii by seismic signals transmitted from stations in Australia.\nSri LankaAlthough Sri Lanka is not part of the Pacific tsunami warning system, through the efforts of the Hawaii station some officials were informed that a tsunami could be developing.\nIn the wake of the disaster, calls are being made for a tsunami warning system to be established for the Indian Ocean.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'Before giant waves slammed into Sri Lanka and India coastlines ten days ago, wild and domestic animals seemed to know what was about to happen and fled to safety.\n\nAccording to eyewitness accounts, the following events happened:\n\n• Elephants screamed and ran for higher ground.\n\n• Dogs refused to go outdoors.\n\n• Flamingos abandoned their low-lying breeding areas.\n\n• Zoo animals rushed into their shelters and could not be enticed to come back out.\n\nThe belief that wild and domestic animals possess a sixth sense—and know in advance when the earth is going to shake—has been around for centuries.\n\nWildlife experts believe animals\' more acute hearing and other senses might enable them to hear or feel the Earth\'s vibration, tipping them off to approaching disaster long before humans realize what\'s going on.\n\nThe massive tsunami was triggered by a magnitude 9 temblor off the coast of northern Sumatra island on December 26.

Another friend, who lives on the coast near Galle, said his two dogs would not go for their daily run on the beach.\n\n"They are usually excited to go on this outing," Corea said. But on this day they refused to go and most probably saved his life.\n\nAlan Rabinowitz, director for science and exploration at the Bronx Zoo-based Wildlife Conservation Society in New York, says animals can sense impending danger by detecting subtle or abrupt shifts in the environment.\n\n"Earthquakes bring vibrational changes on land and in water while storms cause electromagnetic changes in the atmosphere," he said. "Some animals have acute sense of hearing and smell that allow them to determine something coming towards them long before humans might know that something is there."\n\nDid Humans Lose Their Sixth Sense?\n\nAt one time humans also had this sixth sense, Rabinowitz said, but lost the ability when it was no longer needed or used.\n\nJoyce Poole is director of the Savanna Elephant Vocalization Project, which has its headquarters in Norway. She has worked with African elephants in Kenya for 25 years. She said the reports of Sri Lanka\'s elephants fleeing to higher ground didn\'t surprise her.\n\nResearch on both acoustic and seismic communication indicates that elephants could easily pick up vibrations generated from the massive earthquake-tsunami, she said.\n\nPoole has also experienced this firsthand.\n\n"I have been with elephants during two small tremors, and on both occasions the elephants ran in alarm several seconds before I felt the tremor," she said.\n\nOne of the world\'s most earthquake-prone countries is Japan, where devastation has taken countless lives and caused enormous damage to property. Researchers there have long studied animals in hopes of discovering what they hear or feel before the earth shakes. They hope that animals may be used as a prediction tool.\n\nSome U.S. seismologists, on the other hand, are skeptical. There have been documented cases of strange animal behavior prior to earthquakes. But the United States Geological Survey, a government agency that provides scientific information about the Earth, says a reproducible connection between a specific behavior and the occurrence of a quake has never been made.\n\n"What we\'re faced with is a lot of anecdotes," said Andy Michael, a geophysicist at USGS.

The tsunami washed up many land mines, leaving them scattered on the ground.\n\nThe Tamil Tiger rebels have established a virtual clampdown the northern and eastern regions of the country, hampering aid distribution.\n\nResidents have been warned to stick to only the few major roads that leaders are trying to secure. No one can enter without going through rebel checkpoints.\n\nIn southern parts of Sri Lanka controlled by the government, more than 50 aid flights have arrived.\n\nSri Lankan officials have said they are coordinating with Tamil Tigers to get supplies to rebel-controlled areas, but some rebel leaders have accused the government of neglect.\n\nOther nations and international aid groups want to send another 100 flights full of supplies, but the government has said it doesn\'t have the capacity for that many planes.\n\nTales of survival\n\nThousands of people in the country are living in Buddhist temples and churches. They share remarkable stories of survival.\n\nOne man said when the waves hit he took shelter in a tree, clinging to branches for days as the water remained high. He eventually fell down, fracturing a leg.\n\nHe counts himself among the lucky ones; he was reunited with his family.\n\nOthers in the shelters recounted having been in their boats in the harbor when the tsunami struck, saying they were tossed around like toys, but miraculously did not drown.\n\nChip Lyons with UNICEF said his organization\'s teams in the region still "have to get a handle" on the survival needs.\n\nThey have begun distributing tablets that mix with water and help cure diarrhea -- which he called the number one cause of preventable death among children after such disasters.\n\nAid groups will work to reconnect young people with extended family members or others who can take care of them, and will bring them together with other children.\n\nLyons said that at this time even a simple game of kickball and makeshift classrooms could help establish a semblance of normalcy.\n\nAmid the devastation, Friday brought a glimmer of hope. In some places, as the new year arrived, people broke into celebrations. In Sri Lanka, they violated a national day of mourning that banned such events.\n\nThoughts for tsunami victims tempered New Year\'s Eve festivities. Several major cities canceled parties, and Australia held a minute of silence.

It is the fourth strongest since recordings of magnitude began in 1899, tying a 1952 quake in Kamchatka, Russia.\n\nThe three stronger quakes: May 22, 1960, in Chile (9.5); the 1964 quake (9.2); and a March 9, 1957, quake on Andreanof Island, Alaska (9.1). All three of those quakes, along with the Kamchatka quake, created tsunamis.\n\nTsunami information\n\nTsunamis are formed by a displacement of water -- a landslide, volcanic eruption, or, as in this case, slippage of the boundary between two of the earth's tectonic plates -- slabs of rock 50 to 650 feet (15 to 200 km) thick that carry the Earth's continents and seas on an underground ocean of much hotter, semi-solid material.\n\nThe December 26 tsunami was caused by slippage of about 600 miles (1,000 km) of the boundary between the India and Burma plates off the west coast of northern Sumatra. The convergence of other plates strains the area, and at the quake's epicenter, the India plate is moving to the northeast at 2 inches (5 cm) per year relative to the Burma plate. The aftershocks were distributed along the plate boundary from the epicenter to near Andaman Island.\n\nTsunamis can travel up to 600 mph (965 k/ph, 521 knots) at the deepest point of the water, but slow as they near the shore, eventually hitting the shore at 30 to 40 mph (48 to 64 k/ph, 26 to 35 knots), according to Charles McCreevy, director of the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. The energy of the wave's speed is transferred to height and sheer force as it nears shore.\n\nThe 7.3 magnitude aftershock might have been powerful enough to create further tsunamis, but did not.\n\nHistorical information\n\nThe Chilean quake and tsunamis were responsible for 5,700 deaths, and the Prince William Sound quake and tsunamis killed 125; the Andreanof Island and Kamchatka events killed no one.\n\nThe deadliest earthquake recorded since 1900 occurred on July 27, 1976, in Tangshan, China, when the official death count reach 255,000 for a 7.5 magnitude quake.

There are still some out there," Penang Civil Defence Director Mohd Johari Mohd Taufik told Reuters.\n\nHe said the eight who died at the Batu Ferringhi beach were mostly picnickers who were swept out to sea. "There may be some who are still missing," he added. Police said 30 others were injured.\n\nThe island is popular with Westerners and local visitors, and hotels in the area are normally packed during the peak of the holiday season.

The Herald flew over it yesterday in the first aircraft carrying emergency supplies to Simeulue. But three days after the quake and following tsunami, Meulaboh had not received any outside help or emergency supplies such as medicine, food or water. Not until hours after our fly-over did soldiers finally arrive to find at least 3400 dead and 80 per cent of the buildings wrecked.\n\nWe could see tiny figures walking amid the debris. They must have been desperate for food and water. We couldn\'t see any bodies, but as we now know, there were many.

Silalahi, a special envoy of Indonesia\'s President, said last night he believed the death and destruction in Meulaboh was greater than anywhere else in Indonesia.\n\n"Only 20 per cent of buildings are left," he said. "We can only make a guess about the exact number of deaths but it is in the thousands." Mr Silalahi, a retired army general, said 300 soldiers based in the town were washed out to sea.

In the 1880s, close to the epicentre of this Boxing Day's earthquake, huge waves crashed into countries all around the Indian Ocean. It was the eruption of the volcano Krakatoa.\n\nLike earthquakes, volcanoes form at weak points in the Earth's crust\n\nA German, the manager of a quarry, wrote his recollections of being swept away.\n\nHe was carried off the top of his three-storey office building at the summit of a 30m high hill.\n\nThe tsunami that roared in from the sea that Monday morning in 1883 must have been 40m high, at least.\n\nHe recalled being carried along on the wave's green unbroken crest, watching the jungle racing below, paralysed with fear.\n\nThen suddenly to his right, he saw, being swept along beside him, an enormous crocodile.\n\nWith incredible presence-of-mind he decided the only way to save himself was to leap aboard the crocodile and try to ride to safety on its back.\n\nHow he did it is anyone's guess, but he insists he leapt on, dug his thumbs into the creature's eye-sockets to keep himself stable, and surfed on it for 3km.\n\nThe loudest sound ever made since mankind was around to note such things\n\n\n\nHe held on until the wave broke on a distant hill, depositing him and a presumably very irritated croc on the jungle floor.\n\nHe ran, survived, and wrote about the story.\n\n'First modern catastrophe'\n\nIt is an account now formally recorded in the archives as part of the official report of the first catastrophe of the modern age, the eruption of Krakatoa in August, 1883.\n\nThe same geological suture line that caused the recent Sumatran earthquake was responsible for Krakatoa, and the effects, tragic and disastrous, were uncannily similar and world-affecting.\n\nFirst came an ear-splitting bang.\n\nIt was the loudest sound ever made since mankind started noting such things.\n\nThe police chief over on Rodriguez Island heard it clearly, like a cannonade of naval gunfire, but he was 4,776km away.\n\nIt was like people in London hearing, with perfect clarity, an explosion in Baltimore, or Khartoum.\n\nThen the island exploded with a cataclysmic eruption, hurling a tower of ash, cloud and fire nearly 48km high, and raining down enormous islands of pumice, which were later found floating, laden with skeletons, 6,500km away.\n\nAnd then there were the waves, four of them.\n\nImmensely tall, immensely fast, felt as far away as France and England.\n\nThey smashed into the shores on Java and Sumatra, laying waste to everything, killing nearly 40,000 people.\n\nAftermath\n\nWreckage lay uncleared for years.\n\nAn iron naval patrol boat was carried nearly three miles inland, and stayed there for more than a century.\n\nI found bits of it, rusted and covered with creepers, back in the 1990s.\n\nThe debris is almost cleared on a beach in Phuket, Thailand\n\nPhysically, the East Indian islands recovered, as mankind always does.\n\nAfter all, the biggest volcanoes in human history, Toba and Tambora, exploded nearby, but their only legacy is myth, and their miseries are long forgotten.\n\nBut psychologically and physically the effects of Krakatoa were profound, as the intangible consequences of truly immense tragedies often are.\n\nThe defining difference about Krakatoa was that the news of it spread around

Some anthropological DNA studies indicate the generations may have spanned back 70,000 years. They originated in Africa and migrated to India through Indonesia, anthropologists say.\n\nGovernment officials and anthropologists believe that ancient knowledge of the movement of wind, sea and birds may have saved the indigenous tribes from the tsunami.\n\nSeven men — wearing only underwear and amulets — emerged from the forest to meet with government officials to say they had all fled to the forest and survived by eating coconuts.

As of yesterday, the official death toll had risen to more than 50,000. But government officials are warning that the figure will rise to at least 100,000 as relief teams reach more remote areas, particularly on the west coast.\n\nAceh, the province closest to the earthquake’s epicentre, is the worst affected. The region has been under military rule since May 2003 when Jakarta poured in more than 50,000 troops in an attempt to crush separatist rebels. The area remains under the effective control of the army, which is responsible for much of the relief effort, or lack of it.\n\nThe provincial capital of Banda Aceh on the northernmost tip of Sumatra has been devastated. The Jakarta Post described the capital, which had a population of 400,000, as the “city of the dead”. Much of it has been levelled and there are thousands of dead. But no one is sure how many corpses are still being uncovered. Among those killed were almost all of the 80 journalists of Aceh’s only daily newspaper Serambi Indonesia.\n\nThe Washington Post painted a similar picture. “[Corpses] lay along the muddy median strip, unclaimed, unknown. They rested in the middle of intersections and atop heaps of wood and corrugated metal from the shops that once did a brisk trade in electronics, tailoring and groceries... Many were small children, as overlooked as the abandoned stuffed animals that lay nearby.”\n\nOnly now, with reports beginning to filter in from other areas, is the full extent of the tragedy becoming clear. Much of the west coast has been cut off as a result of extensive damage to roads. On Tuesday, the military finally dispatched an aircraft to over-fly the area and survey the damage.\n\nThe large town of Meulaboh, which had a population of 40,000, has been almost completely levelled. A Sydney Morning Herald journalist who flew over Meulaboh described the scene. “[I]t looks like the people of Meulaboh never got the chance to run. Picture the bombed Hiroshima—that’s what it looks like ... Meulaboh had not received any outside help or emergency supplies such as medicine, food or water ... We could see tiny figures walking among the debris. They must have been desperate for food and water”.\n\nA police officer who left Meulaboh on Tuesday morning told Agence France-Presse that when he left “they only had enough food for a day. I told my men to try to sustain themselves by eating coconuts, but they will only last for another day. I saw residents in the area scavenging for dirty rice on the ground.” Sea water, debris, corpses and sewerage have contaminated drinking water in virtually every affected area.\n\nAccording to a military spokesman, the first six tonnes of supplies arrived in the town via two naval vessels on Thursday—five days after the tsunami hit. A Sydney Morning Herald reporter who reached Meulaboh yesterday described the suffering as “unimaginable”. Most of the survivors had received no food, drinking water, medicines or outside help and were desperate. Yuda Suria, a father of two, begged: “Please help me. Please. We have had no rice or water for two days. How can we live?”\n\nEstimates of the number killed in the town vary from 10,000 to 20,000. If the surrounding district is included, the figure could be 40,000. As of Thursday, many areas had yet to be reached, including islands off the west coast. A police officer who reached Meulaboh on Wednesday reported that only several hundred of the 6,000-strong fishing community of Calang survived. After a helicopter tour, provincial military commander Major-General Endang Suwarya said 75 percent of the west coast was destroyed and whole communities wiped out.\n\nMany more lives could be lost from disease and starvation unless supplies arrive in Aceh quickly. According to David Nabarro, head of the World Health Organisation crisis team, “Perhaps as many as five million people are not able to access what they need for living. Either they cannot get water, or their sanitation is inadequate or they cannot get food.”\n\nHospitals are overwhelmed by the number of patients. One of three hospitals operating in Banda Aceh had to turn away victims yesterday. Dr Andalas said that the hospital needed at least 200 more doctors and 600 paramedics, as well as vitamins and basic medicines to treat diarrhoea and influenza. In outlying areas of Aceh, the situation is even worse.\n\nThe relief effort, however, is chaotic and limited. Michael Elmquist, UN humanitarian aid co-ordinator in Jakarta, announced yesterday that in the coming days the UN would provide 12 tonnes of biscuits, 8 tonnes of noodles, half a tonne of medical supplies, 5,000 body bags and 50 generators. But the amounts of aid, Indonesian and international, are dwarfed by the scale of the disaster. Moreover, much of the assistance that has been donated is stacked in warehouses, waiting to be transported to affected areas.\n\nAt one refugee camp on the outskirts of Banda Aceh, families were desperate for food and medicine, while five kilometres away boxes of supplies were stacked in the military’s main air base for the region. Abu Bakar explained to the Washington Post that the Red Cross announced through loudspeakers that refugees from each village should delegate someone to receive rice. “They gave us one sack to share among more than 100 people,” he said. “How can we survive on that amount of supplies?”\n\nThe difficulties facing aid workers are being compounded by the military, which, after launching its offensive last year, imposed severe restrictions on foreign journalists and aid organisations seeking to enter the area. The ban was eased on Wednesday, but Indonesian Vice President Joseph Kalla made clear that no one with “political” reasons would be allowed into the province.\n\nAn article in the New York Times indicated the frosty attitude of the Indonesian military. In response to an Australian offer to provide a forklift and crew to help end the logjam of supplies at the Banda Aceh base, General Bambang Darmono declared that he did not have the authority to accept the proposal. “Come back tomorrow,” he was quoted as saying.\n\nThere are obvious reasons why the Indonesian military is not keen to end the entry restrictions. Its offensive was not simply to destroy the fighters of the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) but to intimidate and cow the entire population. Despite the heavy media censorship, there have been reports of widespread abuses of democratic rights by the military in the past year, including arbitrary detention, torture and extra-judicial killings. At least 1,000 people have been killed in the operation.\n\nMoreover, the current offensive is the continuation of the brutal war waged by the Suharto dictatorship since the 1970s to crush the rebels. The Indonesian military is thoroughly permeated with a chauvinist attitude towards the Acehnese. Army chief Ryamizard Ryacudu declared last December: “People who dislike the military emergency in Aceh are GAM members.”\n\nThere is no doubt that the military’s contempt for the local population is a factor in retarding the relief effort. It is probably the only explanation for the failure to immediately dispatch an aircraft to the west coast to survey the situation. The area was the closest to the epicentre of the earthquake, bore the full brunt of the subsequent tsunami and was clearly one of the worst affected areas.\n\nThe first concern of the military was not, however, providing aid to the victims, but making sure that the military maintained its positions against GAM rebels. Armed forces chief General Endriatono Sutarto inferred on Monday that GAM might use the situation to launch attacks on army units. In fact, the GAM leadership, based in Sweden, issued a directive to its fighters to cease military operations and focus on relief efforts.\n\nAs the scale of the disaster and the plight of the victims became more apparent, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was forced onto the defensive in the face of growing concern and anger in Aceh and throughout the country. He acknowledged that relief operations had been inadequate and promised to speed up supplies. Vice President Joseph Kalla was dispatched to the province as an expression of sympathy. He has since announced that Jakarta will provide more than 10 trillion rupiah, or $US1.07 billion, in funds for immediate relief and long-term reconstruction.\n\nThe nervousness of the Yudhoyono administration is understandable. SBY, as Yudhoyono is known, won the presidential elections earlier this year by capitalising on hostility to Megawati Sukarnoputri over her failure to halt the slide in living standards. His administration’s failure to assist the millions who have been left homeless and without basic essentials in Aceh can only provoke resentment.\n\nIn Aceh itself, these sentiments will be compounded by the fact that Yudhoyono, a former general who was Megawati’s senior security minister, was directly responsible for launching last year’s repressive military operations—at a cost of around 7 trillion rupiah. As immediate shock dissipates, the calamity is likely to generate a wave of anger that can only exacerbate an already unstable political situation.', 'title': 'Tsunami death toll in Indonesia approaching 100,000', 'url': 'https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2004/12/indo-d31.html', 'keywords': ['gam', 'approaching', 'water', 'relief', 'meulaboh', 'military', 'west', 'food', 'tsunami', 'indonesia', 'aceh', 'indonesian', 'toll', 'death', 'supplies', '100000'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Tsunami death toll in Indonesia approaching 100,000By John Roberts31 December 2004Catastrophic is the only word that comes close to describing the impact of Sunday’s earthquake and tsunami on the impoverished Indonesian regions in northern Sumatra.\nAmong those killed were almost all of the 80 journalists of Aceh’s only daily newspaper Serambi Indonesia.\nAn article in the New York Times indicated the frosty attitude of the Indonesian military.\nThere are obvious reasons why the Indonesian military is not keen to end the entry restrictions.\nThe Indonesian military is thoroughly permeated with a chauvinist attitude towards the Acehnese.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'A sensor network capable of detecting an oceanic earthquake and an impending tsunami in the Indian Ocean is feasible, say experts, but will be useless unless backed by improved communications infrastructure in the countries in greatest peril.\n\nThe devastating death toll and damage caused by the tsunami that struck on 26 December 2004 has prompted urgent calls for an early warning system. Indonesia, which has suffered the greatest loss of life in the tragedy – over 80,000 people – has already committed to such a system. And other affected countries and major aid donors are expected to endorse the development of a system at a conference in Jakarta, Indonesia, on Thursday.\n\nThe earthquake responsible for the disaster occurred at a tectonic plate boundary a few hundred kilometres west of the Indonesian island of Sumatra. One tectonic plate slid beneath the other, pushing the sea bed about 10 metres upwards. This generated a giant surge that sped to coastlines around the Indian Ocean.\n\nAn early warning system for tsunamis is already in operation in the Pacific Ocean and consists of a network of seismograph and tidal gauges linked via satellite to monitoring centres based in Alaska, US, and Hawaii.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeismographs provide the first line of defence, alerting monitoring staff to any earthquakes large enough to produce a tsunami. But not every such quake produces these deadly waves, so tidal gauges that record changes in ocean depth are then used to determine whether a tsunami is actually on its way.\n\nHowever, a problem with the system is that three in four tsunami alerts are false alarms. Evacuations in such cases are costly and can breed complacency.\n\nPressure sensors\n\nA more accurate monitoring system, developed by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, began operational use in 2003 and has been incorporated into the Pacific Ocean early warning system. Deep Ocean Assessment and Reporting (DART) sensors use deep-sea pressure detectors that measure changes in water depth as a tsunami wave passes overhead.\n\nThe sensors then transfer the information to a surface buoy, which relays it to the monitoring stations by satellite. The DART system prevented a false alarm on Hawaii just a month after its activation, following a tremor in Alaska. DART is also less vulnerable to earthquake damage than tide gauges but experts insist that multiple detection systems are essential.\n\nOfficials from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii detected the seismic signal from the earthquake on 26 December but were unable to determine when or where a tsunami might strike. Only after hearing media reports that a tsunami had hit Sri Lanka were they able to alert Madagascar and the Mauritius Islands via the State Department in Washington, DC, US.\n\nPhil McFadden chief scientist at Geoscience Australia, which has been commissioned by the Australian government to design an early warning system for the Indian Ocean, says it could consist of 30 seismographs to detect earthquakes, 10 tidal gauges and six DART buoys. He estimates that it would only cost around $20m to install these sensors.\n\nRed light\n\nBut installing a detection system is only one part of the challenge, says David Ovadia, head of British Geological Survey International in Nottingham, UK. He says it is also vital to have a reliable communications system and to educate people about what to do after the alarm is raised.\n\n“It’s one thing knowing a tsunami is coming and another to warn the population in time,” he told New Scientist. “The real problem is what to do after the red light, which is an infrastructure problem.”\n\nMcFadden agrees. “If it’s a tsunami, you’ve got to get the information down to the last Joe on the beach. This is the stuff that is really very hard,” he told the Press Association.\n\nThe critical importance of an effective communications system is highlighted by the fact that some people say they were unable to alert the authorities in their countries to the danger of the Asian earthquake. Samith Dhammasaroj, a meteorological expert in Thailand, realised that the massive ocean quake might produce a deadly tsunami but was unable to contact government officials to raise the alarm.\n\nUnited Nations officials began calling for a tsunami warning system for the Indian Ocean on 29 December. “There is no reason why this cannot be done,” said Sálvano Briceño, director of the UN’s International Strategy for Disaster Reduction. “There is a strong basis of knowledge, technology and collaboration and a real readiness to act.”', 'title': 'Tsunami warning system is not simply sensors', 'url': 'https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn6839-tsunami-warning-system-is-not-simply-sensors/', 'keywords': ['system', 'early', 'sensors', 'gauges', 'simply', 'earthquake', 'tsunami', 'indian', 'dart', 'monitoring', 'ocean', 'warning'], 'tags': {'Earth', 'Health', 'News'}, 'summary': 'The devastating death toll and damage caused by the tsunami that struck on 26 December 2004 has prompted urgent calls for an early warning system.\nPressure sensorsA more accurate monitoring system, developed by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, began operational use in 2003 and has been incorporated into the Pacific Ocean early warning system.\nThe DART system prevented a false alarm on Hawaii just a month after its activation, following a tremor in Alaska.\nOfficials from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii detected the seismic signal from the earthquake on 26 December but were unable to determine when or where a tsunami might strike.\nUnited Nations officials began calling for a tsunami warning system for the Indian Ocean on 29 December.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'U.S. ups tsunami aid from $35 million to $350 million\n\n\n\n\n\n(CNN) -- -- The United States will increase its aid pledge from $35 million to $350 million to help victims of the tsunamis in south Asia, CNN has learned.\n\nThe increase followed criticism that the initial amount was far from enough.\n\nThe director of the U.S. Agency for International Development told CNN on Friday that the $35 million pledge was only the first step in U.S. aid to the countries that were devastated by Sunday\'s earthquake and tsunamis.\n\n"The money was committed on Sunday when the emergency took place," Andrew Natsios told CNN\'s "American Morning."

[AP] Across a dozen countries, millions of people whose homes were swept away or wrecked by raging walls of water Sunday struggled to find shelter. "My mother, no word! My sisters, brothers, aunt, uncle, grandmother, no word!" yelled a woman at a makeshift morgue in Lhokseumawe, Indonesia. "Where are they? Where are they? I don\'t know where to start looking." Along India\'s southeastern coast, hospital teams stood by to help the injured, but three days after the disaster still spent most of their time tabulating the dead as ambulances hauled in more bodies. A French cultural center in Thailand\'s capital provided clothes and food for tourist families left with nothing when the sea battered southern beach resorts. One of the most dramatic illustrations of nature\'s force came to light Tuesday when reporters reached the scene of a Sri Lankan train carrying beachgoers that was swept into a marsh by a wall of water Sunday, killing at least 802. Eight rust-colored cars lay in deep pools of water in a ravaged palm grove, torn off wheels and baggage scattered among the twisted rails. "Is this the fate that we had planned for? My darling, you were the only hope for me," a young man cried for one of the train victims ― his university sweetheart ― as Buddhist monks prayed nearby. Indonesia\'s Health Ministry said in a statement that thousands more bodies were found Tuesday, raising to more than 27,000 the number of confirmed deaths in parts of Sumatra island, the territory closest to the epicenter of the quake that sent tsunami waves rolling across the Indian Ocean. The count did not include a report of 10,000 more dead in the region around one coastal city. A boat lies in a road in Victoria town, Mah Island in the Seychelles, following surges in the water level after an earthquake off the Indonesian island of Sumatra sent devastating tsunami waves across the Indian ocean on Sunday, in this photograph taken on December 27, 2004. [Reuters] Sri Lanka listed 18,700 people dead, India 4,400 and Thailand 1,500, with the toll expected to rise. A total of more than 300 were killed in Malaysia, Myanmar, Bangladesh, the Maldives, Somalia, Tanzania, Seychelles and Kenya. Officials had not yet counted the dead in two zones that suffered the brunt of both the earthquake and the tsunami that followed: the west coast of Sumatra and India\'s remote Andaman and Nicobar archipelagos just north of Sumatra. Purnomo Sidik, national disaster director at Indonesia\'s Social Affairs Ministry, said 10,000 people had been reported killed in and around Meulaboh, a poor Sumatran town where most people are fishermen or workers on palm oil plantations. In India, police said 8,000 people were missing and feared dead on the two island chains. Television footage from overflights of Meulaboh and other parts of Sumatra\'s west coast showed thousands of homes underwater. Refugees fleeing the coast described surviving on little more than coconuts before reaching Banda Aceh, the capital of Aceh province on Sumatra\'s northern tip, which itself was largely flattened by the quake. "The sea was full of bodies," said one refugee, Sukardi Kasdi, who sailed a small boat to Banda Aceh to seek help for his family in Surang. He said his family had nothing to eat but coconuts. "I don\'t know how long everyone else will survive," he said. With aid not arriving quick enough, desperate people in Meulaboh and other towns in Aceh were stealing whatever food they could find, officials said. "People are looting, but not because they are evil, but they are hungry," said Red Cross official Irman Rachmat in Banda Aceh. The flooding uprooted land mines in Sri Lanka ― torn for years by a civil war ― threatening to kill or maim aid workers and survivors attempting to return to what\'s left of their homes. Aid groups struggled to mount what they described as the largest relief operation the world has ever seen, and to head off the threat of cholera and malaria epidemics that could break out where water supplies are polluted with bodies and debris.\n\nVideo grab shows a tidal wave in Penang after tsunami waves hit southern Asia on Sunday in this amateur video footage taken December 26, 2004. [Reuters] Dr. David Nabarro, head of crisis operations for the World Health Organization (news - web sites), warned that disease could take as many lives as Sunday\'s devastation. "The initial terror associated with the tsunamis and the earthquake itself may be dwarfed by the longer term suffering of the affected communities," he told reporters at the U.N. agency\'s offices in Geneva. A government official in India said Sunday\'s devastation had overwhelmed authorities, who were only now getting relief operations under control and starting to address health concerns. "It was all sudden and unexpected. There were just too many bodies to recover," Veera Shanmuga Moni said. "Now that we are close to finishing that job, we will now take care of sanitation and supply of clean water." The United States, Japan, Australia and other nations pledged millions of dollars to help the relief effort, and some sent military transport planes and helicopters to carry medical teams and emergency supplies. In southern Thailand\'s Phang Nga province, where resorts had been packed with thousands of tourists from Europe and elsewhere when the tsunami hit, soldiers and volunteers were still finding bodies lying bloated and rotting in the tropical sun. Survivors lined up at airports to leave the country, many without relatives or lovers they had come with. "I saw many kids perish. I saw parents trying to hold them but it was impossible. It was hell," said Karl Kalteka of Munich, Germany, who lost his girlfriend in the torrent. Amid the devastation, however, there were miraculous stories of survival. In Malaysia, a 20-day-old baby was found alive on a floating mattress and was reunited with her family. In Thailand, 2-year-old Hannes Bergstroem, who was found dazed and alone after the waves hit, was claimed by an uncle after his photograph was posted on the Internet. The Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet reported that the boy\'s mother and grandmother were missing, but later media reports said he was reunited with his grandmother. His father and grandfather were believed to be in another hospital in Thailand, but their exact location and conditions were not immediately known. A U.N. agency has said that one-third of the disaster\'s victims were children.\n\n\n\nClose Today\'s Top News Top World News Chinese aid joins world rescue\n\nTsunami death toll climbs to 52,000\n\nBuilding resumes at Olympic centre\n\nState to speed up public info flow\n\nProperty transfer protection for emigrants\n\nRebels strike Iraqi forces after bin Laden call\n\nTidal waves death toll rises to 40,000 Rebels strike Iraqi forces after bin Laden call Ukraine PM returns to work after election setback US presses for Sunnis in Iraq election Powell, White House hail Ukraine election France apartment building blast kills 17\n\nAdvertisement', 'title': 'Tsunami death toll climbs to 52,000', 'url': 'http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-12/29/content_404155.htm', 'keywords': ['island', 'water', 'bodies', 'earthquake', 'sumatra', 'tsunami', 'climbs', '52000', 'aceh', 'dead', 'toll', 'death', 'waves'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': "Tsunami death toll climbs to 52,000(Agencies)Updated: 2004-12-29 07:56 Desperate refugees foraged for coconuts or looted food on battered Sumatra island Tuesday, as the number killed in a mammoth earthquake and tsunami soared above 52,000 and tens of thousands still were missing.\nGrieving survivors buried their dead by hand, trying to ward off an epidemic that the U.N. health agency warned could double the toll yet again.\nAcehnese women weep over the loss of relatives after tidal waves hit following Sunday's earthquake, at the airport in Banda Aceh, Aceh province, Indonesia, Tuesday, Dec. 28, 2004.\n[Reuters] Sri Lanka listed 18,700 people dead, India 4,400 and Thailand 1,500, with the toll expected to rise.\nVideo grab shows a tidal wave in Penang after tsunami waves hit southern Asia on Sunday in this amateur video footage taken December 26, 2004.", 'date': 1104278400}, {'text': 'There is concern about sanitary conditions in devastated areas\n\nPresident Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has said he wants scientists to work with neighbouring countries on the project.\n\nPeople received no warning as the waves hit the coasts of 12 countries around the Indian Ocean.\n\nIndonesia was among the worst affected, with a loss of more than 94,000 people.

"The disaster was so brutal, so quick, and so far-reaching, that we are still struggling to comprehend it." He said his organization continued to estimate that the final death toll will surpass 150,000 from the giant waves spawned by a 9.0 earthquake off Indonesia\'s northwest coast Dec. 26. "Although we were powerless to stop the tsunami, together we have the power to stop those next waves," Annan said, calling for the establishment of a tsunami warning system in the Indian Ocean.\n\nU.N.

World leaders met on Thursday to discuss tsunami aid, the task\'s urgency underlined by a chilling warning that the death toll could double to about 300,000 without swift action to prevent diseases. [Reuters] Annan appealed $1.7 billion in disaster relief over the next six months for victims of the tsunami, but it wasn\'t immediately clear if that plea included the previous pledges or was a request for more. Early Thursday, a 6.2-magnitude aftershock centered close to the provincial capital Banda Aceh shook the city. Many residents fled into the streets fearing their homes might collapse, but there were no reports of fresh casualties. Hundreds of quakes have rattled the region since Dec. 26, but Thursday\'s was among the strongest.

Wen also offered to share China\'s experience and expertise in earthquake monitoring.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, Secretary of State Colin Powel, one of the first leaders to arrive in Indonesia, and other summit participants got firsthand looks at the apocalyptic landscapes carved out by south Asia\'s tsunami. Powell, a battle-hardened veteran of the Vietnam War, was aghast at the devastation on Indonesia\'s Sumatra island. "I\'ve never seen anything like this," he said. "I cannot begin to imagine the horror that went through the families and all of the people who heard this noise coming and then had their lives snuffed out by this wave," Powell said. "The power of the wave ... to destroy everything in its path is amazing." India has politely turned down the unprecedented offers of money and military might, but many Indonesians appeared to be putting pride aside: During Powell\'s visit, survivors expressed gratitude for American aid.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi (2nd-L) stands next to Indian Foreign Minister Natwar Singh as they take a moment of silence for Tsunami victims before the opening of the Special Asean Leaders\'s Meeting on Aftermath Quake and Tsunami Summit at the Jakarta Convention Centre on January 6, 2005. [Reuters] The summit came just hours after some nations increased their pledges, bringing the worldwide total from governments to about $3.8 billion. Australia promised $810 million ― the largest so far ― topping a $674 million German aid package. The fresh outpouring of generosity appeared at times to be almost like a bidding war and raised questions about whether rich nations were using tragedy to jockey for influence on the world stage and with hardest-hit Indonesia, which has a wealth of natural resources. Louis Michel, the European Commissioner for development and humanitarian aid, urged donors not to engage in one-upsmanship. "We have to be careful and not participate in a beauty contest where we are competing to give higher figures," he said. But U.N. humanitarian chief Jan Egeland, the man who riled Washington by complaining that wealthy nations were often "stingy," said Tuesday: "I\'d rather see competitive compassion than no compassion." Michel also said too many countries were making pledges that may not be honored. A little over a year ago, donors promised Iran more than $1 billion in relief after an earthquake killed 26,000 people there. Iranian officials say only $17.5 million has been sent. Egeland, at the United Nations, called Australia\'s and Germany\'s pledges "phenomenal" and said the offers were so large that his staff members had to ask donors to repeat what they said to make sure they heard the number of zeroes correctly. In the early days of the disaster, Australia pledged $46 million. The country increased that pledge by another $764 million Wednesday, bringing its overall commitment to $810 million, officials said. Most of the pledge is for neighboring Indonesia. "Out of the appalling tragedy of the tsunami has emerged an opportunity to build a new future," Australian Prime Minister John Howard said. Rocky ties between Australia and Indonesia have improved steadily since the nations came together in the aftermath of the 2002 Bali nightclub bombings that killed 202 people, including 88 Australians. The United States was the first to raise the stakes dramatically in the aid race by pledging $350 million on Friday; it now lies fourth on the donor list and has sent in two aircraft carrier groups and thousands of troops. Japan last week promised a $500 million package. The donors\' conference was focusing on how best to allocate the billions in aid following a disaster that wiped out villages and infrastructure, left millions homeless and threatened with disease, and killed more than 139,000 people. Leaders also were to discuss a warning system to prevent massive death tolls from future tsunamis. The World Health Organization said it urgently needs $60 million to provide safe drinking water, sanitation, shelter, food, medical and other supplies to prevent disease outbreaks that would put another 150,000 people at "extreme risk" of dying. The United Nations announced that camps for up to 500,000 tsunami refugees will be built on Sumatra. North Korea has chipped in with a pledge of $150,000. Convicts in Malaysia were donating money earned doing prison work, and war-torn Afghanistan planned to send doctors. Some refugees on the eastern coast of Sri Lanka began returning home after 10 days in limbo. They went back however they could ― on foot, by bicycle or in motorized rickshaw taxis. But most of the survivors from Nasuvantivu village found they had nothing to go back to. Subramaniam Nadarasa\'s once solid brick home, set among coconut trees on the sandy beach, was stripped to its cement floor. Blocks of the blue-painted walls lay broken. A pot and his crumpled blue bicycle were all that remained of his possessions.\n\n\n\nClose Today\'s Top News Top World News Premier Wen proposes more aid and co-operation\n\nStrategic oil reserves to be filled next year\n\nChina urges US to lift sanctions\n\n1.3 billionth citizen welcomed in mixed mood\n\nTen faces of 2004\'s economy\n\nWB: China\'s economy faces challenges\n\nOfficials warn of jump in tsunami deaths Iraq extends emergency laws for elections Nine American troops killed in Iraq Ukraine supreme court throws out election challenge Bush set to name Zoellick as deputy to Rice Internal US poll shows Sunnis not likely to vote\n\nAdvertisement', 'title': 'World leaders open tsunami aid summit in Jakarta', 'url': 'http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-01/06/content_406544.htm', 'keywords': ['disaster', 'summit', 'million', 'aid', 'nations', 'tsunami', 'indonesia', 'world', 'open', 'jakarta', 'leaders'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': "World leaders open tsunami aid summit in Jakarta(Agencies)Updated: 2005-01-06 13:17 World leaders opened an emergency summit Thursday with a moment of silence for the tens of thousands of tsunami victims, before focusing on the best way to rush nearly $4 billion pledged worldwide to millions of survivors.\nGlobal leaders gathering in Jakarta to discuss the tsunami that devastated countries around the Indian Ocean will try to draw lessons from the disaster, including looking at a future warning system.\nU.N.

Millions were left homeless a day after the biggest quake in four decades sent tidal waves crashing into nine countries and as far as Africa. With thousands still missing, the tally may rise, officials said. Among the missing are tourists from China. Besides the death of a tourist from Taiwan province, dozens were confirmed injured Monday. In worst-hit Sri Lanka, the death toll reached 12,029, according to military officials and websites reporting from Tamil areas outside the government\'s control.\n\nVideo grab shows a tidal wave in Penang after tsunami waves hit southern Asia on Sunday in this amateur video footage taken December 26, 2004. [Reuters] Indonesia and India also reported thousands dead each, and Thailand said hundreds were dead there. Deaths also were reported in Malaysia, Maldives, Myanmar, Bangladesh and even in Somalia, 4,800 kilometres away in Africa. Sri Lanka and Indonesia had at least a million people each driven from their homes. As of Monday evening, 19 people from Hong Kong and six from the mainland had been admitted to hospitals in the tsunami-hit regions. Though two tourists from Zhejiang Province missing the day before were found alive Monday, a number of Chinese nationals remain missing in Thailand. Moreover, some Chinese tourists were straggled in two resort islands in Maldives, said Cao Xiaojian, an official with the local embassy. "There is no danger but there may be some difficulties with food and accommodation," he said by telephone. Secretary for Security, Ambrose Lee, citing Hong Kong Travel Industry Council information, said over 1,000 Hong Kong people in 30 to 40 groups were in Phuket when the tsunami hit. Many of them lost their travel documents while making their escape. Lee admitted a number of Hong Kong people were still missing. In Maldives, eight tourists were held back in the White Sand Beach Resort while the two other travel groups from Shanghai and Hong Kong, made up of 21 and 14 people, were on Paradise Island. They are expected to fly back as soon as the airport resumes the operation. There were no reports of injured Chinese citizens in Indonesia, where the earthquake took place, , said He Shiqing, an official with the local embassy. When the disaster hit, Executive Councillor Leung Chun-ying was on vacation in the Pacific resort of the Maldives, while Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing chairman Charles Lee and Democratic Party chairman Lee Wing-tat were in Phuket. All are safe. Chinese kung fu film star Jet Li, who was in the Maldives on holiday,called his Hong Kong agent to report he and his family are safe. Helping hands As people are searching for more victims of the disaster, aid agencies around the world were rushing staff, equipment and money to southern Asia. The Chinese Government said it is ready to help its citizens as well as provide assistance to disaster stricken countries. The State Seismological Bureau is working with the United Nations Office for Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Guo Xun, an experienced earthquake expert flew to Sri Lanka Monday to join a six-people United Nations evaluation team to investigate and develop a relief plan. "I will stay there for about 10 days and try to co-ordinate the rescue efforts from various countries in the fields of personnel and material aid," Guo told China Central Television Station at the airport. A team of more than 40 experts prepared to head to Indonesia for relief and rescue work, Xinhua said. "The task force is on all-weather condition, and will set off at the invitation of the Indonesian government," it quoted Huang Jianfa, an official with the bureau, as saying. The Foreign Ministry set up a hotline Monday, 86-10-65963511, to help the public track down relatives and friends in South and Southeast Asia. The hotline set up by Hong Kong authorities is (852) 2829 3010. Relief organizations in Hong Kong were also rallying efforts to dispatch emergency aid to the disaster-hit region while appealing for urgent donations. Four HK immigration officers arrived in Thailand\'s Phuket to help residents return. Airlines also got ready to schedule additional flights to airlift stranded citizens home. TIC Executive Director, Joseph Tung, said the council had contacted all travel agencies with groups in Phuket and was told their members were safe.He said the agencies were arranging for their return to Hong Kong. Meanwhile, relief organizations in the SAR Monday rushed to the aid of the victims in the disaster-struck countries. Oxfam Hong Kong said it had made an initial grant of HK$200,000 for emergency relief and rehabilitation work in Sri Lanka, one of the worst hit countries in the region. Relief workers from other Oxfam groups were already in Sri Lanka participating in the rescue. Yunnan quakes Zhang Xiaodong, an earthquake expert said the earthquake, measuring 8.7 on the Richter Scale, was the largest ever in the area. The resulting tsunami did not affect China. Southwest China\'s Yunnan Province was rattled by 47 tremors on Sunday and experts estimated that they were somehow related to the deadly earthquake. The National Tourism Administration said Monday travel agencies should be very cautious when arranging travel packages to Southeast Asian nations in the near future. Southeast Asian nations and regions that include Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Maldives are usually major offshore destinations for Chinese residents, especially during the coming lunar new year festival that begins on February 8. Flights between Guangdong Province and many Southeast Asian nations and regions have been operating normally in the past two days.\n\n\n\nClose Today\'s Top News Top China News Defence document warns separatists\n\nTsunami kills 22,477, Taiwan tourist dies\n\nIndian army chief visits China\n\nNine Vietnamese ships detained in Hainan\n\nRenminbi exchange rate kept stable\n\nGrowth leaves China high and dry\n\nIndian army chief visits China Renminbi exchange rate kept stable Defence document warns separatists Law to make officials \'take blame and quit\' Beijing seeks Olympic slogan China launches new generation Internet\n\nGo to Another Section select hot link News Center China World Business Life Sports Most Popular Photo Gallery Story Tools News Talk It is time to prepare for Beijing - 2008', 'title': 'Chinese missing as tsunami toll hits 24,000', 'url': 'http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-12/28/content_403729.htm', 'keywords': ['kong', 'chinese', 'maldives', 'china', 'relief', 'hits', 'nations', '24000', 'sri', 'tsunami', 'missing', 'toll', 'travel', 'hong'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Chinese missing as tsunami toll hits 24,000By Tonny Chan, Qin Jize, Zheng Caixiong (China Daily)Updated: 2004-12-28 01:20 Piling up the dead along the tropical coasts of southern Asia, rescuers counted the death toll to 24,000 Monday while China joined other nations in efforts to help nations hit by the quake and tsunami on Sunday.\nAs of Monday evening, 19 people from Hong Kong and six from the mainland had been admitted to hospitals in the tsunami-hit regions.\nThough two tourists from Zhejiang Province missing the day before were found alive Monday, a number of Chinese nationals remain missing in Thailand.\nSecretary for Security, Ambrose Lee, citing Hong Kong Travel Industry Council information, said over 1,000 Hong Kong people in 30 to 40 groups were in Phuket when the tsunami hit.\nLee admitted a number of Hong Kong people were still missing.', 'date': 1104192000}, {'text': 'Around a million are now homeless in Sri Lanka\n\nThe death toll is still climbing, thousands are missing and millions have been made homeless by the world\'s worst earthquake in 40 years.\n\nAt least 10 countries have been affected, with Sri Lanka, Indonesia, India and Thailand among the worst hit.\n\nInternational aid efforts have begun amid fears that disease could spread through the disaster zone.\n\nClick here for map of affected area\n\nSurvivors may have little clean water or sanitation after Sunday\'s 9.0 magnitude earthquake sent huge waves from Malaysia to Africa.\n\nDISASTER TOLL Sri Lanka: 13,000 dead Indonesia: 4,500 dead India: 3,500 dead Thailand: 866 dead Maldives: 52 dead Malaysia: 44 dead Burma: 30 dead Bangladesh: 2 dead\n\nEyewitness accounts In pictures: Quake disaster At-a-glance: Countries hit\n\nMany places are still affected by flooding and communications remain disrupted, with contact not yet made with some remote regions.\n\nThe United Nations says the international relief operation is likely to be the biggest in history.\n\nThough it was not the biggest tsunami wave ever recorded, "the effects may be the biggest ever because many more people live in exposed areas than ever before", said UN emergency relief co-ordinator Jan Egeland.\n\nHe said the relief operation would probably cost "many billions of dollars".\n\nDigging for the dead\n\nCommunities were swept away and homes engulfed by waves up to 10m high after the quake created a wall of water that sped across the oceans.\n\nThe number of dead has climbed well into the thousands in Sri Lanka, India and Indonesia, and thousands are feared to have been killed on the Andaman and Nicobar islands, where reports say several islands have been submerged.\n\nThe waves flattened entire areas\n\nEnlarge Image\n\n\n\nIn northern Indonesia, nearest to the epicentre of the undersea quake, the vice-president said he feared fatalities in the worst-hit province of Aceh could rise as high as 20,000.\n\nJusuf Kalla appealed for urgent international aid.\n\n"It\'s very, very bad," he told reporters after a trip to the area.

There is enough food to go around; it is just in the wrong places. The same can be said about natural disasters like the earthquake and tsunami that killed tens of thousands in Asia last week. People are in the wrong places.\n\nHuman decisions can limit the extent of the damage, something folks in the Bay Area know well from many years of preparing for the Big One.\n\nJust as people in the Bay Area have spent billions of dollars to limit the ill effects of a devastating quake, others around the world have done the same to prepare for their inevitable disasters.\n\nExperts know that such preparations make a difference in the human cost of disasters. They are already citing many things, small and large, that could be done to reduce deaths in the event of future quake-tsunami combos.\n\nWhy haven\'t they already taken the necessary steps? Some Asian countries are too poor perhaps, but what about India?\n\nThe world\'s second most populous nation has the money and know-how to build an arsenal of nuclear weapons and missiles to carry them hundreds of miles.\n\nIndia is also home to an enormous software industry. And yet the nation\'s hard-hit coast was unprotected even by a relatively inexpensive electronic warning system that could have saved thousands of lives.\n\nShame on India for failing to realize that its pell-mell rush to the forefront of the world\'s high-tech industries dangerously exposed it to an old- economy mishap.\n\nShame on India\'s government for pushing so hard to advance its nuclear weapons program that it failed to see the wisdom of stringing cheap sensors along its coastline. (Only now, after the disaster, do Indian leaders pledge to install a warning system.)\n\nIndia is not alone in deserving condemnation even as it "earns" aid and sympathy. Look at Indonesia. One of the areas most devastated by the disaster is Aceh province, home to some of the most productive oil fields in Asia and described last week as "a graveyard."\n\nBillions of dollars have been pumped out of Aceh in recent decades, with most of the money lining the pockets of Indonesia\'s elite. We know the people of Aceh aren\'t benefiting from oil much because for 25 years, Indonesia\'s central government has mounted a war to maintain its control over Aceh\'s oil.\n\nWithout the force of arms, Aceh would have seceded from Indonesia, or at least gained a fair split of its oil revenue.\n\nNo matter how the area\'s oil money had been spent, last week\'s disaster would have killed many in Aceh. But had more money been spent on Aceh\'s infrastructure and its people, surely the death toll would have been lower.\n\nIn the rush to help survivors, humanitarian agencies aren\'t blameless either. They are sending the wrong message to the shortsighted leaders who helped to make the disaster such a horror in the first place.\n\nOf course, relief workers and donors are obligated to help the needy. Still, they can come clean with the rest of us and state the obvious: They are rewarding irresponsible governments for doing nothing.\n\nSuch a declaration, of course, would harm the fund-raising capabilities of Oxfam, Catholic Relief Services and the Red Cross, to name a few of the prominent relief outfits.

[Reuters] The disaster spared no one. Western tourists were killed sunbathing on beaches, poor villagers drowned in homes by the sea and fishermen died in flimsy boats. The 21-year-old grandson of Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej was killed on a jet-ski. "We have a long way to go in collecting bodies," said Thailand\'s Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who expected the 866 death toll in his country to go much higher. One Thai official estimated up to 30 percent of the dead were foreigners. Sri Lanka was hardest hit by the tsunami -- a wall of water triggered by the world\'s biggest earthquake in 40 years with a magnitude of 9.0 that erupted off the northern Indonesian coast. Colombo officials said their latest death toll had nearly doubled to 10,200 and 200 foreign tourists were feared dead. "It smells so bad ... The human bodies are mixed in with dead animals like dogs, fish, cats and goats," said Marine Colonel Buyung Lelana, head of an evacuation team in Indonesia\'s Aceh province on the island of Sumatra. Families around the world anxiously sought news of loved ones on Christmas holidays whose dreams of sunshine in the east were turned into scenes of disaster. Calls from worried relatives swamped hotlines set up by ministries and tour firms. "Our paradise turned into hell," said American tourist Moira Lee, 28, who was on Patong Beach in Phuket, Thailand. With at least seven Asian nations and one in East Africa counting the human and economic cost of the tragedy, Western nations pledged aid and geologists asked why warning systems that could have saved thousands of lives were not in place. Struggling with destroyed communications, power outages and swamped and debris-strewn roads, emergency workers were shocked by the sheer scale of the catastrophe. "We are used to dealing with disasters in one country. But I think something like this spread across many countries and islands is unprecedented. We have not had this before," Yvette Stevens, a U.N. emergency relief official, said in Geneva. BODIES IN TREES, MAKESHIFT MORGUES Other areas worst affected by Sunday\'s tsunami were southern India, where more than 6,600 were listed dead, northern Indonesia with nearly 5,000 drowned and Thailand\'s devastated southern tourist isles and beaches. Deaths were also reported in Bangladesh, Malaysia, the Maldives, Myanmar and distant Somalia where 38 people were killed by swollen seas. The earthquake triggered a tsunami of up to 33 feet high, sometimes traveling as fast as an airliner, flattening houses, hurling fishing boats onto roads, sending cars spinning through swirling waters into hotel lobbies and sucking sunbathers, babies and fishermen out to sea. Hundreds of thousands were left homeless. Smaller tremors followed Sunday\'s earthquake, the world\'s biggest since 1964 and the fourth-largest since 1900. The tsunami had echoes of another apocalyptic seismic event that originated in Indonesia when the island volcano of Krakatoa erupted in 1883 causing a tsunami that killed 36,000 people. Indonesian rescue workers pulled hundreds of bodies from treetops, rivers and wrecked homes in Aceh province, desperate to clean up before disease could spread from rotting bodies polluting water supplies. Volunteers laid children\'s bodies in rows under sarongs at makeshift morgues. Others were stacked in white fish crates. "I am hoping there are still enough coffins available," said Mustofa, mayor of Aceh\'s Bireuen regency. One senior official said the toll in Aceh province could rise to 10,000. Deaths were previously put at 3,000. In Banda Aceh, capital of Aceh near the quake\'s epicenter, troops were unloading piles of bodies from military trucks on Monday after the tsunami swept several kilometers inland. In the center of the sprawling city, dozens of bodies were scattered on streets, while masses of debris -- a mix of mud, ruined trucks and cars, mangled motorcycles and wood from shattered houses -- had yet to be cleared. Throughout the region, relatives hunted through piles of dead stacked up in hospital corridors and prayed for the safe return of thousands still missing. Some pinned up photographs to try to track down the missing. DEATH CAME FROM THE SEA "Death came from the sea," Satya Kumari, a construction worker living on the outskirts of Pondicherry, India, told Reuters. "The waves just kept chasing us. It swept away all our huts. What did we do to deserve this?" Among those killed in Sri Lanka were at least nine Japanese tourists who had been watching elephants in a park when the tsunami swept over them. "The scale of the tragedy is massive ... this is a grave tragedy which we have not been prepared for," President Chandrika Kumaratunga told the BBC. Hundreds of thousands in Sri Lanka left homeless and fearing another wave sheltered in temples and schools. Weeping relatives scrambled over hundreds of bodies piled in a hospital in nearby Karapitiya, shirts or handkerchiefs clutched over their noses against the stench of decaying flesh. "We are struggling to cope. Bodies are still coming in," said Dr H.G. Jayaratne of Karapitiya Teaching Hospital. Hundreds of corpses lay bloated and disfigured throughout the lobby and corridors of the hospital. Thailand evacuated injured survivors from its southern beaches Monday. Britons, Danes, Swedes, Swiss, Australians, Italians and at least one New Zealander and an American were among the dead on Phuket, where at least 130 people were killed. Diplomats from 28 countries arrived on the resort island to help the survivors. On Phuket\'s Patong beach, hotels and restaurants were wrecked and speed boats rammed into buildings. Many foreign tourists, some evacuated in bathing costumes, were left destitute, possessions and passports lost to the sea. Among the missing in India were 200 Hindu pilgrims who went for a ritual sea bath. Hundreds scattered petals on the water and sacrificed chickens to pray for their loved ones\' return. Iran Monday sent condolences to Asian countries struck by a tsunami a year to the day after an earthquake killed 31,000 people in the Iranian city of Bam.\n\n\n\nClose Today\'s Top News Top World News Defence document warns separatists\n\nChinese missing as tsunami toll hits 24,000\n\nIndian army chief visits China\n\nNine Vietnamese ships detained in Hainan\n\nRenminbi exchange rate kept stable\n\nGrowth leaves China high and dry\n\nBodies piled on coasts after tsunami kills 22,700 Asia tsunami kills 15,500, rush to find bodies Yushchenko wins Ukraine presidency Suicide bomber kills 9, wounds 39 in Iraq UN warns of possible epidemics in quake-hit Asia Israel starts Palestinian prisoner release\n\nGo to Another Section select hot link News Center China World Business Life Sports Most Popular Photo Gallery Story Tools News Talk Are the Republicans exploiting the memory of 9/11?', 'title': 'Bodies piled on coasts after tsunami kills 22,700', 'url': 'http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-12/28/content_403732.htm', 'keywords': ['bodies', 'kills', 'hundreds', '22700', 'coasts', 'tsunami', 'killed', 'tourists', 'dead', 'aceh', 'missing', 'toll', 'piled', 'sea'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Bodies piled on coasts after tsunami kills 22,700(Agenceis)Updated: 2004-12-28 02:03 Rescuers scoured the sea for missing tourists and fishermen in Asia Monday and fears of disease grew as emergency services struggled with rotting bodies from a devastating tsunami that killed more than 22,700 people.\nAn Acehnese woman walks past dead bodies in the Indonesian city of Banda Aceh December 27, 2004.\nColombo officials said their latest death toll had nearly doubled to 10,200 and 200 foreign tourists were feared dead.\nThe tsunami had echoes of another apocalyptic seismic event that originated in Indonesia when the island volcano of Krakatoa erupted in 1883 causing a tsunami that killed 36,000 people.\nWeeping relatives scrambled over hundreds of bodies piled in a hospital in nearby Karapitiya, shirts or handkerchiefs clutched over their noses against the stench of decaying flesh.', 'date': 1104192000}, {'text': 'Leonid Ragozin\n\nBBCRussian.com\n\n\n\nIndonesia is one of the world\'s most active volcanic zones\n\nEarthquake zones and volcanoes are located close to one another, so fears persist that a volcanic eruption could be a possibility.\n\nBut experts say there is no hard evidence that earthquakes trigger volcanic eruptions.\n\nEven if there were a link, scientists say, the epicentre of the earthquake - although lying relatively close to active volcanoes of the Indonesian archipelago - is still too far away and too close to the surface to cause spark an eruption.\n\nThere is a history of disastrous eruptions in Indonesia, including the one that destroyed the cone of the Krakatoa volcano and caused a tsunami wave that killed at least 34,000 people in 1883.\n\nIt also emitted large quantities of ash and gas that caused a handful of harsh winters around the globe.\n\nBut scientists studying earthquakes in the Pacific believe there is no firm connection between such events and increases in volcanic activity.\n\nKuril wave\n\nA disaster very similar to the Asian tsunami occurred on the Russian Pacific coast in 1952.

Millions remained homeless. A boat lies in a road in Victoria town, Mah Island in the Seychelles, following surges in the water level after an earthquake off the Indonesian island of Sumatra sent devastating tsunami waves across the Indian ocean on Sunday, in this photograph taken on December 27, 2004. [Reuters] Rescuers struggled to reach remote locations where thousands more were likely killed by the deadliest tsunami in 120 years. Bodies, many of them children, filled beaches and choked hospital morgues, raising fears of disease across the region. Sri Lanka raised its death toll past 18,700. Hundreds died when a train carrying 1,000 passengers from Colombo to Galle was thrown off its tracks by Sunday\'s waves, police chief B.T.B. Ariyapala said Tuesday. The waves wrenched most of the train\'s cars into twisted metal, he said. The passengers were dead or missing; about 150 bodies had been recovered. In Indonesia, the country closest to Sunday\'s 9.0 magnitude quake that sent walls of water crashing into coastlines thousands of miles away, the count rose to 15,000, a number the vice president said could rise. Purnomo Sidik, the national disaster director, told The Associated Press the toll rose by almost 10,000 people after the government received reports from the previously unreachable western coast of Sumatra. Some 4,400 died in India; 1,500 perished in Thailand. The Red Cross said malaria and cholera could add to the toll. Desperate residents on Indonesia\'s Sumatra Island ― 100 miles from the quake\'s epicenter ― looted stores Tuesday. "There is no help, it is each person for themselves here," district official Tengku Zulkarnain told el-Shinta radio station. The disaster could be the costliest in history, with "many billions of dollars" of damage, said U.N. Undersecretary Jan Egeland, who is in charge of emergency relief coordination. Hundreds of thousands lost all they owned, he said. In Galle, Sri Lanka, officials used a loudspeaker atop a fire engine to tell residents to place bodies on the road for collection. Muslim families used cooking utensils and even their bare hands to dig graves. Hindus in India, abandoning their tradition of burning bodies, held mass burials. Soldiers and volunteers in Indonesia combed through destroyed houses to try to find survivors ― or bodies. The toll in Thailand included at least 700 foreign tourists. Stories of survival emerged amid the devastation. A blond-haired 2-year-old found sitting alone on a road in Thailand and taken to a hospital was reunited with his uncle, who saw the boy\'s picture on the hospital\'s Web site. "When I saw Hannes on the Internet, I booked an air ticket to come here in less than five hours," said a man who identified himself only as Jim. Hannes Bergstroem\'s mother died in the tsunami; his father was in another hospital, the Swedish paper Aftonbladet reported. In Malaysia, a 20-day-old baby was found floating on a mattress soon after the waves hit Sunday. She and her family were reunited. But the geographic scope of the disaster was unparalleled. Relief organizations used to dealing with a centralized crisis had to distribute resources over 11 countries on two continents. Helicopters in India rushed medicine to stricken areas. In Sri Lanka, the Health Ministry dispatched 300 physicians to the disaster zone by helicopter. Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar said the United States was sending helicopters. An airborne surgical hospital from Finland arrived, and a German aircraft was en route with a water purification plant. UNICEF officials said about 175 tons of rice arrived in Banda Aceh, Indonesia, and six tons of medical supplies were to arrive by Thursday. But most basic supplies were scarce. A new danger emerged Tuesday: UNICEF said uprooted land mines in Sri Lanka threatened to kill or maim aid workers and survivors. "Mines were ... washed out of known mine fields, so now we don\'t know where they are," said Ted Chaiban, the Sri Lanka chief of UNICEF. Scores of people were also killed in Malaysia, Myanmar, Bangladesh, and Maldives. Deaths were even reported in Africa ― in Somalia, Tanzania and Seychelles, close to 3,000 miles away. On the remote Indian islands of Andaman and Nicobar, off the northern tip of Sumatra, officials still hadn\'t established communications. An estimated 3,000 deaths there were not counted in the official toll. It was the deadliest known tsunami since the one caused by the 1883 volcanic eruption at Krakatoa ― located off Sumatra\'s southern tip ― which killed an estimated 36,000 people. Many of the dead and missing were children ― as many as half the victims in Sri Lanka. "Where are my children?" asked 41-year-old Absah, as she searched for her 11 youngsters in Banda Aceh, the city closest to Sunday\'s epicenter. "Where are they? Why did this happen to me? I\'ve lost everything." The streets in Banda Aceh were filled with overturned cars and rotting corpses. Shopping malls and office buildings lay in rubble, and thousands of homeless families huddled in mosques and schools. Relatives wandered hallways lined with bodies at the hospital in Sri Lanka\'s southern town of Galle, a stunned hush broken only by wails of mourning. Momentum grew to create a tsunami warning system like the one that guards Pacific coasts. Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Australia would push for its creation.\n\nVideo grab shows a tidal wave in Penang after tsunami waves hit southern Asia on Sunday in this amateur video footage taken December 26, 2004. [Reuters] "I know it looks like a bit like closing the door after the horse has bolted," Downer said Tuesday. But he said he hoped such a system would save lives in the future. The United States dispatched disaster teams and prepared a $15 million aid package. Japan pledged $30 million and Australia $8 million. Indonesia\'s Aceh province exemplified the challenge to aid workers. The government until Monday barred foreigners because of a separatist conflict. Communications lines were still down and remote villages had yet to be reached. "There is not anyone to bury the bodies," said Steve Aswin, a UNICEF official in Jakarta. "They should be buried in mass graves but there is no one to dig graves." Sri Lankan police waived the law calling for mandatory autopsies, allowing rotting corpses to be buried immediately. "We accept that the deaths were caused by drowning," police spokesman Rienzie Perera said. India on Tuesday said a nuclear power plant damaged by tidal waves was safe and that there was no threat of radiation.\n\n\n\n\n\nClose Today\'s Top News Top World News White Paper: Strong army ensures China unity\n\nTidal waves death toll rises to 40,000\n\nRussia, China to hold massive joint drill\n\n\'Chinese Hacker\' defaces McDonald\'s website\n\nWatchdog to tighten control on flight safety\n\nPowell, White House hail Ukraine election\n\nTidal waves death toll rises to 40,000 Ukraine PM returns to work after election setback Rebels strike Iraqi forces after bin Laden call US presses for Sunnis in Iraq election Powell, White House hail Ukraine election France apartment building blast kills 17\n\nAdvertisement', 'title': 'Tidal waves death toll rises to 40,000', 'url': 'http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-12/28/content_404037.htm', 'keywords': ['disaster', 'hospital', 'tidal', 'bodies', 'lanka', 'sri', 'tsunami', 'aceh', 'toll', 'rises', 'death', 'waves', '40000'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': "Tidal waves death toll rises to 40,000(Agencies)Updated: 2004-12-28 21:19 BANDA ACEH, Indonesia - The death toll from the epic tsunami that rocked 11 countries rose to 40,000 people Tuesday, and food and supplies poured into the region, part of what the U.N. said would be the biggest relief effort the world has ever seen.\nSri Lanka raised its death toll past 18,700.\nA new danger emerged Tuesday: UNICEF said uprooted land mines in Sri Lanka threatened to kill or maim aid workers and survivors.\nVideo grab shows a tidal wave in Penang after tsunami waves hit southern Asia on Sunday in this amateur video footage taken December 26, 2004.\nClose Today's Top News Top World News White Paper: Strong army ensures China unityTidal waves death toll rises to 40,000Russia, China to hold massive joint drill'Chinese Hacker' defaces McDonald's websiteWatchdog to tighten control on flight safetyPowell, White House hail Ukraine electionTidal waves death toll rises to 40,000 Ukraine PM returns to work after election setback Rebels strike Iraqi forces after bin Laden call US presses for Sunnis in Iraq election Powell, White House hail Ukraine election France apartment building blast kills 17Advertisement", 'date': 1104192000}, {'text': 'U.N.: Tsunami damage \'unprecedented\'\n\nEmergency relief head calls on nations to step up aid\n\n\n\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- The United Nations\' emergency relief head called the tsunamis that devastated large parts of southern Asia "unprecedented," and warned Monday that it may be weeks before the full effects are known.\n\nThe tsunamis were "not the biggest in recorded history, but the effects may be the biggest ever because many more people live in exposed areas than ever before," said Jan Egeland, undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief.\n\nWith tens of thousands dead, many missing and millions displaced, still more serious problems lie ahead, Egeland said, including widespread illnesses. And it could take years to rebuild places that were wiped out, he said.\n\nMonday afternoon, he said relief efforts were under way.\n\n"A lot of airplanes are already being loaded. Some are already airborne and going to the hardest-hit countries, like Sri Lanka," he said, adding that experts had arrived in Sri Lanka and the Maldives.

"I don\'t think that is very generous."\n\nThe U.S. government expects to spend $15 million in its initial response to the disaster, the State Department said Monday. The United States\' overall foreign aid commitment is around 0.2 percent of its gross national product. (Full story)\n\nThe Congressional Research Service at the Library of Congress, in an April report to lawmakers, said total foreign assistance -- excluding the costs of reconstruction in Iraq after the U.S.-led invasion -- was larger in the 2003 and 2004 budgets than in any two-year period since the mid-1980s.\n\n"The 0.2 percent of U.S. gross national product represented by foreign aid obligations the past two years, however, is among the smallest amounts in the last half-century. The United States is the largest international economic aid donor in dollar terms but is the smallest contributor among the major donor governments when calculated as a percent of gross national income," said the report, which is posted on the U.S. State Department\'s Web site.\n\nAt a White House briefing Monday in Crawford, Texas, CNN asked spokesman Trent Duffy about the "stingy" remark. He said he thinks the United States is "the largest contributor to international relief and aid efforts not only through the government, but through charitable organizations. The American people are very giving, so we\'ll continue to be that and we\'ll be a leading partner in this effort that lies ahead."\n\nEgeland, at the U.N. news conference, said the cost of the devastation will "probably be many billions of dollars. However, we cannot fathom the cost of these poor societies and the nameless fishermen and fishing villages that have just been wiped out."\n\n"The important thing is that we give and that we as citizens also demand that our countries give generously to those who have been so hard hit."\n\nThe tsunamis were triggered by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake, and Egeland said the quake struck less than an hour before Sumatra was hit by the waves.

Indonesia reported more than 4,000 new deaths on Friday, pushing the overall toll to about 145,000. Even as more deaths from the initial effects of the natural disaster were announced, health officials warned that secondary deaths from hunger or disease would push the toll higher without a steady supply of aid to the region. Local resident Hassan Pootpong, 54, walks through the destroyed streets of the Thai resort island of Koh Phi Phi, January 7, 2005. Hundreds of people died on the island after it was hit by a tsunami on December 26. [Reuters] Donors concluded an emergency summit Thursday as relief workers scrambled to move aid to areas of Sumatra, the Indonesian island hit hardest by the earthquake and giant waves that crashed ashore Dec. 26. Volunteers hurled sacks of rice and instant noodles into trucks as U.S. helicopters loaded with other supplies buzzed overhead en route to isolated communities. A new potential danger emerged, this time to the American and Australian military teams assisting the tsunami survivors. A radical Islamic group once headed by an al-Qaida-linked terror chief set up a relief camp in Sumatra. The militants, known for attacking Christians on Indonesia\'s far-flung islands, insisted they would not interfere with foreign troops ― so long as they kept to humanitarian operations. Indonesia on Friday said its death toll from the 9.0-magnitude earthquake and the tsunamis it spawned was 98,489. More than 10,000 are still missing in the Aceh province of Sumatra island, the Ministry of Social Affairs said. The government at first raised its toll to 113,306 but scaled it back a short time later, blaming the inaccuracy on poor radio links. In the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, world leaders discussed how to transform one of the largest aid packages ever assembled ― nearly $4 billion in pledges ― into food for the hungry and shelter for the homeless. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged nations to come forward immediately with the billions they\'ve promised and to break with past practices of promising much and delivering little. "The disaster was so brutal, so quick, and so far-reaching, that we are still struggling to comprehend it," Annan said. "We will never know the exact magnitude of how many men, women and children perished on 26 December." On Friday, Annan traveled to Indonesia\'s tsunami-ravaged Aceh province to witness the devastation firsthand and the U.N. relief effort that is channeling relief. He was scheduled to take a helicopter ride over the devastated west coast of Sumatra island and then drive through the provincial capital, Banda Aceh. Australia leads the world with a total aid pledge of $810 million, followed by Germany, Japan and the United States. Secretary of State Colin Powell said America would take a wait-and-see attitude before pledging more cash. "These are not insignificant numbers," Powell told reporters. Japan hinted it might offer more help for those hit in the disaster that ravaged 11 countries ― including Sri Lanka, India and Thailand. Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura said the $500 million Japan already pledged "was on the small side." The World Health Organization said that if basic needs ― particularly access to safe drinking water ― were not restored by week\'s end, infectious diseases could kill tens of thousands. U.N. humanitarian chief Jan Egeland said hundreds of thousands of survivors who fled the coast in Sumatra could be living in around 200 makeshift camps in the forests and the hills. Until they are interviewed about missing friends and relatives, he said, the true death toll would not be known. "I think we have to be aware that very, very many of the victims have been swept away and many, many will not reappear," Egeland said. Epidemics could claim many more lives. "We now estimate that as many as 150,000 people are at extreme risk if a major disease outbreak in the affected areas occurs," said WHO Director-General Dr. Lee Jong-wook. For the moment, though, the threat of an outbreak of waterborne disease is being held in check by medical aid flooding into the region, U.N. officials said. While there are cases of diarrhea, respiratory and skin diseases and mental trauma, there have been no major outbreaks of disease in Sumatra\'s devastated Aceh region, the U.N. health agency said. But officials are concerned that unless this aid is sustained, the system could collapse. Getting water purification tablets to survivors and building rudimentary toilets remain the focus of efforts to fend off disease. The U.N. health organization is warning that hygiene in many of the hundreds of refugee camps that have sprung up around the region is the biggest disease concern. An estimated 3 million to 5 million people are living in refugee camps across the tsunami-stricken area. Leaders at the summit also discussed a tsunami warning system ― like one in place in the Pacific. The closing declaration called for the warning system to be set up, but gave few details. The summit gave the United Nations overall control of coordinating the relief effort, but the U.N. official in charge on Sumatra complained that the U.S. military was failing to work with relief organizations. Michael Elmquist said that while U.S. military helicopters were speeding relief supplies to isolated villages, their crews were not spending enough time on the ground to assess survivors\' needs. "They don\'t stop their engines. They\'re on the ground for five minutes," Elmquist told reporters in the provincial capital of Banda Aceh, on the northern tip of Sumatra. The U.S. relief operation has won praise for reaching villages devastated by the earthquake and tsunami, which washed out roads and destroyed bridges. But Elmquist said he couldn\'t be sure what supplies the helicopters were delivering. There was no immediate comment from the military. The Americans have been greeted by thankful villagers wherever their helicopters have landed. Around Banda Aceh, aid workers, their faces covered with masks to try to ward off the stench of rotting corpses, picked up bodies and dumped them in trucks bound for mass graves. Many bodies are being buried without being identified or counted. On some houses, signs say, "There are bodies;" in other places, arrows point to where corpses were buried under rubble.\n\n\n\nClose Today\'s Top News Top World News Asia tsunami death toll passes 150,000\n\nIndonesia praises Chinese aid, commitment\n\nUS relaxes visa requirements for biz, tourism\n\nKoizumi\'s party calls for continued shrine visit\n\nBeijing population tops 15 million\n\nNo change for residential power prices\n\nDeath toll from tsunami climbs to 147,000 7,000 more bodies discovered in Indonesia Italy train crash kills about 10 - Police Eight die, 240 hurt in US train crash Annan horrified by destruction Iraq\'s Allawi warns of more violence\n\nGo to Another Section select hot link News Center China World Business Life Sports Most Popular Photo Gallery Story Tools News Talk Are the Republicans exploiting the memory of 9/11?', 'title': 'Tsunami death toll rises to 145,000', 'url': 'http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-01/07/content_406951.htm', 'keywords': ['island', 'relief', '145000', 'disease', 'aid', 'sumatra', 'tsunami', 'aceh', 'toll', 'rises', 'world', 'death', 'survivors'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': "Tsunami death toll rises to 145,000(Agencies)Updated: 2005-01-07 14:15 World leaders wrapped up a one-day summit on Asia's earthquake and tsunamis, hoping to find the best way to help victims ― and to prevent such a catastrophe from happening again.\nA new potential danger emerged, this time to the American and Australian military teams assisting the tsunami survivors.\nIndonesia on Friday said its death toll from the 9.0-magnitude earthquake and the tsunamis it spawned was 98,489.\nMore than 10,000 are still missing in the Aceh province of Sumatra island, the Ministry of Social Affairs said.\nUntil they are interviewed about missing friends and relatives, he said, the true death toll would not be known.", 'date': 1105056000}, {'text': 'Five-metre waves swept up to 100 tourists into the sea on Thailand\'s most popular tourist island, Phuket, at the resorts of Patong, Karon and Kata. Another 100 tourists on diving holidays on islands off southern Thailand were missing, about 70 of them in the famed Emeral Cave. "We don\'t know whether they are dead or alive," an official said. The official death toll in Thailand was 223 last night, with 2000 injured. "Nothing like this has ever happened in our country before," said the Prime Minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, who ordered the evacuation of provinces in the south.\n\nBut the worst hit was Sri Lanka, 1600 kilometres to the west of the epicentre - because the tsunami had more time to gather strength before hitting land. The death toll stood at 4150, according to police and Tamil Tiger sources quoted by AP, with 1 million more affected, about 5 per cent of the population. "I think this is the worst ever natural disaster in Sri Lanka," said the National Disaster Management Centre.\n\nSri Lanka\'s President declared a national disaster as thousands fled the coast. A spokesman for the Sri Lankan military said half the navy\'s eastern fleet was looking for survivors. The navy said its base at Trincomalee, on the north-eastern coast, was under water. In southern India the toll was more than 2000, with 1625 killed in the state of Tamil Nadu alone, more than 100 of which were in Chennai. The city\'s police chief said: "The bodies in the hospital are mostly young women and children."\n\nFour-hundred fishermen were also reported missing. The death toll in Indonesia was put at 1902, with the province of Aceh, on the north-western tip of Sumatra, bearing the brunt. Entire villages and towns were swept away and thousands were scrambling for higher ground. On the island of Nias, a surfing mecca for Australians off Sumatra\'s west coast, 75 bodies had been recovered.\n\nAn Australian boat captain, Edward Shiels, who was on the coast of Sumatra when the earthquake hit, told Channel Seven last night: "Basically the waters just drained out of the bay." In Malaysia 29 people were killed, 21 of them in the popular tourist island of Penang. The number of dead was climbing rapidly last night as reports from remote areas came in.\n\nIn the Maldives two-thirds of the capital, Male, was under water. Much of the Maldives, a string of 1192 coral atolls off the south-western coast of India, was inundated. A spokesman for the Maldives Government, Ahmed Shaheed, said: "The damage is considerable. [Male] is only about three feet above sea level and a wave of water four feet high swept over us." There were no reports of Australian casualties, but Australian diplomatic staff in Thailand, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and India were calling hotels and hospitals in areas where Australians were believed to be staying. A spokesman for the Foreign Affairs Department said its staff in Bangkok, Jakarta, New Delhi and Colombo were taking urgent steps to locate Australians.\n\nA West Australian state MP, John Hyde, on Phuket, told ABC television: "Suddenly the streets are awash and people just running and screaming from the beach. And all the windows are blown in everywhere." Another Australian, Simon Morse, was in a Phuket pub watching the cricket when it hit. "People were getting swept along still on their motorbikes on their sides. There were cars that had been picked up by the storm surge and they were getting pushed down the road." It is peak tourist season in Thailand, and the rest of South-East Asia, and the resorts were booked solid for Christmas.\n\nA geophysicist, Julie Martinez, said of the quake: "We\'ve just updated it to 8.9 magnitude [from 8.5]. That makes it the fifth largest earthquake since 1900." In Aceh panic-stricken people were jolted awake at 6.30am local time. "The ground was shaking for a long time," said a witness, Yayan Zamzani.\n\nExperts said last night the earthquake could have been triggered by a tremor that struck 800 kilometres south of Tasmania on Christmas Eve. A spokesman for Geoscience Australia, Cvetan Sinadinovski, said Australia and Indonesia were connected by the Indo-Australian tectonic plate, and "the release of energy on one side of the plate could cause a release of energy on the other side". Dr Roger Musson, a seismologist with the British Geological Survey in Edinburgh, said the quake was caused by one of the plates which makes up the world\'s surface moving a matter of metres.\n\nHe said the fault line running under the Indian Ocean was 1200km long, 500km wide and in three sections, and that it had moved just 15 metres. Dr Musson explained: "It happened because of the fact that the whole of the Indian-Australian plate is moving northwards. This will happen again in the future over the next several million years and has been happening for several million years in the past."\n\nHe said the fault under the Indian Ocean was much bigger than the San Andreas fault in California. "The San Andreas fault is more or less vertical so no matter how long it is it can only go about 30km down because that is the width of the crust. "But this thing is dipping gradually so is probably 500km wide as well as several thousand km long in total, so it\'s got much more potential for big earthquakes than the San Andreas has.', 'title': "Tsunami's ring of death", 'url': 'https://www.smh.com.au/world/tsunamis-ring-of-death-20041227-gdkdz5.html', 'keywords': ['swept', 'fault', 'ring', 'sri', 'coast', 'tsunamis', 'thailand', 'australian', 'spokesman', 'toll', 'night', 'death', 'long'], 'tags': {'Column 8', 'Socceroos', 'Good Weekend', 'Quizzes', 'Horoscopes', 'Letters', 'For subscribers', 'Editorial', 'Obituaries'}, 'summary': 'The official death toll in Thailand was 223 last night, with 2000 injured.\nThe death toll stood at 4150, according to police and Tamil Tiger sources quoted by AP, with 1 million more affected, about 5 per cent of the population.\n"I think this is the worst ever natural disaster in Sri Lanka," said the National Disaster Management Centre.\nA spokesman for the Sri Lankan military said half the navy\'s eastern fleet was looking for survivors.\nThe death toll in Indonesia was put at 1902, with the province of Aceh, on the north-western tip of Sumatra, bearing the brunt.', 'date': 1104105600}, {'text': 'World\'s biggest earthquake in almost four years registered off Australia\n\n(Agencies)\n\nUpdated: 2004-12-24 15:40\n\nThe world\'s biggest earthquake in almost four years, measuring 8.1 on the Richter scale, struck off the coast of Australia\'s southern island state of Tasmania, but caused no damage or injury.\n\nSeismological officials said it was felt throughout Tasmania and the South Island of New Zealand, but because it occurred at a depth of 10 kilometres (6.25 miles) and far from inhabited land, it was barely noticed even by the scientists or penguins on nearby Macquarie Islands.\n\n\n\nEarthquake recorded on a seismograph.

I have spent the last 10 days delivering aid to affected parts of Sri Lanka, including Unawatuna and the North East Trincomalee and Keeniya. My friend and I tried to work with the Red Cross and UN but had very little joy and ended up doing it all ourselves using local contacts. In total we helped about 1500 families with basic provisions, such as food, water, sleeping mats, baby food, lamps etc.\n\nMatt Bennett, London I was horrified to hear of the tsunami on Boxing Day. I have visited the Maldives - Reethi Beech - only in June 2003. It was a lovely beautiful tranquil place. I know the island itself is ok - but I hope that all the holidaymakers and staff are ok as well as their families. I went to a fishing village whilst in the Maldives but I am unable to find out whether the island is ok. I pray that it is.\n\nNina, Northants, England There were 9 of us (6 grown-ups and 3 small children) on our way to Poda Island where we planned to sun-bath on the beach and do some snorkelling. We saw the wave coming, though did not realize it was so high until it was quite near us. We turned back to Ao Nang, but were hit by the wave shortly after. All of us managed to get back to the shore and were there helped out of the water by some Thai men and tourists (Australians I think). We are very thankful for your help! We could have not managed it without you helping us out while risking your own lives! Thank you very much.\n\nEwa Kloskowska, Ao Nang At 7.30 that morning vibrations were felt by some, but nothing was really thought of it. By 10.30am the tsunamis hit our island of Olhuveli, Maldives. We had seconds to react, the wave was so powerful. Whizzing past me was bedroom furniture, TVs, fridges. We had to fight for our lives. The experience was terrifying. I never thought we were going to get of the island alive. The whole island was destroyed. The devastation was immense. The fear, people screaming and blood everywhere, will stay with me for a long time. I lost everything but I am so grateful for my life. I have an overwhelming feeling of sadness that is constantly with me, and this is for the people that really have lost everything. I think about the islanders and what wonderful people they are. I have thought of going back there to help them try and rebuild their island. God bless them all.\n\nRita Davie, Bexleyheath, Kent, UK I am a teacher in Phuket. I drove inland as the first wave hit the island. The earth tremor we felt was big, but we just couldn\'t work out what it was. An earthquake was the last thing we could imagine. So we just continued as usual, packing up to go on a New Year holiday on the Gulf of Thailand. I\'m one of the lucky ones. This has been the worst experience of my life. I drove through Khao Lak on Monday and felt tranquilised, as if it was all a very weird, scary dream. The images and smells will not leave me. One feels so overwhelmed when faced with such devastation. Where do you begin? How do you help? You feel helpless and guilty for being alive and unharmed. We have decided to help the children. Our school is sponsoring another school demolished in the Patong disaster. We are helping with books, stationery, food and clothing. And of course, moral support. Ordinary individuals are performing heroic tasks, swallowing their own loss and sadness, to help others.\n\nJustine, Phuket, Thailand On 26 December, I felt the earth shake at 6.30am. I live in Tiruvanmiyur, Madras about 500 metres from the sea. I was sitting in a chair in my room when the ground started shaking. My ears were blocked and I couldn\'t breathe. The windows started rattling. I asked my Dad to open the gates as I didn\'t know what was happening. It was very early and no one was on the streets. We were too shocked and surprised and we did not know what to do. We went to church and returned at noon. The beach was crowded with people who had come to see the water which had covered the beach. It was a miracle that we were saved. We did not know about tsunamis and had no idea that the earthquake had hit Indonesia. We were celebrating Christmas with cakes and church service. I was so afraid that I could not sleep for days as we did not know if the tsunami would hit our beach again. I am still too frightened to go to the beach. It is not safe any more. This is the second time we have experienced earthquakes. Please advise if we should leave our homes and move to a safer place. Jenny\n\nJenny Lawrence, Madras, India Death was very close\n\nRifat Jalal Khan, Karachi, Pakistan I had been spending holidays with my family in Phuket, Thailand. It was a Sunday morning and we were staying in a beach front resort at the Patong Beach when I woke up feeling tremors followed by huge walls of water that struck the beach after a little while. It was a horrific experience as I along with my family ran for our lives to the hotel\'s roof top. It was as close a call as I had experienced. Death was very close.\n\nRifat Jalal Khan, Karachi, Pakistan I was probably 2000 km away from Aceh when the tsunami disaster happened, but my older brother was right there in Banda Aceh. We couldn\'t contact him for more than two days. Several friends of him who managed to escape to Medan even told my mother that he might not had survived. I am lucky enough to have my brother back at home right now, but many of my other friends weren\'t as lucky as me. Many of their relatives in Aceh remains unable to be contacted till now. At the time the tsunami struck Banda Aceh, my brother witnessed water coming from two sides of the road, and he saw water spilling over a 1.5 meter fence of wall. Main streets was filled by cars, motors, and people running to the same direction: away from the water. Although the waves didn\'t destroy his house, he saw a small pile of dead bodies next to it. He retreated to a higher place together with his friend and many other refugees. Local police worked 24 hours per-day evacuating people to refugee camps. At Wednesday he managed to travel to Lhokseumawe and then to Medan by bus, which took more than one day. Usually it takes less than half a day on normal condition. He also said the earthquake was big too, people couldn\'t stand still unless they hold on to something, like my brother who hold on to a coconut tree.\n\nIrfansyah, Yogyakarta, Indonesia I was lucky enough to escape the disaster, being on a boat just off Ko Phi Phi when it hit. I have since been volunteering at Krabi hospital and Khao Lak Temple (makeshift morgue). The sites that i and other tourist volunteers have seen are horrific but at least we can all go back to a nice comfortable life in our own countries. There are many refugees in Thailand and I\'m sure a load more in Indonesia and Sri Lanka that don\'t have this luxury. If you have the financial capacity to donate towards their cause please do as I\'ve seen the destruction first hand and take it from me, they need the help.\n\nAdam, Hertfordshire, England My family and I were in Sri Lanka, staying in Galle. Our villa was in the fort and so we were protected when the wave came. Initially we thought it was just a flood as some of the streets of the fort were rivers of sea water and the power had gone. Only later we observed the destruction in Galle town from the ramparts of the fort. The cricket pitch was completely flooded and on it was a bus and a 40ft freight container. The coastline was simply rubble where houses had stood before. People were milling around without purpose; many had lost absolutely everything including their families. Everyone had lost someone dear to them.\n\nNick Muddle, St Albans, UK We arrived back from Kata Beach on Phuket today as scheduled. Yes there are areas of complete devastation, but others are almost back to normal. Kata was lucky compared with the likes of Phi-Phi Patong and Khoa Lak, Are deepest sympathy goes out to all who lost families a friends, Having many Thai and expat friends who operate within the tourist industries on Phuket the message from them is Please don\'t desert us we need you to survive. In Kata beach apart from the beach beds being missing you would hardly know there had been a disaster. As a diver myself I have seen the underwater damage to the reefs, It is not as bad as some have reported, Yes there is a lot of sand and debris, but the marine life is still flourishing. So help the people in Phuket the way they want to be helped. Pack your suit cases and visit them,\n\nSteven Prior, Accrington The government is now suggesting that debts can be frozen - why don\'t all the governments wipe out the debts altogether - including Africa. This would mean so much to all the countries where life is difficult due to poverty even before the wave struck!\n\nJdun, England I agree with Mr Clinton. The countries offering aid should be split in areas they agree to manage and adopt and this way, it avoids duplication, and increase focus on a specified country. This stance should be taken once all the people have received food/aid, perhaps in a months time and agree long term plans.\n\nJay Kotecha, Bushey, UK I don\'t really think talking tourism is a good idea right now - especially if it means people just sitting on beaches or in bars as it appears is happening in parts of Phuket. I urge all holidaymakers out there now to get up from those beaches, put down your drinks and do whatever you can to help the effort for recovery, like many of us "not on the ground" are trying to do through fund raising.\n\nKen, Bournemouth UK Reading the views from the faithful and atheists; what is really evident is that apocalyptic events although rare point to one simple fact, mere humans stand little to no chance against the forces of nature.

I saw bodies floating in the sea and as I approached a couple of local men who were bringing a body ashore, they said she was dead so I went after another body, but the swell of the ocean was too much. Meanwhile Jude was giving mouth to mouth on the previous body - but with no response, the effort was futile. We were a few of the very fortunate ones to escape unscathed - others were not so lucky.\n\nPaul and Jude, Shropshire, England I was on the beach on Hong Island off the Thailand coast when the wave hit. I just want to pass on my heartfelt thanks to the local people who evacuated us from the island and also to the wonderful doctors, nurses and volunteers who treated us with such kindness at Krabi Hospital.\n\nJohn Chadwick, Kingston upon Thames, UK Being a Sri Lankan, I wish to express my deepest gratitude to the UK public who have given so generously to help the victims of this terrible disaster. I sincerely hope that every penny donated will be used for the purpose of bringing relief to the victims of all countries affected.\n\nRoshan Herath, High Wycombe, UK I was fortunate enough to have visited Phuket, Thailand, twice. Both times I have stayed at Merlin Beach Resort. It\'s very very sad what happened and my heart goes out to all who have been affected. When I see the photos of Patong when it got hit, I can\'t believe its the same Patong I visited only 8 months ago. My thoughts are with the ones who have lost their loved ones.\n\nMaria, Melbourne, Australia As a resident of Thailand, I find it all rather encouraging that tourists are beginning to return. But, it is the type of tourist returning here that makes my hair stand up. The majority of these people are enjoying their holidays as if nothing had happened. It would be nice, if any of them are reading these posts, if they would spend a little time perhaps in making financial donations, giving blood or helping in some manner that would make a difference. Ever thought of spending an afternoon visiting complete strangers in hospitals and giving them some support? To those that are making a difference, no matter how small, thank you. If you have friends or loved ones in the affected areas enjoying a holiday, ask them if they have made a difference today.\n\nStephen, Bangkok, Thailand As an Englishman living in Thailand I rely heavily on the BBC for news. I would like to thank you for your efforts in informing the world about the disaster that we are presently experiencing in Asia. I would also like to thank the British people for your outstanding generosity in this time of need. I have donated what I can but sadly I think it\'s not enough. I have one comment in particular to make and that is that although the West coast of Thailand has been hit by a Tsunami do not hesitate in coming for a holiday now or in the future. Phuket has not been hit as badly as the media suggest and the Thai people have extraordinary willpower and will welcome you with open hearts, as tourists, as much as before. Please, media around the world, show the positive as well as the negative.\n\nSam Sherwin, Bangkok, Thailand I came back from Phuket yesterday evening (3 Jan 05) after I\'d done my tiny part of helping out during my New Year\'s break. I\'ve seen loss..I\'ve felt loss, although none of my relatives or friends were there. Thanks for the comments that praised the Thais during the incident. I think all the people who are still helping out right now would be proud of what they\'ve done and are doing. For those who can make it home all right, please do take care of your life. Now you know how precious life is. For those who lost their love ones, I\'m very sorry about that. Please be strong.\n\nSuchada S., Bangkok, Thailand Although it\'s very sad to hear and read about the disaster tsunami has caused, it\'s very encouraging and heartening to learn that the Muslim, Hindu and Christian organisations in South India are helping their fellow Indians whatever religion/community the victims belong to. Hope, the world learns a thing or two from them.\n\nKalyan, India After watching the devastating news for the last week or so it was wonderful this morning to do something practical by attending an appeal in our local village that was organised through Meltham Churches Together to raise funds for the Tsunami appeal; I couldn\'t believe how much had been done with regard to giving things to be sold and the amount of people involved in the coffee morning; everybody wanted to do something, however small. My husband also went to the local Oxfam shop to help out but unfortunately it was shut but he is going to try again at the weekend. What we must remember is that the damage will not be solved quickly and that practical help is going to be needed in the long term. I pray that communities will come together and work as one to do what is needed. Sometimes it seems so inadequate, but if we all try to do something we can move mountains.\n\nCorrine Scandling, Huddersfield, England The thoughts of missing children and devastated families have occupied my thoughts since this tragedy occurred. We send money through the Red Cross and community fundraising, but there remains that extremely frustrating feeling of helplessness, of not being able to change what occurred. All we can hope is that the assistance we CAN offer will continue for the years it is needed, and that in the future extensive warning systems will be utilised to prevent this from ever happening again. I wish desperately for the victims\' families to find some sort of peace over time. Love from New York.\n\nL.P., New York, USA Within two hours of the first wave hitting our shores my church had already used our extensive network to get through to people to request dry rations and clothes. When my wife and I drove into church by 4pm with the goods, the ladies had already finished cooking the first batch of meals to be sent out. Volunteers were turning up each minute to help distribute. Over the next 4 days over 30 tons of food was collected and sent to mainly the East and North East as collectively everyone felt that this was the area that would need it the most. The reaction and warmth of Sri Lankans could not have been more ably shown.\n\nLenny, Dehiwela, Sri Lanka There was a bunch of friends who organised a relief effort of two lorry loads of dry rations and water to be given to the affected in the east. The nicest gesture was from a group of Norwegians who actually came to Colombo to attend a wedding and ended up giving all the money they had in order for us to facilitate what was needed. Two of them also travelled to the east and helped to distribute rations to those affected.\n\nKashyapa Casper, Mount Lavinia, Sri Lanka My mother and father have put out a donation box in our restaurant for the tsunami victims. We weren\'t expecting the response we got. In a few days we have made a couple thousand dollars with generous donations from our patrons. On the 15th my father is flying back home to Thailand and he is going to deliver the money personally to the people in Phuket. It\'s really touching to know such kindness from strangers exists. I just want to thank everyone who has helped in some way for the victims of the tsunami.\n\nPloi, Virginia, USA I was fortunate to have visited Thailand 2 years ago (Bangkok, Krabi, Koh Phi Phi and Phuket)....it is truly a wonderful country full of equally wonderful people. After this natural tragedy that has taken so many lives, my blessings go to all that have lost a love one. I feel Thai today, and ask all others, like I definitively will, to visit soon this wonderful Kingdom, no better way to pay them back for all their courage and kindness to all victims!\n\nAgustin Yerovi, Ecuador On Sunday we made contact with our daughter Lynda, who together with her Indian husband Benny manage The Wild Orchid Resort on Havelock island, part of the Andaman group of islands, India. In spite of all the devastation on the Andaman and Nicobar islands, caused by last Sunday\'s tsunami, Havelock Island sustained very little damage and no fatalities. Due to the orientatation of the island and shallow waters they experienced just a very high tide causing some minor flooding. When the tsunami hit, Lynda had just boarded a ferry for her return to Havelock from Port Blair. When the first wave hit, the Captain immediately sounded the alarm and headed full speed for open waters. Not a minute too late, because when the subsequent much larger waves hit the harbour, the jetty where the ferry was moored had disappeared. The ferry then headed to Havelock island, but was unable to tie up, because this jetty was flooded. After the seas calmed some 9 hours after departure, the ferry returned to Port Blair. The next day Lynda returned to Havelock and to her husband Benny who only knew she had been on the ferry when the tsunami hit.\n\nArt and Klazina Ketting, Lanark, Ontario, Canada I would like express my extreme sorrow for all affected. I arrived on Phuket three days ago and am impressed to see how the island has recovered. Isn\'t it time to show some good news? Phuket is a miracle island with only a few hundred casualties, not to be confused with other locations on the mainland who were less fortunate. Phuket\'s infrastructure is 100% intact. The best way of helping the local people is by spreading the good news instead of repeatedly showing week-old video clips.\n\nJohn Beck, Phuket, Thailand In reference to John Beck\'s posting, I find it simplistic in the extreme and almost insulting. There are still thousands missing. Lives and entire families have been devastated. Insurance for the small Mum and Dad shops that were washed away? Forget it. I have just spoken to the general manager of an European airline who is now (noon Tuesday Bangkok time) sending off the last of some 30 or 40 flights over the past week with victims, live and sadly dead. His staff have been working 24 hour shifts. I trust that Mr Beck\'s holiday is not inconvenienced by the reality of what has happened.\n\nStephen, Bangkok, Thailand Today I received an email from a friend in Galle Fort who witnessed the tsunami from the ramparts beside the Amangalla Hotel (formerly New Oriental):\n\n"...We watched in wonder from the hotel, puzzling what it was. It was not until we saw the roofs below us moving with people crashing towards the ramparts wall that we realised. The water flooded through the old gate of the Fort, carrying boats and cars with it. One of those boats is now outside my house. To give you an idea of the force of this water, the boat is so heavy we are still unable to move it without a JCB. Two days after I walked out into town. The shock of the devastation and carnage is still with me. It was 100 times worse than I had imagined."\n\nJoe Simpson, Duncan, BC, Canada Due to our boat guy\'s skill, he rode them out without tipping us over\n\nLee & Lisa Matthews, West Sussex My wife and I are on Railay Beach, Krabi, Thailand. Our snorkelling trip was delayed by half an hour. Our boat guy was driving slowly when he suddenly took the propeller out the water to turn the boat around. We were watching biblical proportion waves crashing 3/4 the way up the islands. The walls of water headed our way were near 15ft but due to our boat guy\'s skill, he rode them out without tipping us over. There were 4 boats sunk and a 5th boat laden with snorkelling tourists missing people. Anxious to make it back, our driver negotiated the bounce back from the land which nearly threatened to tip us over again. Near the beach, we had to wait for a lull in the waves before motoring it safely in. If we hadn\'t been delayed, we would have been snorkelling where they were pulling out bodies. We were lucky today.\n\nLee & Lisa Matthews, Crawley, West Sussex, UK At Railay Beach West, Phra Nang and Tonsai the bungalows, bars and restaurants have been washed out. I was on Phra Nang beach when the wave hit and there was general panic. Yachts and boats were being flipped over and people out swimming were trapped in caves. Lots of people were cut up and hurt in the initial surge as they were swept from the beach. People are reported to be missing who were out diving or on long boats. The helicopters have been lifting the badly injured out and there is electricity. No one really knows what\'s going on.\n\nZoe, Railay, Krabi How does one celebrate good fortune, in the face of such devastation?\n\nElaine Armstrong, UAE It is a most eerie feeling, me sitting here safe in my home watching the horror and heartbreak of the earthquake. I had a seat on a flight, a last minute, invitation to go to Phuket on Christmas Day, however after many phone calls, I was unable to get a room in any hotel on Patpong Beach. The series of my emotions overwhelm me, how does one celebrate their good fortune, in the face of such devastation to other families?\n\nElaine Armstrong, UAE Arrived back in the UK on 29 Dec from the South West coast of Sri Lanka, where we watched the tsunami surge up the beach, into the swimming pool, and finally destroy the whole ground floor of the Koggala Beach Hotel - 15kms east of Galle. We were evacuated to a nearby Buddhist temple, where the Monks very generously welcomed 200 plus tourists into their home. The entire night was spent listening to helicopter rescue missions from the Air Force base close to the temple. The people of Sri Lanka cannot be commended enough on their sterling effort in ensuring our safety and wellbeing, despite their own suffering and devastation. It was truly a lesson in humility for us all.\n\nHazel McCullough, Chester, UK We never came across a nation with so much kindness and care\n\nToni and Ruth Cacciapaglia, Krabi We were on Phi Phi and escaped to the highest point of the resort where we spent the night. We saw the killer wave approach and it was terrifying. A make-shift hospital near the tennis court where the helicopter could land to transport the most serious cases to Phuket hospital. We would like everybody to know the Thais have been incredible in dealing with this disaster. We never came across a nation with so much kindness and care, even when the situation is dire. Many of the locals cannot swim and are petrified of water, yet they tried their utmost to make it bearable for us. We are deeply touched and would urge people to keep coming to this country because there are many places that have not been hit and tourism is a huge earner here. The worst would be to stay away now!\n\nToni and Ruth Cacciapaglia, Krabi - resident in London, UK £50 just doesn\'t seem enough. I can replace that money with time, but these people cannot replace what has been lost. How could anyone turn their back? Words can\'t describe what we are seeing. This is the time we need to unite and help those who need it the most.\n\nBeth, Gloucester, England There are white flags of mourning all over Sri Lanka, and each day the death toll seems to be rising. The only way people can find some solace amidst all this destruction is to give all that they can to those who have nothing left. The amount of human compassion and support is astounding. It is, however, sad that it takes an act of nature for people to realise how fragile our existence is, and that really all the discrimination and the politics ultimately has very little value. The psychological impact of this is never going to leave\n\nFathimath, Colombo Maldives, one could say was lucky in this disaster compared to countries such as Indonesia and Sri Lanka, but there is still extensive work needed. Whole islands have been flattened leaving no buildings or infrastructure left. Horrific stories of a mother breastfeeding her three month old baby on the beach early that morning, and then losing her baby as the wave swept her away are only now coming out, as traumatised people start talking. It becomes apparent that relief in terms of physical supplies is not enough, the psychological impact of this is never going to leave these people and these countries.\n\nFathimath, Colombo, Sri Lanka originally Maldives The Asian disaster came as a shock to the whole world at the end of the year. It was indeed sad to see people dying so inhumanly. It was indeed a great disaster not only to the affected countries but also the rest. This is the testing time not only for the government but also the public to come together and contribute a little in their own way. Let us not say it just with words but by putting them into action. Let us join our hands to make a difference to those who have lost their loved ones in the disaster.\n\nBasty Latha Shenoy, Mangalore, India I was very pleased to hear that some tourists have decided not to cancel their trip to Phuket this year and are, instead, helping with the clean up operation on the island. This is commendable action, as the island economy depends heavily on tourism and, as one of them said, it would be far worse for the affected people here if they had not come.\n\nTom Bishop, Chalong, Phuket , Thailand Although news broadcasts say aid is only just reaching Aceh a friend of ours working in Bali has already got the first truckload of aid into the area with a further 17 lorries on the way if not there by now. A number of local NGOs have got together to get help underway much faster that the international agencies can get there. She has sent the following appeal for volunteers - "We are coordinating volunteers to go to Sumatra. Please contact us at hp: 081-338-401653 for more info only if you are a skilled volunteer in any of the following categories (doctors, paramedics, peace-corps trained level volunteers) with Bahasa Indonesia skills, financial independence, vaccinated, valid visa, willing to commit to several weeks at least. Discounted vaccinations are available for volunteers via IDEP Aceh Aid initiative that are going to Sumatra from the International SOS clinic in Bali." Can anyone help?\n\nMargaret Underwood, Abergavenny, Wales We were shown the mosque where locals were cooking and distributing food\n\nAlison Clarke, Chelmsford My partner and I were staying in Beruwela on the South-West coast of Sri Lanka when the tsunami hit. We watched from the first floor of our hotel as a wall of water swept in and tore the ground floor apart underneath us. Waiting to be evacuated to Colombo was very frightening as everyone was fearful of another and possibly bigger wave coming. At one stage we heard (wrongly) that another wave was coming and there was panic. Miraculously a fleet of small vehicle driven by local people arrived outside the hotel and we just jumped into a minibus. We were taken up a hill to a place of safety where we were welcomed by a family and told we could stay as long as we needed to, amid all this death and destruction these people were trying to help us! We were shown the local mosque where hundred of locals were cooking, collecting and distributing food and supplies for those less fortunate. In the three days we were waiting to leave we saw many examples of ordinary Sri Lankans, many of whom had lost friends, family and livelihoods trying to help others who were worse off, it was a very moving experience. We have since been in contact with the family who took us in and they are saying that what their country needs most urgently is practical help. Doctors, nurses and medicines, help with clearing roads and restoring electricity and water supplies. These people would have done anything to help us, it is time for the British Government to do more to help them.\n\nAlison Clarke, Chelmsford UK I live in Batticaloa, which is most affected area in eastern province of Sri Lanka. I have many sad stories to tell. But i don\'t know which is first. One of my friends lost his younger sister (16 years old) and all his properties. Another my friend Murali lost all his family members (mother, sister and two brothers). My sister\'s friend had a baby on 23 December 2004. Tsunami took away her with just 3-day-old baby. I can\'t believe it, but these are true. Who takes responsible for all of this? May God bless my country.\n\nKuhan, Batticaloa, Srilanka Having just spoken to my brother who has just returned from Thailand I was obviously very pleased he and his wife were safe, however they had been on the east side of Thailand, and he said everything there was fine and they had had a lovely time in their hotel, even a gala and dinner on new year\'s eve with ice sculptures and lots of eating and partying! Doesn\'t the east side of the island want to help their fellow citizens on the west? What is going on, what kind of world do we live in? Yes the tourism will help the coutry as a whole survive, but surely this is taking things too far?\n\nK Keech, Hull, England Though the disaster is high in Asia, but Somalia also is suffering. see the pictures from CNN. http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/africa/12/31/\n\ntsunami.somalia.ap/\n\nAbdishakur Mohamud Moalin, Vantaa, Finland Can the press please stop with their nationalist bidding of the UK being the highest donator? It is false information: per capita the Swedes and the Dutch have given multiples of what the British are giving. The Dutch alone - in total - almost as much as the USA. If calculated per capita, the UK and the USA are at the bottom of the list, not at the top. Surprise, surprise!\n\nJan de Landtsheer, Littlehampton, UK Well, today (1/1/05) after another round of awful figures in the papers it felt awful just to be sitting in a secluded courtyard in a French world almost as far removed from India as we felt removed from the chaos only kilometers away. A report in the papers metioned that there is a relief camp at the Pondicherry University campus only 15km north and the tourist information suggested that if we wanted to then metal cups and plates and rice would be useful to them there. Not knowing the situation or what they really needed we bought 30 plates and cups and 25kilos of rice - all we could carry by ourselves and on the bus. We arrived to a scene of chaos: no structures, no camp, no organisation. Just families destitute sitting by the sides of the road and clamouring for the pitiful little we had managed to take - what good are 30 plates for 1000 people? There was no one to give the supplies to - the only people distributing any aid was a bus full of volunteers and foodstuffs from Tiruvanamellai. No government, no police, no NGOs nothing. Only the bemused university security guards. These volunteers at the behest of some of the men from the village made us hide the supplies - to give so little to so many would only result in bitter acrimony and infighting. It was awful to remove from grabbing hands what they so desperately needed. We were taken then on a tour of the devastation. While from the road all looked well enough, 30m in the picture was completely different. Mud brick and thatch huts completely decimated. Flattened leaving only rubble and piles of straw. The engines and long propeller shafts of disappeared boats lay like glistening entrails amongst the rubbish. Here and there a lady forlornly picking at whatever remained of her house. It was a dreadful scene of disaster and enormously humbling. Our small contribution paled ridiculously. We resolved to return tomorrow with 300 plates and a substantial number of cooking pots. They have food but nothing to cook it in and nothing to eat it off and no one has yet given anything of this sort - the money can pour into India but it will take a while for any of this to really reach the people on the ground. People at the camp are already succumbing to diarrhoea. We have already ordered the 300 plates and our budget can only really stretch to the 50 additional rice pots and lids we have ordered. They had wanted 300. But we have no lorries, only a rickshaw. I fear that the small number of cooking pots will be laughed away once again. We need contributions to allow us to buy another 50 with lids c. 70GBP, which we should be able to squeeze into the same rickshaw. I shall be returning tomorrow at about 1200. It is certainly very hard to comprehend how all these displaced people only 15km north of such a relatively prosperous city and state could be so neglected.\n\nOliver Twinch, At Pondicherry The generosity, compassion and efficiency of the Thai people made this whole ordeal significantly less traumatic\n\nSheri Pickering, London My family and I were staying on Patong Beach over Xmas, and were very fortunate to escape in one piece, with only my father suffering superficial injuries from being hit by the second wave whilst trying to climb onto our villa roof. This much cannot be said for many other people at our hotel, and in the general area of Patong. We cannot believe our good fortune, and would like to make special mention of the generosity, compassion and efficiency of the Thai people (police, medical, immigration etc, as well as the locals) who made this whole ordeal significantly less traumatic than it could have been. We are all safe back home now (Mum and Dad in Adelaide, and my brother and I in London), and we would ask all readers to please dig deep for the many thousands of people not as lucky as us. Sheri Pickering\n\nSheri Pickering, London, UK I\'m flying out to Trivandrum on the 2nd of Jan to deliver supplies and help directly 10,000 refugees; mainly the families of lost fisherman, based in Southern Kerela, India. If anybody would like to come/raise funds/donate money for food please contact me asap.\n\nHoward Carter, London, UK The worst affected areas are the northern part of Sri Lanka, such as Batticaloa, Mullaittivu and the eastern coastal lines. Unfortunately, the reporters are just only reporting from Galle, but the other parts are being ignored even by the government. The aid is being sent to Sri Lanka but not being supplied to the North. This is the truth and the people are dying but, the supplies don\'t go to the East (the most and the worst effected areas). BBC reporters should consider this and should broadcast about the government\'s political ignorance. If you could contact the charity organisation in the Mullaittivu district to get the information, the number is 0094712390604.\n\nDearan, London, UK. At last I have just spoken to our friend a Sri Lankan, his village has just received fresh water, he was touched to hear the huge amounts of money raised for the victims of the Tsunami and asked me to thank everyone.\n\nTrina, Rochester Kent The sea disappeared back to the line in the distance leaving a sea bed full of fish, octopuses etc\n\nAndrew Molloy, Loughborough Myself and my family were at the Pelangi beach resort in Langkawi on the devastating day. I was in the sea which is normally like a mill pond when I noticed a line of surf about half a mile out at sea which was so strange I ran to our ocean view room and called my family to come out to look they joined me on the beach when almost instantly the sea disappeared back to the line of surf in the distance leaving a sea bed full of fish, octopuses etc. It was then that the sea just attacked. It came in so fast there were people still on the beach. My wife and kids ran through the grounds somehow, just keeping in front of the giant swell. I could see a man crying, he stood still in shock with his daughter crying for help, stuck in the water. I managed to get her to safety along with her father. I then turned to see a elderly guy with his arms out but I couldn\'t get to him through the pressure of the wave he travelled passed me at such speed I was too late, I decided to try to make my way through the ground to safety but the problems I had was that the air conditioning units were all under water and they were all going bang with all smoke and I was fearing getting electrocuted. To add to this the pool at the hotel is a lagoon style which covers most of the grounds and had become invisible under all the filthy water and my concerns were then that small children and the like may have submerged into the pool below. I carried a few maids to the safer places on my way. Out there was mass panic and it took me two hours to find my family who were across the main road in a raised area. We stayed in a school the next night and with great difficulty got a flight home the next day. We were due to go to Penang the next day but were told by our rep that they had it worse than us. To cap it off, nobody died at our hotel which was a miracle but my thoughts are with the families and friends of the dead in other areas.\n\nAndrew Molloy, Loughborough England My son and his girlfriend are in Sri Lanka and we found out they were OK on Monday, 27 December. We had 26 hours of sheer torture. Our hearts go out to all the other families who are still waiting for news.\n\nChristina Dadge, Liverpool, United Kingdom On behalf of Thai people, I would like to thank for all your help, and for all stories listed here. I know that all Thai, as hosts, will not let any of their friends facing the disaster alone. I believe that they do their best. I wrote this with tears, have lost friends at Phra Thong Island\n\nPardon Bhlapibul, Bangkok Thailand I am now recovering in a Bangkok hospital\n\nSimon Dowell, Chester My partner and I were waiting for a boat on a floating jetty on Thailand\'s Phi Phi island when the tsunami hit us. It swept us into the sea but we managed to clamber aboard a nearby boat and survived. The boat was sinking but rode the second wave and we were able to jump to a more sturdy boat. Eventually a passing speed boat picked us up (together with a couple from Argentina who had also climbed aboard) and we then spent about 5 hours on the sea riding the waves until it could get close enough in to shore for us to swim to safety. We spent the night in the open on a high point on the island being looked after by tourists and locals alike. The next day, because I was injured, we were carried by helicopter to Phuket, got treatment in the hospital there and then were driven by ambulance straight onto the tarmac of Phuket airport and into a plane for Bangkok, all free of charge. I am now recovering in a Bangkok hospital. The generosity and kindness of the Thai people has been overwhelming. We have had free flights, first class and efficient treatment in hospitals, even in Phuket which was inundated with patients. Their organisation was fantastic. Back in Bangkok friends and strangers alike have been wonderful. The Thais really are very special people and their organisation and efficiency in dealing with this disaster must be given the highest praise by the international community. My heart goes out to those who have lost loved ones and who are injured, we share in their grief.\n\nSimon Dowell, Chester I sincerely believe that the Indian governmment should not have refused help from outside. For one, the management of the disaster is poor and not meticulous. The target reach has not even been remotely achieved. I am a medical student, and I see an even more potential disaster from diseases. In Nagapattinam, not one is willing to touch the dead bodies, which still lie scattered decomposing. India and other countries need every help possible.\n\nBalaji Ravichandran, Chennai (Madras), India I am currently in Sri Lanka staying with friends in the village of Waskaduwa on the South West coast. This area was not one of the worst hit but along the beach front many houses have been flattened and people killed. The people did not have much to start with, they have now lost what little they had. I would appeal to everybody to give as much as they can to the relief organizations. The task they face here is huge. The damage to the infra-structure here will take months if not years to repair. I am sure that with the help of the rich nations the people of Sri Lanka and the other countries will come through this tragedy.\n\nRobert Cox, Gloucester, UK To anyone intending to go to the disaster zone still as tourists as tourist: why not make space in your suitcase to take spare clothes, simple things like pain killers, a box of surgical gloves, face masks, shoes. If you call any on the help lines you can ask what is urgently needed and what exactly to take.\n\nChristianna Franck, London I like to thank wholeheartedly the British public for their enormous generosity to Sri Lankan people. I am a Sri Lankan living in Uk. I am touched by these gestures like any other Sri Lankan, for the continuous support we had from everyone. The continuous support given by the public has given us strength and hope for the future.\n\nMelanie Lunuwila-Arulraj, London This is the horrifying natural disaster and heart breaking to see the condition of the victims, as the damage unfolds you can imagine how small human beings in the forces of nature.\n\nAP Saradhi, Vizag, India I\'ve just watched a live news report (15.10 Thai Time,1 Jan 2005) from BBC World TV from the top of the Novotel in Patong. The video shot behind the reporter shows incomplete buildings and piles of rubble in the foreground. The reporter implies that these building have been damaged or fallen down by the wave. In fact these buildings were not touched by the water and are under construction and that\'s why they are not complete and the rubble in the foreground is the vacant site where the trucks are dumping all the rubble collected from along the streets of Patong. No concrete constructed buildings have fallen down (as far as I know) in Patong. Shame on the BBC, one of the most respected and trusted TV channels. Last night a friend of mine actually visited the Novotel to challenge this BBC about just that sort of reporting from the Novotel rooftop. Many of us locals and tourists here in Patong are furious about this negative, sensational, and incorrect reporting about Patong. Reporters are getting mixed up with other very badly damaged areas of Thailand (Khao Lak & Phi Phi) and other countries unfortunate enough to have suffered much more severe damage and death toll.

The images will help improve future forecasts of the deadly waves.\n\nThe US-French satellites, called TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1, passed over the Bay of Bengal two hours after the massive earthquake struck just off the coast of Indonesia.\n\nThat is “just about the time the leading edge of the tsunami was hitting Sri Lanka and India”, says Lee-Lueng Fu, project scientist for the satellites at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, US.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe satellites did not observe coastal areas. But for eight minutes, they used radar to measure the sea level along a 3000-kilometre-long track of ocean. This image of the bay as the tsunami rolled through it provides a unique and valuable continuous measure of the waves. In contrast, the floating sensors suggested as part of any future early-warning system can only provide measurements at single points, says Fu.\n\n“There are no other observations of a similar nature anywhere in the world,” he told New Scientist.\n\nFast as jets\n\nThe satellites saw the first two wavefronts produced by the main quake, spaced 500 to 800 kilometres apart. These waves reached a maximum height of 50 centimetres in the open ocean, only reaching their full devastating height when entering the shallow waters of the coast.\n\nBy comparison, wind-driven waves typically reach 10 metres. However, these waves only involve water close to the ocean surface and are separated by at most several hundred metres.\n\nTsunami waves have a very deep reach indeed – 4000 metres or more. “These waves involve the entire depth of the ocean. Their energy is thousands of times more than a monster storm,” Fu says. And even though tsunamis barely ripple the surface, they speed through the water as fast as jet airliners.\n\nFu hopes the observations will improve tsunami warning systems by providing vital new data to calibrate tsunami models. Just after an earthquake, seismometers around the world help pinpoint the source. That data is then sent to tsunami modellers who use the information to compute the probable height and arrival of any resulting waves.\n\nThe key number in the modelling is wave height in deep water, as this indicates energy, and that is exactly what the radar recorded. Fu adds that, because the waves take time to travel to land, “when you see waves in the open ocean this large, you have time to warn people on the coast”.\n\nThe observations also showed smaller features. Piggybacking on top of the main waves were smaller ripples about 100 or 200 kilometres apart. “This is the first observation of details of tsunami waves,” says Fu.', 'title': 'Radar satellites capture tsunami wave height', 'url': 'https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn6854-radar-satellites-capture-tsunami-wave-height/', 'keywords': ['observations', 'wave', 'earthquake', 'tsunami', 'satellites', 'height', 'capture', 'deep', 'water', 'ocean', 'waves', 'fu', 'radar'], 'tags': {'Earth', 'News'}, 'summary': 'Tsunami waves have a very deep reach indeed – 4000 metres or more.\nFu hopes the observations will improve tsunami warning systems by providing vital new data to calibrate tsunami models.\nThat data is then sent to tsunami modellers who use the information to compute the probable height and arrival of any resulting waves.\nThe key number in the modelling is wave height in deep water, as this indicates energy, and that is exactly what the radar recorded.\n“This is the first observation of details of tsunami waves,” says Fu.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'Health experts fear disease could double the death toll\n\nMore than 50,000 people are now known to have died, but more bodies are being discovered every hour in many of the countries affected.\n\nSunday\'s undersea quake triggered sea surges that also displaced millions.\n\nInternational disaster assessment teams are arriving and local agencies are distributing emergency aid.\n\nBut the disaster zone is now threatened with outbreaks of disease, which the UN health agency has warned could double the death toll.\n\nSri Lanka, Indonesia, India and Thailand were among the worst hit by Sunday\'s 9.0 magnitude earthquake, which sent huge waves from Malaysia to Africa.\n\nClick here for map of affected area\n\nThe UN has said it faces an unprecedented challenge in co-ordinating distribution of aid to some 10 nations at once.\n\nIn several of those nations, some outlying towns and villages have not yet even been reached.

But they do agree that animals can hear and feel things that humans can’t.\n\n“I don’t think it’s a sixth sense — at least nothing we can measure at this point,” said Diana Reiss, Ph.D., director of marine mammal research at the Wildlife Conservation Society, based at the Bronx Zoo (search) in New York City. “Animals have very refined senses. In many species, they have sensory abilities beyond ours.”\n\nFor years, scientists have been trying to determine whether those sensory abilities can someday be captured and used by humans — and their governments — for detecting natural disasters.\n\nResearchers in China have been studying the issue as early as the 1950s and have found that some animals, like snakes, can detect earthquakes in advance. Snakes were seen slithering out of their dens in the middle of winter hibernation, and other animals also seemed to sense quakes before they hit.\n\nAnd in Kenya, Africa, one of the longest-running projects studying elephants (including their keen senses), the Savanna Elephant Vocalization Project (search), has been going for 25 years.\n\n“I don’t know that it’s something that can be quantified and repeatedly observed,” said Ravi Corea, president and founder of the Sri Lanka Wildlife Conservation Society. Corea is in the badly hit island nation helping the government in the ecological relief effort.\n\n“The study of animals has really only been going on in the last 50 years. A lot has been learned in a short time, but it will take a couple of centuries to come to a point where we’re truly understanding what they’re saying.”\n\nThere have been stories in Sri Lanka and Thailand of elephants running for the hills up to an hour before the tsunami bore down on the coastal lands, wiping out entire villages and killing up to 150,000 people.\n\nIn Sri Lanka’s second largest wildlife preserve, Yala National Park (search), people reportedly observed three elephants running away from the shore area to higher ground an hour before the tsunami hit, Corea said.\n\nThere were other reports that elephants in Thailand carried tourists on their backs to safety before the coastal areas were inundated.\n\nReiss and Corea said the explanation lies in the fact that the beasts have phenomenal hearing. They said elephants can both respond to and produce infrasound — sound at a lower frequency than human beings can hear. Other mammals with a similar capability include certain types of whales.\n\n“It’s possible that geographic upheavals create low-frequency sounds that are not audible to us, but for an elephant … it absorbs the sound waves and can hear them,” said Corea.\n\nYala National Park, which had been home to at least 250 elephants, was particularly hard-hit by the tsunami. About 40 visitors were washed out to sea among the roughly 200 who died there, according to The Associated Press.\n\nTwo of the elephants in the park had tracking collars, though Corea declined to comment on what, if anything, researchers have discovered in the data analysis.\n\nAnd elephants weren’t the only animals seen turning away from the shore before the tsunami hit. Birds, monkeys, dogs and other creatures were all reportedly acting differently on the morning of Dec. 26.\n\nCorea, a Sri Lankan who immigrated to the U.S. 20 years ago, said he has seen few animal carcasses in his surveys of the park, as well as in Colombo (search), Galle (search) and other places affected by the disaster. In Yala, there were only a couple of dead buffalo after the water receded.\n\n“There have been no reports of elephant carcasses, deer, leopards, black bears, sloth bears,” Corea said. He drove through towns like Galle, which are full of stray animals, and “didn’t see any dead cows or goats. … My colleague saw only one dead cat.”\n\nAnimals might be highly sensitive to their environments, but they also look to other animals for cues that there\'s danger coming, according to Corea.\n\nBut some scientists have scoffed at the notion that animals have "super sense" and doubt they survived in the large numbers that others have suggested.\n\n“It’s an urban legend,” said Brooks Hanson, deputy managing editor for physical sciences at the journal Science.\n\n“Different people feel earthquakes differently, so maybe animals could, too. But a tsunami? No way. … I have heard rumors that none of the animals were killed, but how do they know that? Did they take a census?”\n\nReiss agreed that there could be other explanations for the vast absence of dead animals among the human casualties and ruin wrought by the tsunami.\n\n“It’s conceivable that some of the animals were washed out to sea,” she said. “Lots of animals died in the tsunami … goats, dogs, cats, etc.”\n\nStill, Corea has heard several accounts of strange animal behavior in the minutes before the tsunami hit the region.\n\nHe said a friend saw some bats — which are nocturnal and normally sleep upside-down during the day — very active about a half hour before the wave came. Another of Corea’s friends who lives in the hills told him his two Doberman Pinschers refused to go for their daily jog along the beach about 90 minutes before the tsunami.\n\n“They wouldn’t respond to his enticements,” Corea said. “These are dogs that would normally be happy and bouncing and waiting for their run. That day they were totally disinterested.”\n\nCorea also heard a story about visitors to the park who were trying to feed bananas to some monkeys when the tsunami came ashore — and the monkeys turned their noses up, literally.\n\n“Bananas would be something normally that would make monkeys go bananas,” he said. “These monkeys were totally disinterested, staring up in a confused mode as if they were reacting to something.”\n\nIf nothing else, perhaps these stories teach people that they’re best off watching the wild for cues.\n\n“It does show that there is some value in being more aware of what’s happening in nature,” said Tom Dillon, director of endangered species at the World Wildlife Fund.\n\nAdded Corea: "Wild animals survive by being always alert. That\'s what keeps them alive. Nature is very resilient. We shouldn\'t forget the fact that we are also part of nature."', 'title': 'Tsunami Animals: A Sixth Sense?', 'url': 'http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/01/09/tsunami-animals-sixth-sense.html', 'keywords': ['monkeys', 'elephants', 'wild', 'sense', 'corea', 'sri', 'tsunami', 'park', 'wildlife', 'sixth', 'search', 'animals'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'By now, the stories of wild animals fleeing the deadly tsunami (search) before it struck Asia and Africa are near legendary.\nSnakes were seen slithering out of their dens in the middle of winter hibernation, and other animals also seemed to sense quakes before they hit.\nAnd elephants weren’t the only animals seen turning away from the shore before the tsunami hit.\n“Lots of animals died in the tsunami … goats, dogs, cats, etc.”Still, Corea has heard several accounts of strange animal behavior in the minutes before the tsunami hit the region.\nAdded Corea: "Wild animals survive by being always alert.', 'date': 1105228800}, {'text': 'Thank you for your interest in spreading the word about Science.\n\nNOTE: We only request your email address so that the person you are recommending the page to knows that you wanted them to see it, and that it is not junk mail.

The death toll is provisional and expected to rise further as relief and rescue workers comb through the wreckage, access isolated towns and villages and attempt to track down thousands of missing people.\n\nThe worst affected areas are the east coast of Sri Lanka, southern India and the Indonesian province of Aceh on the northern tip of Sumatra, which was hit hard by the initial earthquake. Without warning, waves of up to 10 metres engulfed whole villages, sank fishing vessels and swept people, many of them young children and the elderly, out to sea. Many of the worst affected are the poorest—fishermen and others forced to live in vulnerable coastal communities.\n\nThe low-lying Maldives and the Andaman Islands were also struck. Coastal areas of Thailand, including the holiday resort island of Phuket, Malaysia and Burma were pounded by massive seas. At least two people were killed in Bangladesh. The tsunami impacted as far away as east Africa—6,000 kilometres to the west—including Kenya, Somalia and Tanzania. Nine people were killed in Somalia.\n\nThe National Earthquake Centre at the US Geological Survey measured the quake at 8.9 on the Richter Scale making it the largest since 1964 and the fifth largest since 1900. The main tremor hit just before 7 a.m. local time in Sumatra and was followed over the next two hours by a series of aftershocks, some of them major earthquakes in their own right.\n\nThe shockwaves were recorded almost instantaneously by seismological stations around the world, but neither Sri Lanka nor India is part of the international tsunami warning system. Although the wave took at least 90 minutes to travel to South Asia, no-one was alerted to the danger and nothing was done to avert the terrible tragedy that has killed thousands, left millions without homes, food or water, and wreaked havoc on crops and businesses.\n\nThe international warning system was established in the 1960s to assist in predicting the path and speed of tsunamis, which travel at high speed in deep water with no visible disturbance on the surface. Only when the shock waves reach shallow water do they climb to great heights and become visible.\n\nDr R.S. Dattatrayam, director (seismology) at the India Meteorological Department, explained to the Times of India that his team had detected the quake, but could not predict the tidal wave. “We had indications pretty early in the morning, almost soon after it originated [in Indonesia]. But we were not prepared to gauge it. We don’t have the facilities for tsunami. We knew something would be hitting us, but couldn’t tell the time, the location and the intensity.”\n\nIndian and Sri Lankan politicians have brushed aside questions about the lack of a warning system, saying that yesterday’s tsunami was the first in recent years to hit the subcontinent. There is no doubt, however, that thousands of lives could have been saved if immediate action had been taken to alert the most vulnerable areas. Belatedly, the Indian government has announced that it will initiate steps to join the tsunami-warning network.\n\nThe consequences of this inaction are nothing short of catastrophic.\n\nYesterday’s tsunami is the country’s worst natural disaster. As of late last night, the Sri Lankan Defence Ministry had confirmed the deaths of 2,484 people, but unofficial estimates put the figure much higher at around 5,000. The worst affected areas are along the east coast, much of which has been the focus of the country’s protracted 20-year civil war. By yesterday evening, the official death toll for Amparai was 900, for Batticaloa 300 and Trincomalee 300.\n\nIn Amparai, locals warned that many more are dead as whole villages have been destroyed. According to Hazir, a resident of Saindamarudu, the number killed could be anything between 3,000 to 4,000. Sri Lanka Muslim Congress leader Rauff Hakeem said that there were 1,000 bodies in Saindamarudu alone. “There are bodies everywhere and more and more keep coming,” he said.\n\nIn areas under the control of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), the figure remains unknown. The Sri Lankan military estimates that 500 people died in the Mullaitivu district near the LTTE headquarters. But according to the LTTE-based Tamil Rehabilitation Organisation (TRO), the toll could be as high as 2,000 for the Mullaitivu district and another 1,000 in Jaffna district.\n\nOn the southern tip of the island, 866 were killed in Galle, 250 in Matara and 160 in Weligama. Matara police chief Chandana Wickremaratne told Agence France Press: “Hundreds of people were at the weekly Sunday fair when massive waves came in and washed away people. We don’t know what happened to them. There are many people who have seen bodies floating in the water. The water level is going down, but we have a huge problem of water as sea water has got into the drinking water supply.”\n\nTourists in southern resorts were forced to seek shelter in stadiums and banquet halls. The roads to the capital Colombo were choked with traffic as residents and tourists fled the affected areas. Even though it lies on the west coast, Colombo was also hit, with a number of coastal areas swamped. According to the Daily Mirror, about 25 people, mostly young children, were swept away by huge waves in the northern suburbs. In Colombo harbour, large ships were battered and left listing to one side.\n\nThe scale of the disaster is yet to be accurately determined. The government estimated that at least one million people, or 5 percent of the population, have been affected. President Chandrika Kumaratunga, who is returning from Britain, has declared a “state of disaster”, authorised the use of the military and appealed for international aid.\n\nPolice imposed curfews in some areas aimed at preventing looting. But many people lack shelter and basic necessities such as food and clean water, leaving them vulnerable to disease. Even in Colombo, one angry resident exclaimed to the Daily Mirror: “We need water. We need food. Where are the leaders?”\n\nAt least 3,000 people were killed in southern India, with the state of Tamil Nadu accounting for over 1,700 dead. In the state capital of Madras, the official toll stood at 131 late yesterday. The Hindu explained: [T]he three major government hospitals here received the bodies in what seemed an unending row, of the young and the old; men, women and children. They all perished in the massive tide that swept away chunks of land, houses and huts, along with belongings, as also parked vehicles parked on the beach.”\n\nIn the fishing villages of Kanyakumari district, more than 400 fishermen and their family members were killed.\n\nHundreds of fishing boats were destroyed or washed out to sea. Another 400 died in Cuddalore district. According to an Associate Press report: “Seawater flooded into the streets of Cuddalore town, flipping over dozens of cars and leaving some vehicles perched on top of the road dividers.”\n\nIn Kakinada town, P. Ramananmurthy told the news agency: “I was shocked to see innumerable fishing boats flying on the shoulder of the waves, going back and forth as if made of paper. Many boats were upturned, but fishermen were still holding onto them. They also were pushed into the sea. I never imagined anything like this could happen.”\n\nThe southern states of Andra Pradesh and Kerala and Pondicherry were also hard hit. The fate of the population on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands is still unclear. The low-lying group of islands was not only directly in the path of the tsunami but was also shaken by a major aftershock. S.B. Deol, Inspector General of Police, told the Indian press: “The situation is very grim. The death toll will go up to at least 1,000.”\n\nAs in previous natural disasters, the Indian government has made statements of concern and promised to provide assistance. The Indian airforce immediately flew to the Andaman Islands, where its base has been severely battered. Two naval ships were also dispatched. But the aid dispatched so far to alleviate the suffering of those left homeless in southern India has been limited. A belated advisory was issued to ships and fishermen to keep away from the coast for 24 hours.\n\nA similar picture is emerging in Indonesia. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) put the latest official death toll at 4,422, but the number is certain to rise. Most of the victims are in the province of Aceh on the northern tip of Sumatra, which has been the target of a huge military operation aimed at crushing separatist rebels and cowering the population. Media coverage in the province has been subject to severe restrictions and censorship for more than a year.\n\nAt least 3,000 of the deaths are in the capital of Banda Aceh, which was hit by the earthquake as well as huge waves. Along the coast, entire villages were swallowed up. Most of the current reports are from Banda Aceh and the east coast. “There are also widespread reports of collapsed buildings in that same region, but as yet, most disturbingly, still no reports at all from Aceh’s west coast, an area around 100km from the quake’s centre, and where damage could be expected to be most severe,” the ABC reported.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Belyuni told the media last night: “We have stopped recovering bodies and will begin again first thing in the morning. It’s possible the death toll will mount because many of the corpses are still caught up trees.” According to Reuters, “TV pictures showed dazed villagers in rural areas carrying their belongings walking past scenes of devastation in Aceh. Buses and cars were overturned on the side of roads, some vehicles partially submerged in water. Thousands of people had been made homeless.”\n\nPresident Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has declared a national disaster and promised aid to the victims. But there is no indication that his administration will in any way ease the current military occupation of the province and anti-democratic restrictions, which will seriously hamper the distribution of assistance to those in need.\n\nOther countries in South and South East Asia have also been seriously affected. At least 310 people have been killed in Thailand, including in southern tourist resorts such as the island of Phuket. More than 1,300 have been injured in six provinces. “We are in chaos,” Somsak Sunwansujarit, deputy director of the county’s disaster department bluntly declared.\n\nIn Malaysia at least 53 people are dead and another 34 are missing after five metre waves battered the east coast of the country. Preliminary reports from Burma indicate at least 10 have died. The government in the Maldives has declared a state of emergency after the tidal wave swept over the islands and flooded two thirds of the capital. The death toll there stands at 15.\n\nIn the extensive coverage of this disaster, the international media and politicians treat the events as a terrible, but unavoidable tragedy. While earthquakes are notoriously difficult to predict, there is no doubt that the extent of the current tragedy could have been significantly lessened if prompt warnings had been issued and emergency aid and supplies prepared.', 'title': 'Devastating tidal wave kills more than 13,000 in southern Asia', 'url': 'https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2004/12/tsun-d27.html', 'keywords': ['water', 'southern', 'areas', 'wave', 'tidal', 'kills', 'devastating', 'killed', 'coast', 'asia', 'tsunami', 'sri', 'india', 'toll', '13000', 'waves'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Devastating tidal wave kills more than 13,000 in southern AsiaBy Peter Symonds27 December 2004A tsunami or tidal wave, triggered by a huge earthquake yesterday off the coast of northwestern Sumatra, has devastated the coastlines of neighbouring countries, killing at least 13,500 people.\nOn the southern tip of the island, 866 were killed in Galle, 250 in Matara and 160 in Weligama.\nWhere are the leaders?”At least 3,000 people were killed in southern India, with the state of Tamil Nadu accounting for over 1,700 dead.\nBut the aid dispatched so far to alleviate the suffering of those left homeless in southern India has been limited.\nAt least 310 people have been killed in Thailand, including in southern tourist resorts such as the island of Phuket.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'Please enable cookies on your web browser in order to continue.\n\nThe new European data protection law requires us to inform you of the following before you use our website:\n\nWe use cookies and other technologies to customize your experience, perform analytics and deliver personalized advertising on our sites, apps and newsletters and across the Internet based on your interests.

"Death came from the sea," Satya Kumari, a construction worker living on the outskirts of the former French enclave of Pondicherry, India, told Reuters. "The waves just kept chasing us. It swept away all our huts. What did we do to deserve this?" The wall of water up to 10 meters (30 ft) tall flattened houses, hurled fishing boats onto coastal roads, sent cars spinning through swirling waters into hotel lobbies and sucked sunbathers, babies and fishermen off beaches and out to sea. Worst affected were Sri Lanka where 4,890 were killed, India where officials reported as many as 5,600 could be dead, northern Indonesia with 4,500 drowned and the southern tourist isles of Thailand where as many as 430 were feared to have lost their lives. Many of the dead were foreign tourists. "This is a massive humanitarian disaster and the communications are so bad we still don\'t know the full scale of it. Unless we get aid quickly to the people many more could die," said Phil Esmond, head of Oxfam in Sri Lanka. The Geneva-based International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said it was seeking 7.5 million Swiss francs ($6.5 million) for emergency aid funding.\n\nThe world\'s biggest earthquake in 40 years hit southern Asia on December 26, 2004, unleashing a tsunami that crashed into Sri Lanka and India, drowning thousands and swamping tourist isles in Thailand and the Maldives.

It was Sri Lanka\'s worst natural disaster in recorded history. Officials expected the death toll to rise as troops recovered bodies dragged out to sea or smashed on golden beaches. ROWS OF DEAD CHILDREN Soldiers in Indonesia searched for bodies in tree tops and in the wreckage of homes smashed by the tsunami, triggered by the 9.0 magnitude earthquake that struck off the coast of northern Sumatra island killing at least 4,491 people there. "It smells so bad ... The human bodies are mixed in with dead animals like dogs, fish, cats and goats," said marine colonel Buyung Lelana, head of an evacuation team in Sumatra\'s Aceh province searching for more dead.

The southern coastal town of Galle, a major industrial hub famed for its historic fort, had been submerged by a 9-meter (30-ft) wave. Weeping relatives scrambled over hundreds of bodies piled in a hospital in nearby Karapitiya, shirts or handkerchiefs clutched over their noses against the stench of decaying bodies. "We are struggling to cope. Bodies are still coming in," said Karapitiya Teaching Hospital administrator Dr H.G. Jayaratne. On India\'s southeast coast, thousands of villagers huddled in emergency shelters, too scared to sleep in case of another wave. "I have been waiting for my husband and brother since yesterday," wept 38-year-old Narasamma as she stood on a beach near Mypadu, a fishing hamlet 600 km (375 miles) south of Hyderabad, capital of southern Andhra Pradesh state.

[Reuters] "We are continuously recovering bodies. We are also seeing wrecked fishing trawlers and boats by the coast," Coast Guard Commandant Navin Chandra Pandey said in New Delhi. One of the most devastated regions was India\'s remote Andaman and Nicobar islands, near the epicenter of the quake and where officials said the tsunami had killed 3,000 people. The toll in the strategic islands, most of which is barred to visitors and home to several primitive tribes, included at least 68 air force personnel and families at a base, officials said. The tourist islands and beaches of southern Thailand lay in the path of the wave that had killed 431.On the Patong tourist beach on the island of Phuket, hotels and restaurants were wrecked and speed boats were rammed into buildings. Belgian tourist Christian Patouraux was on the island of Kho Phi Phi, famed as the site of the Leonardo di Caprio film "The Beach," and said he narrowly escaped the wave. "I saw lots of dead bodies and many injured people, many with cuts and broken bones," he said. The tsunami was so powerful it smashed boats and flooded areas along the east African coast, 6,000 km (3,728 miles) away. In the Maldives, where thousands of foreign visitors were holidaying in the beach paradise, damage appeared to be limited. With communications cut to remote areas, it was impossible to assess the full scale of the disaster, aid agencies said. A tsunami, a Japanese word that translates as "harbor wave," is usually caused by a sudden rise or fall of part of the earth\'s crust under or near the ocean. It comprises a series of waves that can travel across the ocean at speeds of over 800 kph (500 mph). As the tsunami enters the shallows of coastlines in its path, its velocity slows but its height increases and it can strike with devastating force.\n\n\n\n\n\nClose Today\'s Top News Top World News Asia tsunami kills 15,500, rush to find bodies\n\nArmy to crush any Taiwan independence plot\n\nHu sends condolences; relief team ready\n\nAnti-secession law called \'timely\'\n\nAntarctic team halfway to peak\n\nLaw to make officials \'take blame and quit\'\n\nAsian Tsunami kills 14,425, many more homeless UN warns of possible epidemics in quake-hit Asia Yushchenko has unassailable lead in Ukraine poll Israel starts Palestinian prisoner release Iraq rejects U.S. talk of adjusting vote result Hamas\' win in town elections challenges Abbas\n\nAdvertisement', 'title': 'Asia tsunami kills 15,500, rush to find bodies', 'url': 'http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-12/27/content_403688.htm', 'keywords': ['disaster', 'southern', 'wave', 'tourist', 'bodies', 'kills', 'sri', 'tsunami', 'asia', '15500', 'rush', 'dead', 'waves'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Asia tsunami kills 15,500, rush to find bodies(Agencies)Updated: 2004-12-27 16:08 Soldiers searched for bodies in treetops, families wept over the dead laid on beaches and rescuers scoured coral isles for missing tourists as Asia counted the cost Monday of a tsunami that killed more than 15,500.\nOfficials expected the death toll to rise as troops recovered bodies dragged out to sea or smashed on golden beaches.\nWeeping relatives scrambled over hundreds of bodies piled in a hospital in nearby Karapitiya, shirts or handkerchiefs clutched over their noses against the stench of decaying bodies.\n"I saw lots of dead bodies and many injured people, many with cuts and broken bones," he said.\nThe tsunami was so powerful it smashed boats and flooded areas along the east African coast, 6,000 km (3,728 miles) away.', 'date': 1104105600}, {'text': 'Tsunamis: Health effects and WHO action\n\nPhoto: Keystone\n\n30 December 2004 | Geneva - The earthquake and subsequent tsunamis originating in Asia have killed and injured tens of thousands of people and left millions homeless in coastal areas of Asia.

The only protection for a growing coastal population is a warning to evacuate.\n\nA series of Pacific Ocean tsunamis over the last century fueled the establishment of an ocean-wide warning network. But the Indian Ocean, where tsunamis are less common, has no such system. So when earthquake specialists in the United States and elsewhere saw the first signal of the giant Dec. 26 quake, they had no way of knowing whether a tsunami was under way. And even if they had known about the tsunami, they had no way to alert coastal communities that titanic waves were racing at them -- as fast as a jet plane.\n\n\n\nPhoto: Petty Officer 2nd Class Philip A. McDaniel U.S. Navy\n\nSo as the scope of the current disaster began to emerge from drowned beaches and bloated bodies, officials in several nations started discussing a warning network for the Indian Ocean. Japan, source of the word "tsunami, offered to expand the existing Pacific warning network southward, where the Philippines is a tsunami nexus. Australia\'s Foreign Minister, Alexander Downer, said his country was willing to set up a system for the Indian Ocean. And Indian Science and Technology Minister Kapil Sibal promised to emplace up to a dozen undersea monitoring stations in the Indian Ocean within 30 months.\n\nLike the existing system in the North Pacific Ocean, a warning network in the Indian Ocean would need three components:\n\nSensors to detect earthquakes and ocean waves, and computers and scientists to analyze the data and issue warnings. Communications equipment to transmit a warning. Local emergency response teams to translate the warning into quick evacuation.\n\nTsunamis cross the ocean at roughly 500 miles per hour. And because they are caused by underwater earthquakes, which are completely unpredictable, the warning process must be fast -- and accurate. Coastal evacuations cause massive dislocation, and false warnings can be dangerous if they cause people to ignore the next warning.\n\n\n\nFrom USGS\n\nWave warnings\n\nThe Why Files asked Paul Whitmore, scientist in charge at the West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center, about the warning process. He said detecting tsunamis and issuing the warning was the easy part: It\'s much harder to alert people in vulnerable shorelines in the minutes or hours before a tsunami strikes. Indeed, the Alaska-West Coast center urges coastal residents to seek higher ground whenever they feel a strong quake, without waiting for a warning.\n\nThe first inkling of a tsunami occurs when an instrument called a seismometer detects a strong underwater earthquake. Within five to 10 minutes, Whitmore says, a tsunami center will issue a warning, even though it can not yet be sure a giant wave exists. (Tsunamis largely result from vertical earthquake motion, so some underwater quakes don\'t trigger tsunamis.)\n\n\n\nGraph: IRIS\n\nThe confirmation of a tsunami must come from an instrument that measures real waves. In the Pacific, about 125 coastal tide gauges measure wave height and radio data to the tsunami warning network. Confirmation is critical, Whitmore says, because it can be used to cancel a warning. In the tsunami warning business, crying wolf is dangerous. "Every now and then, we get a sequence of big earthquakes in Alaska and have to call a warning, and we\'ll get a minor tsunami or none at all."\n\nPhoto: NOAA\n\nWhitmore says it could take "a couple of years" to build an Indian Ocean system "if they try to start from scratch." He suggests that existing tide gauges in the Indian Ocean may be used for a warning network if they are equipped to send data by radio. Whitmore also advises taking advantage of the existing warning infrastructure in the Pacific. While some new ocean sensors would be needed in the Indian Ocean, seismic information is already available, and existing computers and programs could crunch the new data.\n\nThe data crunching, at least at first, could be done at centers in Japan, Alaska or Hawaii, he suggests. "There is something nice about having the tsunami warning center right in the vicinity, and that should be the long-term goal, but by utilizing existing systems, they could do it faster."\n\n-- David Tenenbaum\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\nTsunami Warning Center\n\nMap of the world\'s quakes\n\nRelated Why Files\n\nTsunami!\n\nEarthquake!\n\nVolcano!', 'title': 'Warning of Tsunamis', 'url': 'https://whyfiles.org/shorties/168tsunami_warn/', 'keywords': ['existing', 'whitmore', 'network', 'pacific', 'tsunami', 'tsunamis', 'indian', 'ocean', 'coastal', 'waves', 'warning'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'A series of Pacific Ocean tsunamis over the last century fueled the establishment of an ocean-wide warning network.\nBut the Indian Ocean, where tsunamis are less common, has no such system.\nJapan, source of the word "tsunami, offered to expand the existing Pacific warning network southward, where the Philippines is a tsunami nexus.\nFrom USGSWave warningsThe Why Files asked Paul Whitmore, scientist in charge at the West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center, about the warning process.\nIn the Pacific, about 125 coastal tide gauges measure wave height and radio data to the tsunami warning network.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'Asian tsunami toll mounts to over 28,000\n\n(Agencies)\n\nUpdated: 2004-12-28 17:02\n\nAid agencies struggled on Tuesday to cope with the enormity of the Asian tsunami disaster which has killed more than 28,000, with the International Red Cross saying it may have to treble its appeal for funds.\n\n\n\nVideo grab shows a tidal wave in Penang after tsunami waves hit southern Asia on Sunday in this amateur video footage taken December 26, 2004.

The sea is a Pacific influence and you perhaps dip your toe in the water. But before you realise whatâ€™s happening, you are caught in one of the worst natural calamities in living memory. For hundreds in Chennaiâ€™s Marina Beach on Sunday morning, it was nightmarishly like this.For thousands of fisherfolk, who had gone like every morning into the sea, it was again the same story â€” suddenly being caught in a phenomenon, tsunami, which struck India for the first time in recorded history.The country was still coming to grips with the nature and scale of the disaster. The toll, according to the government, was 2,000 and rising, but other estimates put the toll at over 3,000. And thereâ€™s no news yet of 45,000 people in Car Nicobar and Greater Nicobar where a quake of 7.5 magnitude hit early in the morning.The trigger for the tsunami â€” a destructive wave train created by an undersea disturbance â€” was an 8.9 magnitude earthquake, just off the northern tip of Indonesia\'\'s Sumatra island.There were a series of aftershocks, creating mammoth waves that hit coastal Tamil Nadu, where the toll was the highest, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Pondicherry. Orissa and West Bengal escaped relatively unscathed, with only two deaths reported till evening.Over a thousand deaths are feared in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, with extensive damage to the airport at Car Nicobar, just 115 nautical miles (about 300 km) from Sumatra, and Campbell Bay.The airport at Port Blair was damaged too, but a couple of flights took off later with fleeing tourists. Many more are still stranded.In Tamil Nadu, the toll is expected to touch 2,500, with one report putting the figure at over 1,000 in Nagapattinam district alone.

Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao left Beijing Wednesday for Indonesia to attend the international conference on how to cope with the aftermath of the devastating tsunami.

[Reuters]\n\n\n\nAs aid workers struggle to feed and shelter millions of survivors who are still burying their dead 10 days after a tsunami killed 150,000 people, world leaders will meet on Thursday to seek an answer for the question -- how can the world prevent such a catastrophe ever occurring again? Indonesia, the worst-hit nation with almost two-thirds of the dead, hopes the one-day summit will agree to set up a regional tsunami warning system, which experts say could have saved many lives. Leaders from 26 nations and humanitarian organizations will also look at the massive reconstruction needed to rebuild the shattered lives of millions of people in six Indian Ocean nations. "Tomorrow\'s conference is not only for Indonesia but for all countries that have suffered from the earthquake," said Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. "And of course we do hope that tomorrow there will be a concrete result in the mechanism of how to assist countries that are to be assisted." Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said coordinating the aid effort was a key agenda item.\n\nIndonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono speaks on his mobile phone during his inspection of the Jakarta Convention Centre January 5, 2005 where the international tsunami summit will be held on Thursday.

[Reuters] "This will make a major contribution to ensuring there is a better coordinated effort and there are stronger contributions than might be the case without a summit." The world has pledged $2.278 billion in aid as hundreds of tons of emergency supplies of medicines, food, clean water and shelter floods into tsunami-hit areas by air, sea and road. DEBT FREEZE Annan is expected to announce a major U.N. tsunami appeal at the Jakarta conference, which will also discuss the possibility of an immediate freeze of debt payments by affected countries. But some analysts say concrete long-term rehabilitation and reconstruction plans depend on detailed assessments difficult to make at a time when thousands of the dead are not yet buried and some isolated areas have only just been reached. The International Monetary Fund has said calculating the economic impact of the disaster would have to wait until immediate humanitarian needs are met. The relief effort has faced enormous hurdles. The giant waves destroyed hospitals, damaged airports and washed away roads and bridges. And the sheer number of aid organizations flooding into Asia, big and small, has posed coordination problems and created bottlenecks.\n\nIndonesian police from the mobile brigade guard a Jakarta street January 5, 2005 near the Convention Centre where the international tsunami summit will be held on Thursday.

[Reuters] "I think what we really want to do is make sure the money that has been pledged and the resources that are on the way are properly and appropriately distributed to deal with the need," Secretary of State Colin Powell said on Tuesday after he arrived in Jakarta. The United Nations latest report on the relief operation said a lack of trucks, aircraft, boats, warehouses and operating airstrips were holding up aid to survivors around the Indian Ocean rim. It also cited a lack of coordination among aid groups. Scores of military aircraft and navy ships and thousands of troops from the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore, India, Germany and Japan deployed to tsunami relief have sped up the relief operation in recent days. U.S. Seahawk helicopters buzz in and out of Banda Aceh, the devastated provincial capital of Indonesia\'s Aceh province, ferrying aid to isolated survivors. Giant military transport planes disgorge emergency supplies, including military field hospitals, needed to treat hundreds of badly injured whose wounds are now becoming infected. Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda said the tsunami disaster meant an Indonesian proposal for an ASEAN standby military force to deal with humanitarian disasters should now be acted on. RAINS, PIRACY In Sri Lanka, the second-hardest hit nation, rains that had caused fresh flooding and bogged down trucks, let up and the United Nations said many districts were now accessible by main roads, except for parts of the country\'s east coast. In Indonesia, aid groups struggled to reach areas for the first time since the Dec. 26 tsunami. They were using boats to search for survivors on the west coast of Sumatra, an island the size of Florida, but many small ports have been destroyed or badly damaged. The United Nations latest report on Indonesian relief efforts said there had been reports of piracy off Sumatra\'s west and east coasts. Aid groups were also turning their attention to the longer term reconstruction effort. "It is our experience in previous emergencies donors want their money spent immediately. What everyone has to understand is that it is going to take years to rebuild what these people have lost," said A. John Watson, president of CARE Canada.\n\n\n\nClose Today\'s Top News Top World News World leaders in Jakarta for tsunami crisis talks\n\nPLA troops active in tsunami relief\n\nUS$3 million private aid ready for victims\n\nUS military denies arrest of al-Zarqawi\n\nChina pledges to work on yuan reform\n\nChinese main guests at N.Korea casino\n\nWorld leaders in Jakarta for tsunami crisis talks Tsunami aid operation stumbles Vietnam\'s suspected bird flu case died Annan shakes up top UN staff Abbas assails \'Zionist enemy\' after tank kills 7 U.S. military prefers Indonesian aid to Iraq war\n\nAdvertisement', 'title': 'World leaders in Jakarta for tsunami crisis talks', 'url': 'http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-01/05/content_406206.htm', 'keywords': ['disaster', 'relief', 'military', 'aid', 'crisis', 'tsunami', 'international', 'talks', 'world', 'countries', 'jakarta', 'leaders'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': "World leaders in Jakarta for tsunami crisis talks(Agencies)Updated: 2005-01-05 15:28 U.N.

This is in addition to the current estimated death toll of 150,000. And the region faces a further “health disaster” if access to clean drinking water is not resumed soon, the agency says.\n\nBetween three and five million people are without access to basic resources such as clean water, shelter, food, sanitation and healthcare after the world’s most powerful earthquake in 40 years shook the region and generated a colossal tsunami. The wave hit coastal regions in 12 countries in total, with Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and Thailand the worst affected.\n\nBut fears are growing that the surviving populations are now at risk of disease outbreaks. “Millions of people are now under serious threat as a result of damaged water and sanitation systems, sea water contamination and the congested and crowded conditions of the displaced,” warns a WHO situation report, published on 3 January.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“A potential death toll of 50,000 due to diarrhoea and other disease is not at all unreasonable,” warned David Nabarro, a senior WHO official, on Saturday.\n\n“That’s absolutely feasible,” agrees Valerie Curtis, an epidemiologist and hygiene specialist, and director of the Hygiene Centre at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK. “That’s the worst case scenario.”\n\nOvercrowded shelters\n\nNo official epidemics have been declared but hundreds of cases of acute diarrhoea are being reported in Thailand and the Maldives. Survivors living in overcrowded temporary shelters are also at particular risk of acute respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, warns the WHO. “But diarrhoea alone can kill a child in a few hours if they are dehydrated,” says Fadela Chaib, a WHO spokeswoman.\n\nCurtis cautions that a “knee-jerk reaction” to such disaster scenarios is to concentrate on providing pure drinking water. “Sanitation and hygiene is the issue,” she told New Scientist.\n\n“Most of the water is coming from high ground, and is probably not affected by the tsunami,” she says. “Providing soap and water for washing hands is vastly more important than providing pure clean water, unless you know the water is contaminated by sewage.”\n\nDiarrhoea is a symptom of gastroenteric diseases, caused by about 20 different organisms. These are spread through contact with human faeces. One common cause is Shigella, says Curtis. This has a very low infectious threshold – “you don’t need many organisms to fall sick”. Others include Campylobacter, Escherichia coli and Salmonella. Research by her team has shown that hand washing can cut the risk of transmission by 47%.\n\nYoung and old\n\nNick Beeching, a consultant in infectious disease at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, UK, says that the young and very old will be most at risk from the effects of waterborne diseases because they are least able to tolerate the dehydration which comes with diseases which cause vomiting.\n\n“At the moment there is not enough clean water to rehydrate them,” he says. “Sadly this means that a lot of people are going to die of illnesses which would not normally be life threatening.”\n\nThe WHO has also warned that overcrowded conditions will increased the risk of measles, influenza and meningitis outbreaks. It recommends that measles vaccines be given immediately to all infants and children between six and 59 months of age.\n\nCampaigns have already started in Sri Lanka and the south Indian state of Kerala. “Measles is a deadly threat to children living in crowded camps,” says Marzio Babille, UNICEF’s chief of health in India. “It spreads quickly, killing children, or severely weakens their immune systems. Those children are then too weak to fight off other diseases, leading to more deaths. It’s a vicious circle. But we can head it off with a good round of immunisation and vitamin A.”\n\nCholera and typhoid – spread through contaminated water – are also a concern, but mass vaccination is not needed says the WHO. “The most practical and effective strategy to prevent cholera and typhoid is to provide clean water and adequate sanitation,” it says.

Elizabeth Dalziel \x95 Associated Press Dazed and weeping survivors began taking stock of their losses from Sunday\'s catastrophe. In India, they buried victims in mass graves. In Indonesia, some of the dead dangled from trees, where they had been deposited by 30-foot swells. The rampaging water washed away entire villages, capsized boats and sucked cars and trucks out to sea.\n\n"We basically saw the town disappear in front of us," said Nick Hanbury, 48, a Briton who was vacationing in the Sri Lankan resort town of Galle when a giant wave struck.\n\nRelief officials launched a massive international aid effort.

Emergency Relief Coordinator Jan Egeland said in New York.\n\nHe warned that the cost of the disaster could be in "the many billions of dollars" and appealed to other countries to give generously to forestall disease that could threaten the lives of millions of survivors.\n\nThe tsunami struck without warning and took the lives of rich and poor, locals and tourists, even a member of the Thai royal family. Poomi Jensen, 21, the Thai-American grandson of King Bhumibol Adulyadej and a former resident of San Diego, was last seen jet-skiing off the popular Thai resort area of Krabi. His body was found later by rescue workers, Reuters news agency reported.\n\nOther reports said a disproportionate share of the dead appeared to be children, who may have lacked the wherewithal to escape the tsunami.\n\n"Many women and children died because they could not run fast enough," said Jur Mahali, 29, as he stood near a spot in Kadaymani, Indonesia, where he said three children perished.

As the sea floor buckled, a colossal surge of water radiated out, reaching the speed of a passenger jet before eventually striking land.

"It\'s just devastating, and all this happening to innocent, poor people."\n\nThe International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies put the 10-nation death toll at 23,710, but said nearly 5,000 people were missing and that the number of dead would surely rise. The Swiss-based organization also said that more than\n\n1 million people had been displaced and more than 200,000 had lost their homes.\n\nAuthorities in the stricken countries offered their own counts of the dead: 12,500 in Sri Lanka, 7,000 in India, about 5,000 in Indonesia, more than 900 in Thailand, 60 in Malaysia, 43 in the Maldives, 34 in Myanmar, three in the Seychelles and two in Bangladesh.

Mass inoculations for children also will be needed.\n\n"The aftermath potentially could kill as many people as the tsunamis itself," he said.\n\nTo stave off contamination, officials in Cuddalore, India, began burying bodies in pits, foregoing the usual Hindu cremation ceremony. Sri Lankans skipped the time-consuming routine of identifying bodies, instead taking photographs before burying them. Relatives will be asked to identify the bodies from the pictures later.\n\nIn Banda Aceh, the area of Indonesia hit hardest by the quake and tsunami, bodies were still lying today by the roadsides and on the grounds of the city\'s grand mosque.

For Leupueng, the question of emergency aid is irrelevant. How can you send aid to a town that has ceased to exist? But every day scores of survivors and relatives of the dead and missing make the hard journey to this place. Some say they are looking for the bodies of loved ones; others hope they might meet family members now coming down from the hills.\n\nThe tragedy of Leupueng is not only that buildings and lives have been destroyed but that every home has been destroyed. There are no reference points to rebuild the town. Some locals who returned on Friday not only failed to find their relatives, dead or alive, but failed even to identify the places where their homes had stood. It is believed fewer than one-tenth of the town\'s inhabitants - between 200 and 700 people - escaped.\n\nThey are just some of the many in Aceh who have no shelter, no food and no electricity. The wells villagers depend on are now filled with brackish water. Bodies are still caught in the debris and diseases such as cholera, typhus, malaria, diarrhoea and pneumonia are becoming a serious threat. From the air it is clear that the entire coastline has altered.

The nuclear station withstood the devastation of the Big Wave because it is not even imaginable what would have happened had the tsunami damaged the two nuclear power units situated on the shore.\n\nL V Krishnan, former director, safety research and health physics at the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research at Kalpakkam, explains how the great disaster was forestalled because of scientific planning.\n\nA veteran of the Department of Atomic Energy for 40 years, he retired from Kalpakkam nine years ago and is a well-known safety expert on nuclear plants. For many years, Krishnan, has been closely associated with the Kalpakkam nuclear power generating plants. He continues to advise DAE in selective matters. He visited Kalpakkam immediately after the tsunami hit the town killing 56 people including 5 nuclear scientists.\n\nIn an interview to Senior Editor Sheela Bhatt, he not only gives his account of how the Kalpakkam nuclear power plant withstood the tsunami but also suggests how India's nuclear assets can be protected in the case of a similar disaster.\n\nWas a tsunami taken into consideration when the Kalpakkam nuclear power reactors were being built?\n\nNo, tsunami was not taken into consideration. Nowhere in India people had thought a tsunami could strike the Indian coasts. But we had taken into account the worst cyclonic storm surges. Before a cyclone hits, a storm surge comes. We had provided for the worst cyclone that could hit the coast looking at historical statistics.\n\nThe maximum water level that could be expected if the cyclone coincided with highest of high tides was estimated at 6 metres or so. The Kalpakkam plant site is built to withstand that. The construction of Kalpakkam began in about 1968 but it was completed in 1983 because around 1974 outside help was discontinued and we found that we will have to build the plant indigenously and that took some time.\n\nThe first unit of Kalpakkam was commissioned in 1983 and the second was commissioned in 1984. Since then, it is functioning extremely well.\n\nThe tsunami storm surge that we saw on that day was not much more than that, in fact it (intensity of tsunami storm surge) was less than that!\n\nReally?\n\nYes. These nuclear reactors, for cooling purposes, draw water from the sea; that is why they are located in the coastal area.\n\nIn Kalpakkam, half a kilometre into the sea there is a huge well that has been dug. That well is connected to another well on the shore on land. These two wells are connected by an under seabed tunnel. As the storm surge comes in and the water level rises in the well in the sea, the level of water also rises in the well on the shore.\n\nThe moment the water level rises beyond prescribed limits in the well on the shore, the seawater pump trips. The moment it trips the operator sitting in the control room knows that something is wrong and he trips the reactors.\n\nEven before the wave hits the shore, I would say, that the reactors were shut down. Imagine if the waves would have been higher than what was anticipated by planners and if they would have come in, then, what would have happened to the reactors? Nothing at all.\n\nThe well in the sea and well on the shore are also connected by a jetty. On the shore there is a horizontally spread building that has turbines installed inside. Behind the turbine building lie the domes of two reactors. Even if the tsunami waters had come in they would have hit the turbine building first, not the reactors. And the reactor buildings have walls that are one metre thick (http://www.npcil.org/maps.asp). So even if waves had affected the site, sea water simply could not have entered the reactors. The reactors are pretty safe. It so happened that this time the water didn't even enter the turbine building. Even the turbine building is so designed that the ground level is sufficiently raised to withstand earthquakes and storms.\n\nAlso, all our reactors have a buffer zone of one-and-a-half kilometres between residential localities and the reactor building. If that buffer zone had existed in Bhopal, the death toll would not have been so high. I know from my experiences that district collectors are worried more about oil refineries than the nuclear reactors' safety measures.\n\nWhat were the reasons for the high number of casualties in Kalpakkam?\n\nThe casualties were not at the plant site at all. The causalities were in the township. In the construction of the township we have not taken into account all of these things.\n\nWhy?\n\nWe had no fears of radiation there. Second, as I said we had not anticipated a tsunami. As far as a cyclone is concerned, one always gets advanced warning. But in the case of a tsunami if you don't have any advanced warning, the sea comes in silently. Many more people would have died if the tsunami had hit at 5 am instead of 9 am.\n\nWhat kind of earthquakes did you take into account when the final designs were made?\n\nAll earthquakes don't cause tsunamis. Certainly we didn't take into account earthquakes of a magnitude of 8 or more. While planning, we take more into account the earthquakes on land. We thought the fault line near Indonesia is quite far away from the Indian coast. Also, historical statistical data didn't suggest that a magnitude of 9 is a possibility and we didn't anticipate it.\n\nAfter this event I have read only two reports on the historical data of tsunami in the Indian context. R N Iyengar, professor at the Indian Institute of Science, said on November 28, 1945, Pasni, a trading town about 100 kms from Mekhran, was washed away by a wave of about 15 meters, after an earthquake measuring 6.7 on the Richter scale hit the coast which is now in Pakistan. But that could not have been the basis of our designers in Kalpakkam. Another report claimed that a tsunami once hit some parts of Bangladesh.\n\nIs Kalpakkam absolutely safe after the tsunami?\n\nIt is safe. I visited the plant site two days after the tsunami hit us. Water had come in some places but it had just wet the ground. It didn't enter the building, it came just outside it. There are two reactor units in the Madras Atomic Power Station at Kalpakkam. One unit was already shut down for maintenance and the other was operating and the sea water pump house of that unit had registered the higher level of water.\n\nAdjacent to the Madras Atomic Power Station a new fast breeder reactor is under construction. To make such vital buildings withstand earthquakes, first a large concrete base mat is built. So if the structure moves it will move all together without getting cracked. On the location of the fast breeder reactor they had dug up a huge area several metres below the ground level for the base mat. Sea water have flooded that place. Now, they will have to pump out the waters and start construction again.\n\nThe operator of the operating nuclear reactor unit was alert which saved the situation. Right? What about the people in the pump house?\n\nThere is no need to have operators present in the pump house all the time. Once the water level goes up there are water level indicators that trip the pump. And once the pump trips the reactors have to be shut down. As the water level rose in the well on the shore, the pump tripped and the operator saw it and he tripped the reactors. The operator's action is automatic.\n\nHow is the situation at the Kudankulam Atomic Power Project?\n\nI have not been there but Mr S K Jain, chairman and managing director of the Nuclear Power Corporation of India, was present at Kudankulam when the tsunami struck. The Kudankulam Atomic Power Project is under construction with the help of Russian scientists and he said the same thing -- that none of the building is affected.\n\nIf somehow the water had entered the turbines building what would have happened\n\nIn the turbine hall there is no radioactivity. The turbines are at a high level. Waters could only enter in the condensers and not in turbines. Now, if any part of the entire system is affected reactors will automatically shut down. And once the reactors stop functioning there is no risk.\n\nAnd if tsunami waves would have entered the nuclear reactors building, then?\n\nThere is no way waters could get into the reactors buildings. The reactor will shut down automatically before water enters the building. The in-built system is such. We know nature is mighty. But we know the upper limit of what all nature can do. At least we can estimate. I agree scientists didn't anticipate a tsunami so the devastation has followed. But the cyclone was well anticipated and was taken into account. We anticipate something and then built the building. In Japan earthquakes are common but their nuclear reactors are safe and ongoing because of their designs of structures. Because man can anticipate safety is possible.\n\nBut we cannot even think of a scenario if a tsunami had hit it badly.\n\nYes. We too think like laymen and ask questions. Somebody designs the reactors. Another group builds it. And another group which is independent of it keeps asking questions as you do. What if the instrument fails? What if the operator makes mistakes? What if the back-up system fails too? We make sure that even if all these errors occur together the reactors will not release radioactive material.\n\nSince the tsunami has hit India so badly that doubts keep rising about the safety issue?\n\nThe tsunami has hit India in the most vulnerable part. But if you are well protected you are safe. It so happened that our plants were well protected but our township was not so we lost 30 people. We didn't anticipate a tsunami but we anticipated a cyclone of this nature and it helped us tremendously. This time the velocity of water may not be as much as it is during cyclones but the volume of water was tremendous. See, the cyclone will have much higher wind speed as well. In Kalpakkam, the massive turbine building is able to protect the reactors.\n\nI can assure you on the safety of Kalpakkam because often I am asked to assess the safety by the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board. I cannot afford to be lax on safety issue. I have to speak honestly.\n\nI don't see any problem at Kalpakkam in the post-tusnami period too. I don't know however, what will be the case if an earthquake of magnitude 10 occurs in the Sumatra region. It is not enough to anticipate an earthquake, it is not enough to predict that an earthquake can cause a tsunami. It is also necessary to find out the impact of the tsunami along the coastline.\n\nIf you have an earthquake there, its effects may not be uniform everywhere on our coast. Along the coastline the depths of the sea are different. At some places sand gets piled up forming contours. The depths can be shallow there. The energy of the tsunami waves can be focused differently at particular point because depth varies along the coastline.\n\nIn India's coastline, the intensity of the tsunami is variable at different points along the coastline. Now, it is important to find out if there is likelihood of magnified impact because of the contour of the seabed underwater. Now the measurement of depth in the sea is necessary.\n\nThe bathymetric data of the sea ahould be available. We need to have it now to estimate wave heights and design accordingly. India will have to measure the depth of the sea and contours on the seabed. Then, we will be able to project the severity of waves and its impact at any particular point.\n\nWhat will be your advice for the other power plants now?\n\nI am sure the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board will begin a review of the safety aspects. It is their objective. Every event of the country where unforeseen things have occurred, they assess and take corrective steps if necessary.\n\nEven in our reactors when some surprises are noticed or when some component fails, immediately we shut down all other reactors which may have similar components. Only when we have understood why it failed, we restart the reactors. This is a common practice, everywhere in the world.\n\nIn this case, an earthquake of magnitude 9 will have to be taken into account. The mean return period of earthquakes of these magnitudes will be calculated. If something is likely to happen in the next thousands years we take that into account.\n\nBut something is likely to re-occur in say the next 5,000 years, you have to give less importance because somewhere you have to draw a line. On the basis of historical data, we will have to project the future of tsunami re-occurrences and also have to look at the possibility of an earthquake measuring 9.5. This is called extreme value analysis.\n\nAs I told you we will have to take into account seabed contours and its effect on the tsunami wave height. I am sure AERB will re-examine seismic designs of all the vital structures. Importantly, we will have to review the communication network.\n\nMeanwhile, what we can do best is to observe also the movement of the seabed. There we should have buoys that have sensors on the seabed. If the seabed sensors move up because of earthquakes then they immediately relay the information to you. We don't have this system yet.\n\nWe should also be prepared for the events we cannot anticipate. We didn't anticipate a magnitude of 9. It's a huge earthquake. The fault lines off Sumatra extend from 2 degree to 10 degree north latitude. All along the fault line there is a disruption. It's mind-boggling. Nobody disputes that nature is superior to man but preparedness is possible. Safety is a question of attitude. When I visited Kalpakkam, scientists were happy that the design has withstood the tsunami and the reactors could be brought back in line.

In Sri Lanka alone the death toll is 10,029. And when disease breaks out there are fears that aid agencies will struggle to cope. Last night, a spokeswoman for the UN\'s relief agency, Yvette Stevens, said the challenge before the world was unprecedented. "We are used to dealing with disasters in one country. But I think something like this spread across many countries and islands is unprecedented," she said.\n\nAustralia has pledged an initial $10 million in aid and promised to send more money and supplies. The European Union announced an initial €3 million ($5.3 million), and the Red Cross called for $US6.5 million ($8.4 million) for emergency aid funding.

An emergency officer with Christian Aid, Dominic Nutt, said: "We\'ve had reports already from the south of India of bodies rotting where they have fallen, and that will immediately affect the water supply."\n\nThe disaster is not the biggest in terms of how many people have died, the death toll falling well short of the 255,000 who died in the Tangshan quake in China in 1976, but its sheer spread will stretch aid agencies to the fullest. Some affected areas have had communications cut, others are so remote it is impossible to know the extent of the damage, which could severely hamper the relief effort. The head of Oxfam in Sri Lanka, Phil Esmond, said: "This is a massive humanitarian disaster, and the communications are so bad we still don\'t know the full scale of it. Unless we get aid quickly to the people many more could die." The Red Cross said the biggest health challenges faced were "the spread of waterborne diseases, particularly malaria and diarrhoea, as well as respiratory tract infections".\n\nThe US said it would pitch in with the relief work, with similar offers coming from Russia, Britain and Kuwait, among others. The US President, George Bush, sent his condolences for the "terrible loss of life" and the Prime Minister, John Howard, promised Australia "will do everything we can as a regional neighbour".

Meanwhile, millions of people around the Indian Ocean are scrambling for food and clean water, with disease and hunger now the main threat stalking survivors of the most devastating tsunami on record. As the biggest relief operation in history cranked up, Australia boosted its contribution to ravaged areas by sending more aid - army engineers, helicopters and medical staff - to Indonesia.\n\nAnnouncing the new deployments yesterday, the Prime Minister, John Howard, described the disaster as "a human tragedy of mammoth proportions, the likes of which I don\'t think any of us have seen in peacetime before". Australia is co-ordinating its relief efforts with the US, Japan and India. Mr Howard said the four countries would exchange information and pool their assessments of what was needed.\n\nHMAS Kanimbla will leave Sydney at 6pm today bound for Darwin, where it will pick up the engineering detachment and heavy equipment to help with clean-up and rebuilding efforts in the devastated Sumatran province of Aceh. Australia has already sent four C-130 Hercules and one Boeing 707 transport aircraft with medical personnel to the area. Indonesia has also accepted Australia\'s offer of a 55-bed field hospital, which will be set up in Aceh and staffed by 90 personnel, including doctors, nurses and medical technical staff. Three Iroquois helicopters, which will arrive on Monday, are being transported by a chartered Antonov AN-124 heavy-lift aircraft. This is in addition to a light aircraft that was deployed to Indonesia yesterday to help with searches and carry humanitarian assistance into small airstrips in more remote areas.\n\nThe Foreign Minister, Alexander Downer, said the Government would have to dip into the budget surplus to provide extra aid, because the disaster fund would not be big enough to deal with the crisis. Mr Howard said Australia would "need to do a lot more in the months ahead", because of second-wave effects of the tragedy, particularly health and disease control.\n\nThe Chief Medical Officer, John Horvath, warned Australians to avoid unnecessary travel to the affected countries, because of the imminent risk of waterborne disease. Mr Howard urged Australians in devastated areas such as Phuket to leave unless they had pressing reasons to stay. As conditions deteriorated around the region, David Nabarro, who heads the World Health Organisation\'s health crisis team, said: "Perhaps as many as 5 million people are not able to access what they need for living. Either they cannot get water, or their sanitation is inadequate or they cannot get food." Australia\'s latest relief contributions come on top of the Government\'s $35 million aid commitment. Mr Howard said more would be added to this.\n\nUS President George Bush, meanwhile, rebuked critics who have complained he was too slow to react to the disaster, and too "stingy" with the US aid package. Mr Bush, who is on holiday at his ranch in Texas and waited four days before calling a news conference to offer sympathy to survivors, said the US gave $US2.4 billion in food, cash and humanitarian relief to cover the disasters this year. This represented 40 per cent of all relief aid given in the world in 2004, he said. The US was "a very generous, kind-hearted nation".\n\nIn the latest crisis the US has pledged $35 million in aid as a start. The Pentagon is sending the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, a helicopter carrier and a submarine to Sumatra. So far countries have pledged $US220 million in cash. As the hunt continued for survivors, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade yesterday put the official death toll of Australian citizens and permanent residents at 10.\n\nOfficials have established there were 9000 Australians in countries the tsunami hit. But while nearly 5500 have not yet been accounted for, only 1000 Australians are believed to have been in areas the tsunami struck directly. In Aceh province, survivors complained aid was only trickling in despite a mountain of supplies stacking up at the airport. Aid officials blamed poor co-ordination with the military.', 'title': 'Tsunami toll tops 120,000', 'url': 'https://www.smh.com.au/world/asia/tsunami-toll-tops-120-000-20041231-gdkeps.html', 'keywords': ['mr', '120000', 'relief', 'medical', 'aid', 'tops', 'australians', 'tsunami', 'australia', 'toll', 'howard', 'million', 'survivors', 'countries'], 'tags': {'Column 8', 'Socceroos', 'Good Weekend', 'Quizzes', 'Horoscopes', 'Letters', 'For subscribers', 'Editorial', 'Obituaries'}, 'summary': 'Mr Howard said the four countries would exchange information and pool their assessments of what was needed.\nMr Howard urged Australians in devastated areas such as Phuket to leave unless they had pressing reasons to stay.\nMr Howard said more would be added to this.\nThis represented 40 per cent of all relief aid given in the world in 2004, he said.\nOfficials have established there were 9000 Australians in countries the tsunami hit.', 'date': 1104451200}, {'text': 'New Delhi, December 29\n\nThe fate of 2,000-odd families of Sikh ex-servicemen from Punjab and Haryana, living in Campbell Bay, or Mini Punjab as it is popularly known, on the southernmost island of Nicobar is uncertain even as Navy and Coast Guard personnel continue rescue and relief operations.\n\nCampbell Bay and Nicobar Island are the nearest points to Sumatra in Indonesia, which was the epicentre of the earthquake leading to the killer ocean waves or Tsunamis.\n\nAccording to reports, Nicobar Island and Campbell Bay have suffered infrastructural damages with the water having entered the landing strip at Nicobar Island.\n\nThe Inspector General of Police of Nicobar, Mr S.B. Deol, told The Tribune over telephone from Port Blair that Punjabi settlers could be among the six casualties reported from Campbell Bay. An estimated 10000 people are dead, missing or seriously injured elsewhere.\n\n\x93Campbell Bay is at an elevation and higher ground was available, so the casualty figure is low otherwise one in five persons in Nicobar and Little Andaman with an estimated population of 50,000 to 60,000 are feared dead,\x94 Mr Deol said.\n\nThe Navy and the Coast Guard, he said, were extremely active in rescue and relief operations in the islands. Food packets were being dropped and the seriously injured taken aboard a ship for emergency medical attention.\n\nSpread over a 1,500 square kilometer area, Campbell Bay is home to ex-servicemen who were settled there in the 1970s by late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to protect the island from illegal poachers and to ostensibly maintain an Indian presence on the island.\n\nThe Chairman and Managing Director of the Delhi Transport and Tourism Development Corporation, Mr Ramesh Negi, who has served as a Deputy Commissioner in Nicobar, said that the Sikhs have become an inalienable part of the island\x92s history.\n\n\x93The government wanted to settle people from the mainland in Campbell Bay to avoid any dispute over Indian territory and ex-servicemen were the obvious choice because they were trained soldiers...this would also serve to deter illegal poachers,\x94 Mr Negi said.\n\nAccordingly, the government gave 10 acres to every ex-serviceman who was settled in Campbell Bay and money to buy tractor and other equipment for agriculture. In a few years\x92 time, the farming folk had established a gurdwara on the island.\n\n\x93It was like a mini Punjab... there were ex-servicemen from other states also but a majority of them were from Punjab and Haryana. They would celebrate Baisakhi and prepare Makke ki Roti and Sarson da Saag like they do in Punjab,\x94 he recalled.\n\nBesides, the Sikhs have held the posts of sarpanches of the two panchayats in Campbell Bay. Incidentally, the first person to establish contact with the Jarwa tribe inhabiting the Andaman and Nicobar Islands was also a Sikh.\n\n\x93This Sikh gentleman who went by the name of Bakhtawar Singh had great relations with the Jarwas and could speak their language. For many years he was the only contact between the administration and the Jarawa tribe,\x94 Mr Negi recalled.\n\nThe contribution of the Sikh women to the island\x92s development was no less.

"Based on our preliminary investigation, the explosion was caused by a car bomb just in front of the embassy, as we found some parts of a totally damaged car at the scene," General Bachtiar said. The huge bomb blew out windows up to 30 storeys above street level in at least 10 office towers that surround the embassy and left a huge crater near the heavy security gates where people queue each morning before being allowed to enter.\n\nSecurity staff who man the entrance, people in the queue and passers-by are believed to account for most of the dead and injured. A female security officer told Metro TV: "What I saw in the front was nobody left alive because it happened right in front of the gate and the security people were there. There was no place to escape." Yesterday\'s blast appears to have been bigger than the one that killed a dozen people at the JW Marriott Hotel 13 months ago - it blew out windows more than a kilometre away and was heard more than five kilometres away.\n\nLeaders in Jakarta and Australia condemned the attack. Without reference to the Madrid train bombings which took place in the last days of an election campaign in which, as in Australia, the governing and opposition parties had conflicting policies on the war in Iraq, the Prime Minister, John Howard, vowed that Australia would not be intimidated by acts of terrorism. Describing the perpetrators as "evil and barbaric", the Opposition Leader, Mark Latham, committed the Labor Party to support all efforts by the Australian and Indonesian governments to "deal with them as harshly and as quickly as possible".\n\nCampaigning for the Australian election has been halted for two days. Eyewitnesses described office blocks peeled open like sardine tins, and a normally bustling thoroughfare littered with body parts and debris.\n\nA tower of smoke hung over the capital as survivors carried wounded friends and colleagues to safety. Others, still dazed, searched for workmates and family members while the bodies of a man and a woman lay in the street, under a cover of newspaper and yellow emergency tarpaulins. Harold Crouch, an Australian National University Indonesia expert, who was in the embassy when the bomb exploded, said: "The front door was blown off. There was glass and debris everywhere. Things were hanging loosely from the roof. "If anybody had been in there they would have been very badly hurt or killed," Dr Crouch said.\n\nThe embassy, which was designed to withstand a bomb blast, suffered less damage than surrounding buildings but was still damaged by the huge explosion, which blew the gates down. Dr Crouch, who was at a meeting with the defence attache, General Ken Brownrigg, said: "The entrance was completely ... I was shocked, it was badly wrecked," Dr Crouch said.\n\n"We were told to run to the back of the building ... it was quiet and calm inside." An officer from the neighbouring Malaysian embassy, Nor Azizi, who rushed to the Australian mission after the blast blew in the windows in his building, said: "There were the bodies of a policeman and a security officer and civilians lying along the road. "I could not count the bodies because they were in pieces but I think there were more than five."\n\nBudi Harianto, 30, who was in a queue of visa applicants, said: "It was like an earthquake, like thunder." An employee of the Indosat phone company, Dedi Mulyardi, said he was in a building next to the Australian embassy when all the windows exploded.\n\n"We were in a meeting and everyone panicked and tried to get out. Everyone was screaming and when I got out I saw the white smoke and people covered in blood," he said. Alex Hutabarat, a 21-year-old student, said he heard a big explosion only five minutes after leaving the embassy, where he had applied for a visa. "I heard people screaming \'Help! Help!"\' Mr Hutabarat said.\n\n"I saw a big smoke rising up from the embassy and many people lying on the ground ... At least 15 people, including three westerners, had been waiting in line in front of the embassy\'s gate to apply for visas." With an election scheduled for Monday week, President Megawati Soekarnoputri flew back from a royal wedding in Brunei and urged Indonesians no to panic."I ask people to remain calm, to be aware of threats," she said.\n\nMs Megawati inspected the site of the bombing with Australia\'s ambassador, David Ritchie, and expressed condolences for the victims. A spokesman for the embassy said Ms Megawati offered "every assistance" in fighting terrorism and Mr Ritchie had offered Australian assistance in helping to find out who carried out the attack.

The ability of local administrations to function in some places might have been wiped out. Work sometimes just cannot be undertaken or completed.\n\n"The second is that donor countries can set conditions. For example, they say that a project has to be carried out by their own consultants or companies and within a set time.\n\n"Or they might decide that a project is not actually doing much good and abandon it. One could call this donor fatigue. If the conditions are not met, the aid is not given.\n\n"The third is that the attention of the governments is distracted by other disasters and events and money gets shuffled around to meet those needs."\n\nRushed projects\n\nThe discrepancy is evident in many major disasters. After Hurricane Mitch in Central America in 1998, a donor\'s conference in Stockholm the following year promised $9bn in aid.\n\nMAIN AID PLEDGES EU: $30m already being spent on the ground, $132m in short-term aid, $455m for long-term reconstruction Australia: $764m, distributed over five years, half the sum in loans Germany: $674m in aid over the next three to five years Japan: $500m - half in bilateral aid, half through multilateral institutions US: $350m in debt relief, no time scale given UK: $96m in aid of which $13m spent so far, hundreds of millions more promised\n\nWho\'s giving what Quake relief effort Do warning systems work?\n\nA year ago, the ancient Iranian city of Bam was hit by an earthquake and $1bn promised.\n\nThe estimates as to how much has reached Bam range from as low as $17m to just $115m.\n\nHowever, a closer look at what happened in these two events shows the complexities of reconstruction.\n\nA World Bank report on Honduras, for example, blamed both conditions set by donors - time limits among them - and the over-ambitious aims of reconstruction.\n\n"The objective was probably unrealistically ambitious for a country in crisis," it concluded.\n\nUp to half the money pledged after Hurricane Mitch was not spent\n\nThat meant in practice that Honduras was simply not able to spend all the money on offer.\n\nThe report said: "The quality of reconstruction work has been varied, often seriously inadequate."\n\nIt speaks of rushed projects and a lack of consultation with local people, and criticises organisations for sending people who could not speak Spanish.\n\nCo-ordination issues\n\nIn the case of Bam, another factor has come into play. This is the plan drawn up by the Iranian government to rebuild this historic city.\n\nThere has been leap-frogging, even an excess of offers. I am concerned at how all this money will be spent once the media circus has moved on\n\nHugh Goyder\n\nindependent consultant\n\nSuch a plan cannot be implemented within a year. So the level of aid actually taken up appears to be limited to temporary measures. That is why people are still living in shelters not houses.\n\nAnother factor is referred to in a World Bank report - the preference of the Iranian government to seek its own sources of finance.\n\nThat said, however, the World Bank approved a $220m reconstruction loan for Bam last September. So eventually more money should be available. But the delay will probably mean that some of the original pledges will lapse.\n\nBy general agreement it seems that the problem of failing to deliver on pledges applies much less to non-governmental organisations.\n\nThis is partly due to the smaller sums involved. But, in the case of British charities, they are bound by rules stipulating that a percentage of the aid - usually 80% - has to be spent within six months and the rest spread out.\n\nSome argue for a more flexible system but at least the charities know what they have to do.\n\nRealistic expectations?\n\nGovernments, in the view of some charities, are too free with their promises. John Davison of Christian Aid said bluntly: "Pledges are cheap."\n\nHugh Goyder, an independent development consultant in Oxford, implies that it is too easy to pledge.\n\nThe Bam quake in 2003 killed 20,000 and destroyed ancient sites\n\n"Driven by the media coverage of the tsunami and the humanitarian response this evokes, every leader offers a bigger and bigger figure.\n\n"There has been leap-frogging, even an excess of offers. I am concerned at how all this money will be spent once the media circus has moved on.\n\n"The problems of co-ordination are huge. There is the risk of multiple funding of the same project.

The high-tech equipment could detect tsunamis that are still many kilometres out at sea.\n\nIf disaster strikes twice, it could buy time - enough time, perhaps, to save hundreds of thousands of lives.\n\nBut unless you can warn people in remote areas, the technology is useless.\n\n"There\'s no point in spending all the money on a fancy monitoring and a fancy analysis system unless we can make sure the infrastructure for the broadcast system is there," said Phil McFadden, chief scientist at Geoscience Australia, which has been tasked with designing an Indian Ocean system by the Australian government.\n\n"That\'s going to require a lot of work. If it\'s a tsunami, you\'ve got to get it down to the last Joe on the beach. This is the stuff that is really very hard."\n\nEmergency response\n\nThe Pacific basin already has a warning system and, when there was a rash of tsunamis in the 60s, it proved invaluable.\n\nThe solution need not be high-tech\n\nProfessor Bill McGuire\n\nThe Pacific system, which cost tens of millions of dollars to install, works in quite a simple way. A pressure sensor sits on the bottom of the ocean and measures the weight of water above it.\n\nIf a tsunami passes overhead the pressure increases and the sensor sends a signal to a buoy sitting on the sea surface.\n\nThe buoy then sends a signal to a satellite, which in turn alerts a manned early warning centre.\n\nBut, as Dr Whitmore put it: "The warning system is more than just a warning centre. You have to have communication from the centre and then you need some sort of emergency response infrastructure.\n\n"And that is really the hardest part, getting a localised emergency response."\n\nAn operator sitting in an early warning centre in Jakarta might know about an impending tsunami, but how does he warn the fisherman in Sumatra, the sweet seller in Sri Lanka, the tribesman on Nicobar island?\n\nIn many of these places TV, radio, even a telephone, is not an option.\n\nTherefore, many experts say the biggest challenge is to establish an effective infrastructure, which can reach everybody - no matter how remote.\n\n"The population must be educated about tsunamis and how to respond when it comes," said Professor Bill McGuire, director of the Benfield Hazard Research Centre at University College London.\n\n"It is also critical that the final chain in the communication cascade - from emergency managers to population - is efficient and effective."\n\nCommunication failure\n\nTragically, it seems it was the final chain in the communication cascade that failed on Boxing Day. The truth is people did know about the earthquake, they did know about the tsunami threat, they just didn\'t know how to tell people.\n\nThe warning system could save lives, say some experts\n\nPowerful computers in a Vienna office building also picked up the seismic activity. Computers at the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) Organisation are designed to monitor nuclear explosions anywhere in the world but, as a side-effect, they also detect earthquake vibrations.\n\nAlthough the organisation\'s staff were on holiday, the information was automatically sent to several countries including Indonesia and Thailand but, again, the emergency infrastructure was missing.\n\nNearly everyone agrees an early warning system is needed in the Indian Ocean. Indeed, existing technology - like that used at the CTBT organisation - could play a vital role.\n\nBut the hard part will be developing a way of informing every swimmer and every fisherman.\n\nProfessor McGuire says that although the response infrastructure does need to be organised, it doesn\'t need to be complex.\n\n"I think sirens could play an important role," he told BBC News website.

Ms. Rice was one of two high-profile witnesses appearing before the commission on Thursday, but the only one to testify in public. Former President Bill Clinton was interviewed in private after Ms. Rice's testimony and told the panel that since the attacks he had asked himself repeatedly what his administration could have done to prevent them, members of the commission said afterward. [Page A14.]\n\nIn a statement released after the three-hour session, the commission described Mr. Clinton as ''forthcoming and responsive'' and thanked him for ''the excellent cooperation that he and his associates have given to us.''\n\nMs. Rice offered a spirited, unapologetic defense of the Bush administration's efforts against terrorism before Sept. 11, insisting that Mr. Bush had been aware of threats from Osama bin Laden's terrorist network throughout 2001 and had done all he could to prevent attacks.\n\n''President Bush understood the threat, and he understood its importance,'' said Ms. Rice, rebutting accusations made by her former counterterrorism chief, Richard A. Clarke, who has said the Bush administration largely ignored the threat of terrorist attacks before Sept. 11.\n\nIn the months before Sept. 11, she said, ''we moved to develop a new and comprehensive strategy to eliminate the Al Qaeda terrorist network.'' Despite the Aug. 6 intelligence report, she said, ''all of the threat reporting that was actionable was about threats abroad, not about the United States.''\n\nMembers of the commission, who have been allowed to read the August 2001 report but have not been allowed until today to discuss most of its contents, joined unanimously on Thursday in calling for the entire document to be declassified and made available to the public.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn response, the White House said it was hurriedly trying to declassify the report, and White House aides said it could be made public as early as Friday, an extraordinary reversal by the White House given its insistence a year ago that the contents of the President's Daily Brief were so highly classified that they could not be released even to the commission.\n\nThe White House appeared eager to release the entire Aug. 6 report to stem possibly damaging speculation about its contents, especially among Congressional Democrats who seized on Ms. Rice's testimony on Thursday in suggesting that Mr. Bush had paid too little attention to terrorism before Sept. 11.\n\n''President Bush received the now-famous P.D.B. on Aug. 6, while he was on vacation in Texas, yet he did not return to Washington until Aug. 30,'' said Senator John D. Rockefeller III of West Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, using the initials for President's Daily Brief.\n\n''At a time when our intelligence experts were warning of a possible strike against the United States, it's clear that the administration didn't take the threat seriously enough to marshal the resources that might have possibly thwarted the attack,'' he said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She said the report was only a page and a half long and that, while it contained a reference to possible Qaeda hijackings, ''it was not a warning -- there was no specific time, place or method involved.''\n\nShe made no mention at the time of other information in the document, including its reference to the F.B.I.'s numerous investigations of possible Qaeda sleeper cells in the United States and its blunt warning to Mr. Bush that Mr. bin Laden was determined to strike within American borders.\n\nThe importance of the document has grown in recent weeks as the investigation by the independent commission has shown that the government was inundated that summer with dire warnings from the C.I.A. and other agencies of imminent, possibly catastrophic terrorist attacks against the United States.\n\nIn some of the sharpest exchanges of the hearing, Richard Ben-Veniste, a former Watergate prosecutor and one of the Democrats on the commission, prodded Ms. Rice to justify her past descriptions of the Aug. 6 report.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n''You indicated here that this was some historical document, and I'm asking you whether it is not the case that you learned in the P.D.B. memo of Aug. 6 that the F.B.I. was saying it had information that preparations -- not historically, but ongoing preparations -- were being made consistent with hijackings within the United States,'' he said.\n\nMs. Rice said that much of the report was ''speculative'' and referred to intelligence gathered years earlier. ''This was not a warning,'' she repeated. ''This was a historical memo prepared by the agency because the president was asking questions about what we knew'' about domestic terrorism threats.\n\nMr. Ben-Veniste asked if there was anything in the document that should have given a reader any reassurance that a terrorist attack might be prevented. ''Certainly not,'' Ms. Rice replied. ''There was nothing reassuring. But I can also tell you that there was nothing in this memo that suggested that an attack was coming on New York or Washington, D.C. There was nothing in this memo as to time, place, how or where. This was not a threat report to the president.''\n\nMs. Rice's testimony offered a more charitable portrait of Mr. Clarke, her former deputy, who had been the target of a furious White House effort to undermine his credibility. Previously, she had described as ''scurrilous'' his accusation that Mr. Bush had been inattentive to terrorism threats before Sept. 11. Instead, she depicted Mr. Clarke as a valued deputy who had been retained from the Clinton administration because of his expertise in terrorism -- and who had easy access to her.\n\n''Dick Clarke is a very, very fine counterterrorism expert, and that's why I kept him on,'' she said. ''What I wanted Dick Clarke to do was to manage the crises for us and help us develop a new strategy.''\n\nAt the same time, however, she suggested that if terrorist threats were not brought to the president's attention, it was Mr. Clarke's fault.

Of the 39 Australians the Government is concerned about, 34 are in Thailand, two in Indonesia, two in Sri Lanka and one in the Maldives. Mr Downer had said earlier that Australia was "seriously concerned" about 41 Australians, but this was revised down.\n\n"These figures will change," Mr Downer said. "The fact that we have 10 dead and 41 we\'re seriously concerned about suggests that the number of Australians killed is going to be quite substantial. We are pessimistic about the figures, in the sense that we think that they could grow further."\n\nAnother 1250 were still unaccounted for in areas affected by the earthquake that hit the Indian Ocean on Boxing Day, with more than 850 of these believed to be in Thailand. Mr Keelty said: "The figure will be somewhere in between [the number for those still unaccounted for and those the Government has grave concerns for], but you\'ve got to expect that in a disaster of this size, where we\'re talking tens of thousands of people, that the percentage of Australians who will not have survived this will be much greater than the figures we are looking at." As the international death toll hit 125,000 - 80,000 in Indonesia alone - reports from Burma said that it, too, had been affected.\n\nMr Downer said he believed between 30 and 40 people had been killed there. Mr Keelty said an important part of the process of reconciling the figures of the missing with actual deaths was comparing state police missing persons lists with the calls to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade hotline. This was now taking place, Mr Keelty said.\n\nThe commissioner also said relatives of the missing should prepare themselves for the reality that some of the bodies of the deceased Australians would not be repatriated to Australia "for many months to come". "We know from the Bali experience it took three to four months for bodies to be repatriated - in this situation the scale of it, the spread of it, is much larger, and I think the processes will be very difficult to implement and people can expect a much longer delay for bodies to be repatriated," Mr Keelty said. According to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, there are 28 Australians in hospital - 23 in Thailand, four in Sri Lanka and one in the Maldives.\n\nAuthorities have confirmed that the body of 16-year-old Paul Giardina was returned to Melbourne yesterday. The bodies of seven Australians killed when the tsunami hit Thailand had already been returned home, the new Australian ambassador to the country, Bill Paterson, said yesterday.\n\n"We have got, I think, seven Australian bodies out," he told reporters in devastated Phuket.

Because most of the islands are too small to receive aeroplanes, heavy construction material will have to be transported by boat.\n\nCancelled holidays\n\nAnd the tsunami has wreaked havoc with fishing and tourism, the mainstays of a very small economy.\n\nMany fishing boats have been smashed to pieces.\n\nAnd while most tourist resorts are still open, 19 have had to close for repairs.\n\nThe government says these repairs will cost about $100m, but a sharp downturn in bookings is likely to put the total losses in the tourism sector at over $300m.\n\nOnly three tourists - all British - were killed - but the news of the tsunami made many people so frightened that they simply cancelled their holidays.\n\nOn one island resort close to the capital Male, we saw how the tsunami had torn through expensive holiday bungalows, which will now have to be completely rebuilt.\n\nAn anxious manager told us that in a normal year, he would expect to be fully booked in January.\n\n"But I only have 22 rooms occupied.

"If we go by past history, yes, I do have concern," Annan said. "We\'ve got over US$2 billion but it is quite likely that at the end of the day we will not receive all of it." Annan cited shortfalls in aid promised after the Bam, Iran earthquake in December 2003, where money fell short of pledges. "I think we stand a better chance of getting a substantial portion of the pledges and contributions that have been made, but I will not be surprised if we do not get all the money. That is the history we live with," Annan said. At the same time, officials called on the world to remember other people in need. "The rich world should be able to foot the bill for feeding all the children in the world," he said. "It\'s one day\'s worth of military spending," Egeland said. "We will follow up and we will hold those pledging to their pledges." Egeland said, while applauding the international response so far as "truly overwhelming."

Now more than 70 percent complete, the museum, scheduled to open in the fall of 2005, may appear massively imposing from the back side on John F. Kennedy Drive. But a first look inside reveals it to be a beautifully transparent building that reflects and merges with its natural surroundings.\n\nAmong other pleasing elements, it features two big interior gardens, seen through glass and open to the sky, that nearly bisect the three-level structure and bring the outside in.\n\nThe park\'s towering eucalyptus, pine and cypress trees can be seen from tall windows throughout the museum. Using a subtle geometry of parallelograms and triangles, the noted Swiss architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron have created lively public spaces that flow into each other along diagonal lines. A long, chevron-shaped stairway leads from the first floor to the lower, below- grade level, stretching along a 200-foot-long terraced garden to be planted with ferns. Eucalyptus will be planted in the other interior garden. Visitors will pass through the gardens on glassed-in bridges.\n\n"The park cuts deep into the building," said Herzog, on the phone from Basel. "We really wanted to improve the relationship between the visitors, the art and the park. We wanted them to be intertwined. The building is like a body, an organism where nature and people are almost blurring."\n\nComposed of 7,200 panels, textured in ever-varying patterns based on digital photographs of the park\'s tree canopy, the facade is always changing: As the copper oxidizes, it offers up unexpected shades of reddish brown, gold, blue and eventually green. The colors appear to change as light and shadows shift. The new de Young is believed to be the largest copper-clad building in the world.\n\nThe architects were inspired in part by the weather-worn copper and wood windmill out near Ocean Beach, which they came across while jogging through the park to get a feeling for the place. Herzog likens the de Young\'s copper facade, with its concave and convex patterns, to a sort of seismograph, "which can indicate the change of season, of daylight, like the surface of water," he said.\n\nAt 300,000 square feet, the new building is about 25 percent bigger than the old one but takes up an acre-and-a-half less land because it goes below grade. The lower level has 12,500 square feet of exhibition space for temporary shows, compared to about 9,000 feet in the old building.\n\n"This is a godsend," said Harry Parker, director of the city-owned Fine Arts Museums, noting that for years the de Young was the primary West Coast venue for blockbuster international traveling exhibitions like the King Tut and Van Gogh shows. But after the \'89 quake, the structure was deemed unsafe and lost its federal indemnification, which resulted in the loss of some big shows.\n\n"This will allow us to regain that position," said Parker, who has spent years working tirelessly to get this museum built -- over the objections of those who either didn\'t want the museum in the park at all or wished it looked more rustic, like a Bernard Maybeck building. At one point, the trustees voted to move the museum downtown, where it could draw bigger crowds. But public outcry persuaded them to reverse their decision and keep the de Young in the park, where it had its beginnings at the 1894 Midwinter Exposition.\n\nSan Francisco voters twice rejected bond measures to rebuild the city- owned de Young. Instead, the museum is being financed privately. So far, about $167 million has been raised.\n\nAnd along the way, the copper panels have provided a few surprises.\n\nNobody knows exactly what copper will do, but it usually doesn\'t turn black right away. That\'s why museum officials got a little panicky several months ago, after heavy winter rains, when they saw black streaks and splotches on some of the panels sheathing the new $200 million museum.\n\nExperts were summoned. A metallurgist from the German plant that milled the copper flew to San Francisco. So did Bill Zahner, owner of the Kansas City firm that manufactured the panels.\n\n"We had a big confab and agreed it would be best to do nothing," said Parker, standing in the museum\'s pentagon-shaped courtyard. The metal pros, who attributed the black splotches to aggressive oxidation, assured him and project director Deborah Frieden that the copper was fine and would change color naturally if left alone.\n\nThey were right, Parker said. "After a couple of months, it\'s gotten less blotchy, and the colors are much more interesting. Look at the blues," he added, marveling at the way the shifting light played off the seductive copper skin.\n\nThe last hurdle is the 800-car underground parking garage designed to serve the de Young and the planned new California Academy of Science across the concourse. A group called Trees Not Cars filed a lawsuit trying to stop the $50 million garage, which is being financed mostly with private money but will be city-owned. The plaintiffs argue that plans to raise some of the funds by selling bonds -- which would be repaid with parking fees -- violate the terms of the 1998 voter initiative approving the garage. Superior Court Judge James Warren is expected to rule on the case any day now.\n\n"Staying in the park was the right thing," said Parker, quickly adding, "with parking." He shudders at the thought of losing the garage, which was crucial to the planning of the new museum and its ability to attract visitors, particularly on Sundays, when the park is closed to traffic.\n\nThe building is designed so that patrons can enter the lower level directly from the underground garage. The two-story, 4,500-foot museum store, and the 300-seat auditorium can be entered from either the lower or first floors.\n\nThe main entrance is a 30-foot-wide opening, looking out onto the concourse, that leads through a copper-ceilinged passageway into the central courtyard. The dramatic indoor court, a soaring space that will be paved with pinkish-brown Italian limestone, flows into a series of galleries displaying the museum\'s holdings of Ancient & Native American, Australian and 20th century art. The cafe, on the west side, will open onto a large stone terrace and sculpture garden.\n\nThe second floor, which affords wide views of the park, contains galleries dedicated to the art of New Guinea, Africa, Indonesia and the Philippines, as well as the museum\'s noted collection of American art.\n\n"We wanted to give top-notch space to these non-Western arts," says Parker, walking through African gallery, whose floor and bowed ceiling will be finished in dark Australian eucalyptus.\n\nWhile the public spaces are designed for movement and activity, the galleries are calm and quiet. The rhythm of the American galleries suggests the enfilade, or series of rooms, of Beaux Arts architecture.\n\n"There are some very traditional classical elements, as well as a lot of modern ones," Parker said. "The old de Young was essentially little box rooms connected by corridors. Here you get a lot of different size spaces, and a lot of different kinds of light. It\'s much more active and much more spacious."\n\nThen there\'s the twisting 144-foot tall tower, a contemporary nod to the signature tower of the old de Young, which will contain classrooms. Nine stories high, if affords sweeping views of the park and the city, particularly from the top floor, where the panorama encompasses the Pacific, the cityscape and the towers of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\n"A museum doesn\'t need a tower, but it\'s pretty cool," Parker said with a laugh. "I think it\'s going to be one more lure to get people into the museum. "\n\nIt\'s been a long fight, Parker said, but worth it. "San Francisco is a tough place. People here are smart, and smart people are critical and have opinions. I don\'t begrudge them their opinions, but you\'d also like to have them concede the energy of the effort and the excellence of the aspirations.\n\n"This wasn\'t done as an act of expansion, or to house some great gift. It was done because the damn building was going to fall down and we had to replace it. I hope that after all this controversy, when it\'s all finished, people are going to say, "Oh, it fits so well with the park."\'', 'title': 'De Young Museum a copper-sheathed work of art / New building exploits park setting', 'url': 'https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/De-Young-Museum-a-copper-sheathed-work-of-art-2750720.php', 'keywords': ['old', 'garage', 'setting', 'exploits', 'art', 'park', 'work', 'coppersheathed', 'parker', 'museums', 'young', 'copper', 'museum', 'building'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': "De Young Museum a copper-sheathed work of art / New building exploits park settingA worker walks on top of the museum building.\nDe Young Museum Director Harry Parker shows us around the museum's partially built new building in Golden Gate Park.\nless A worker walks on top of the museum building.\nDe Young Museum Director Harry Parker shows us around the museum's partially built new building in Golden Gate Park.\nThe lower level has 12,500 square feet of exhibition space for temporary shows, compared to about 9,000 feet in the old building.", 'date': 1086778800}, {'text': '\n\nAction star Jet Li (L) and wife Nina are seen at the June 17, 2003 premiere of "The Hulk" in Los Angeles.

So instead of the gala, Mr. Lagos quickly downsized the event to a "working dinner" limited to a handful of senior staff members. Among White House aides and correspondents on the trip, no one could remember the last time a long-planned dinner had been canceled so precipitously.\n\nIt clearly lessened the glow of a trip that Chilean officials had hoped would highlight their status as Washington\'s best friend and closest ally in South America, and as a partner in a recently ratified free trade agreement.\n\n"Success of our free trade agreement is a model for other countries," said Mr. Bush, who came to office with an aggressive agenda for expanding trade with Latin America that had been largely derailed after the 2001 terror attacks. "Exports have risen dramatically in both our countries, and both the Chilean people and the people of the United States have benefited," he said. "And through the establishment of free trade in the Americas, we are committed to a future in which every free nation in the hemisphere can share in the benefits of open markets and in the creation of new jobs."\n\nDespite the economic closeness, Mr. Bush received what appeared to be a cool reception here. No crowds were on the streets to greet him as his motorcade sped through the city to the presidential palace late this afternoon, only small clutches of protesters.\n\nA Chilean reporter reminded Mr. Bush at the news conference that Mr. Lagos had opposed the Iraq war, and he then asked the president, "Who was right and who was wrong?" Mr. Bush launched into a defense of his action, but only after saying: "President Lagos didn\'t agree with my decision, and I respect that. He\'s still my friend."\n\nEarlier, Mr. Bush met with President Vicente Fox of Mexico, the foreign leader with whom he was closest when he came to office. Relations grew far more distant after Sept. 11, when action was delayed on Mr. Bush\'s plans for loosening immigration rules.\n\nCongress has balked at Mr. Bush\'s plan to change the law so that millions of illegal Mexican laborers could obtain temporary work visas in the United States but would not be able to use those visas as path to obtain citizenship. Mr. Fox is under pressure to persuade the president to expand the plan, and Mr. Bush said Sunday that he would use the political capital he gained in his re-election to get it passed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n"We\'d much rather have security guards chasing down terrorists or drug runners or drug smugglers than people coming to work," he said. "And so, therefore, I think a guest worker program is important, and I look forward to working with Congress on it."\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you\'re not a robot by clicking the box.

He was also asked about America\'s soaring budget deficits -- the kinds of questions his father used to receive in Japan in the late 1980\'s, before the deficits were turned to surpluses in the late 1990\'s.\n\n"The best way to affect those who watch the dollar\'s value is to make a commitment to deal with our short- term and long-term deficits," Mr. Bush said.\n\nThe Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit began in 1993 as a counterweight to the annual summit that brings the American president together with old allies -- Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Japan and Italy -- and most recently with Russia.\n\nAfter a dozen years, the meetings have allowed the American president to have at least one annual, face-to-face meeting with the leader of China -- something that previously required endless, difficult negotiations over which leader would visit the other. (Mr. Bush and Hu Jintao, the Chinese president, agreed Saturday that each would visit the other next year.)\n\nPerhaps more important, it brings together important regional heads of state who rarely have high-level interchanges with Washington, including the leaders of Vietnam and Indonesia. It is also a chance for small nations to showcase their progress -- as Chile did this year, and Brunei did in 2000.\n\nBut Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation has never become a serious decision-making body. It has only once been the stage for significant negotiations -- in the wake of the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990\'s. At that time, the assembled leaders agreed to steps to prevent future economic failures from rippling through the world financial system. Some of the provisions were adopted; others forgotten and never mentioned in follow-up meetings.\n\nOn Sunday, the leaders announced some modest goals in liberalizing trade but made no assessment of their progress toward a goal set in the 1990\'s: completely free trade among developed nations by 2010, and among the developing nations by 2020. An accord on controlling portable, shoulder-fired missiles, a huge threat to commercial aircraft, largely repeated goals the group set last year. An agreement on fighting corruption echoed an accord from several years ago.\n\nThe first sign of social misunderstanding between the United States and Chile came Saturday night, when Chilean security agents initially prevented Mr. Bush\'s lead agent from following him into a dinner for heads of state attending the conference. When Mr. Bush noticed the commotion, he walked back outside, reached into a group of scuffling guards, grabbed his lead agent by the suit and pulled him out of the melee. Mr. Bush then shook his head, as if in disbelief, and escorted the agent into the dinner.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a videotape of the incident, which played over and over throughout the region on Sunday, it appears as if Chilean security officials tried to restrain Mr. Bush before they recognized him -- perhaps thinking he was another member of the Secret Service detail. One of Mr. Bush\'s aides said that the president had been alerted before the incident that there was some disagreement with the Chileans about whether the detail would be allowed to enter the dinner.\n\nSecurity for the 21-nation conference is being provided by the Chilean national police, who have been widely criticized by human rights groups here and abroad for heavy-handed tactics, during the military dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet and under democratic rule. On Friday, the police used water cannons and tear gas to break up an anti-Bush street demonstration after a relatively small group of protesters threw rocks and bottles at them.\n\nAt the news conference here on Sunday afternoon, Mr. Lagos indirectly acknowledged the dispute, saying his government likes to receive foreign visitors "with the full honors they deserve," but minimized its importance. "We are going to have a work meeting, a news conference and then a working meal with President Bush, which is all that I would like to say about that in particular," he said.\n\nThe most important thing, the Chilean leader said, is not the social arrangements but to "gain the maximum advantage from a visit." When he last visited the United States in July, Mr. Lagos added, he followed the same format, that of a small working meal rather than an elaborate banquet.', 'title': "Security Dispute Dulls Luster of Bush's Trip to Chile", 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/22/world/americas/security-dispute-dulls-luster-of-bushs-trip-to-chile.html', 'keywords': ['free', 'mr', 'dulls', 'working', 'bush', 'luster', 'trade', 'united', 'lagos', 'bushs', 'president', 'chilean', 'trip', 'security', 'conference', 'chile', 'dispute'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'So instead of the gala, Mr. Lagos quickly downsized the event to a "working dinner" limited to a handful of senior staff members.\nDespite the economic closeness, Mr. Bush received what appeared to be a cool reception here.\nMr. Bush launched into a defense of his action, but only after saying: "President Lagos didn\'t agree with my decision, and I respect that.\nEarlier, Mr. Bush met with President Vicente Fox of Mexico, the foreign leader with whom he was closest when he came to office.\nMr. Bush then shook his head, as if in disbelief, and escorted the agent into the dinner.', 'date': 1101081600}, {'text': 'Turin unveils winter Olympics mascots\n\n(Agencies)\n\nUpdated: 2004-09-29 10:09\n\nCartoon characters named Neve and Gliz, representing a ball of snow and a block of ice, are the mascots for the 2006 Turin Olympics.\n\n\n\nThis drawing of the 2006 Turin winter olympic mascots Neve and Gliz was made available by TOROC (Torino Organizing Committee) during their presentation in Rome, Tuesday, Sept. 28, 2004.
