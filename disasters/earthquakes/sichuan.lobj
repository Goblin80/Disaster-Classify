Both parents and activists claim the official death toll of 5,335 is far lower than the estimate of 9000 dead compiled by local media soon after the earthquake, and have criticised the time it took the authorities to release the figure.\n\nWith the government keen to present their response to the earthquake as an example of the nation coming together under the positive leadership of the Communist Party, the earthquake region has been under a clampdown ahead of the one-year anniversary.

Many of the younger pupils were having a nap before resuming lessons.\n\nThe number of children who perished has never been released officially, but some estimates put it at around 10,000 – out of a death toll of 80,000. More than 8,000 families lost their only child in the disaster, with angry parents blaming shoddy building – or "tofu construction" – for their loss.\n\nDespite an initial openness in allowing foreign media to witness the aftermath of the quake, when public anger in China rose over badly built schoolhouses, the shutdown was swift and accusations of corruption were met with a stony silence.\n\nThe Amnesty report, entitled "Justice Denied: Harassment of Sichuan earthquake survivors and activists", outlines how officials in the province detained parents and relatives for up to three weeks for simply trying to get anwers about how their children died. Some were held repeatedly and the youngest detainee was only eight years old. "By unlawfully locking up parents of children who died, the government is creating more misery for people who have said in some cases they lost everything in the Sichuan earthquake," said Roseann Rife, Amnesty\'s Asia-Pacific Deputy Programme Director. "The Chinese government must stop harassing survivors who are trying to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives."\n\nAt one of the worst-affected schools, Juyuan Middle School in Dujiangyan, the classroom building collapsed, but nearby apartments and offices remained standing. Hundreds of schoolchildren died. Within weeks, it was ringed with a high security fence and patrolled by public security officers, who were quick to stop any efforts to film or report near the area. Locals were unwilling to talk, fearful of retribution.\n\nParents bringing signed petitions to local court offices were often harassed and jailed. Some outsiders who accompanied the victims\' families were ejected from the court buildings, before police raided their vehicles and confiscated equipment that might contain evidence.\n\nThe Amnesty report details how parents have been placed under surveillance to stop them from pursuing their cases and some activists who offered assistance to families are facing politically motivated trials on charges of endangering state security, a charge normally levelled at dissidents. One such activist is Huang Qi, who was held incommunicado for 100 days before being allowed to meet a lawyer. Detained since September last year, his trial has been postponed and he remains locked up without access to his family.\n\nThe report also draws attention to a directive issued by the provincial court in Sichuan, which bans all lower courts from accepting cases deemed sensitive. The government introduced measures to try to contain any dissent arising from the aftermath of the earthquake. Now, as China\'s economy slows, the government is even more keen to keep a lid on any contentious issues which it feels might lead to social unrest. Beijing has also accused foreign governments and human rights groups of meddling in its internal affairs.\n\nParents were given a lump sum and 100 yuan each (£11) per month in supplementary benefits and sent messages of support to reduce the political fallout over shabby building standards and poor supervision of school construction.\n\nThe family planning commission in Chengdu City set up a special programme to support those parents whose only child was killed or badly injured in the quake.\n\nBut many of the parents are looking for something more.\n\n"I want to seek justice for the dead students," said a father quoted in the Amnesty report. He lost a 15-year-old at Beichuan Middle School. "Corruption is rampant in China," he added. "The children were still so innocent and suddenly they passed away.\n\n"Some of their bodies are still buried under the rubble and we will never find them. That\'s why it is so heartbreaking for many parents.\n\n"Except the school building, other buildings in Beichuan county did not collapse during the earthquake. What kind of earthquake was this?"\n\nMy fight for justice: One father\'s tale\n\nThe middle-aged father cannot be identified because he is worried about the consequences, worried about penalties worse than arrest.\n\nHis daughter died at Juyuan Middle School in Dujiangyan, when the earthquake hit Sichuan last May.\n\nShe was 18 but was still at the Middle School, in a class with mostly younger students. She had had to delay her studies at various intervals because her parents were poor and needed her to stay and work the land.\n\n"The government has said that we can have a second child, and a lot of people in the village are pregnant, but many are having miscarriages," her grieving father said.\n\n"I would say about 60 per cent are having miscarriages. My wife had a miscarriage after three months, some people are losing the baby after five months. Our children were teenagers, we are too old to become parents again."\n\nLast week he came to Beijing to deliver a petition to the office of the State Council, or China\'s cabinet. He said he had already received several threatening phone calls. The callers don\'t say who they are, but their message is clear: leave well alone if you know what\'s good for you.\n\nBut the Sichuan father said he was ready to be picked up by police if that was what it took to get justice for his dead daughter.\n\n"I received 80,000 yuan (£8,500) in compensation. But I want a thorough investigation," he said. "I don\'t care if they arrest me. Let them arrest me. I\'ve lost my child, I don\'t care what they do.\n\n"The central government has good policies, but they don\'t work because of the local government. The local government takes our land without permission and they do all kinds of bad things. So how can we expect them to look after us after something like this?" he said.\n\n"We are taking our message to the State Council, because they will understand.

Ai Weiwei, an artist who is one of China’s best-known gadflies, said the figures were incomplete and “meaningless” because they lacked specifics, like names, ages and places of death. Mr. Ai, who is compiling his own detailed list of the dead, estimates the final figure at around 6,000. He said more precise information from the government might shed some light on the issue of substandard school construction or at least show that the government was truly willing to tackle that fundamental concern.\n\n“The government is trying to escape from the accountability on this matter by postponing or rejecting the publication of details,” he said.\n\nGovernment officials say that 68,712 people died during the earthquake. Another 17,921 are listed as missing but are presumed to be dead. According to the official media, 7,000 classrooms and dormitory rooms collapsed during the quake.\n\nOver the past year, a number of other people who sought to draw attention to the questions over school construction have been punished or are awaiting trial, including Liu Shakun, a teacher who was charged with “disseminating rumors and disrupting social order” after he posted photographs of destroyed schools on the Internet.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

These are all signs of stress," said Wang Pengyan, Wolong\'s chief engineer.\n\n\n\nJust 13 panda cubs were born in the past year, down from 17 in 2007 and a record of 30 in 2006.\n\n\n\n"Our staff have taken many measures. We spent a lot of time to communicate and play with them. In this way, they recovered slowly. We talked to them in kind voices, usually praising them how good and nice they are," Wang said. "The quake could be one of the reasons why there were less newborn pandas this year. This is only our assumption so far."\n\nMost of the animals survived the quake at the reserve, located just eight kilometers from the quake epicenter, though one - a female named Mao Mao - was found dead, two were injured and one is still missing today.\n\n\n\n"Our panda homes have been damaged by the earthquake, so we had to keep our pandas in limited space. This creates a lot of pressure both on our staff and on the pandas," said Wang Pengyan, Wolong\'s director. "Limited living-space for the pandas has been the biggest challenge for the reserve so far."\n\nThe lush, mountainous region is the natural habitat of the giant pandas. Before the earthquake, China boasted of 128 pandas born in captivity, of which 63 were born in the Wolong reserve.\n\nIn recent months, Wolong\'s giant pandas have been transferred to the Ya\'an reserve -- which is 110 kilometers from the quake epicenter and has become known as the "quake survivor shelter" for pandas -- and to other cities in China for temporary shelter. In April, the last six pandas born in captivity in Wolong were moved into their new homes in Ya\'an.\n\nA new location has been selected for the Wolong Reserve in Wolong\'s Dida Village, about 10 kilometers away from the original location. The reconstruction, supported by the Hong Kong SAR government, will start in August this year. Their new homes are expected to be ready in two years time.

However, they are also suffering from the damages to their natural environment."\n\nFor years, these beloved creatures have become symbols of nature preservation.\n\n\n\nFor China, they have often played special roles as the Asian giant\'s cuddly diplomats -- in zoos at home and overseas and during international events such as the Beijing Summer Olympics.\n\nIn 2008, eight pandas from various nature reserves were flown to the Beijing Zoo for a six months\' special appearance before and during the Olympics.\n\n\n\nIn April of this year, six other pandas -- five of them quake survivors -- were sent from a panda base in Chengdu to the Beijing Zoo, waiting for the Chinese 60th National Day celebration in October.', 'title': 'Plight of the giant panda: Animals struggle after quake', 'url': 'http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/05/11/china.quake.pandas/index.html', 'keywords': ['wolong', 'struggle', 'wolongs', 'china', 'reserve', 'panda', 'quake', 'earthquake', 'plight', 'pandas', 'giant', 'animals', 'wang'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'A panda cub at the Giant Panda Breeding Centre in Chengdu last week.\nmore photos »The quake triggered mountain landslides and caused damage across large areas of the forests at the Wolong Giant Panda Protection Studies Center, also known as "the Home of Pandas."\nThe lush, mountainous region is the natural habitat of the giant pandas.\nBefore the earthquake, China boasted of 128 pandas born in captivity, of which 63 were born in the Wolong reserve.\n"We haven\'t found any giant panda in the wild who died from the earthquake," Wang said.', 'date': None}, {'text': "Over the past year, as they tried to expose instances of substandard school construction, bloggers, activists and parents whose children perished under mounds of rubble have been harassed or jailed.

Even dispatches from Xinhua, the state-run news agency, noted that collapsed schools were often surrounded by buildings that appeared unscathed.\n\nFour days after the earthquake, an online chat sponsored by People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s mouthpiece, featured officials who stated that “there were certainly quality issues behind the collapse of school buildings, and we will conduct a strict and uncompromising investigation.”\n\nBy late June, however, the reins had been fully pulled back. Reporters who did not work for Xinhua or other strictly controlled, state-run media outlets were forced to leave the quake zone. Publications that had questioned the quality of the school buildings were criticized, or in some cases compelled to punish the offending writers and editors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne reporter said that he and his colleagues had gathered compelling proof that cutting corners and inadequate oversight by local officials contributed to the high student death toll.

Home to more than 12,000 species of plants and 1,122 species of vertebrates, the area includes more than half of the habitat for the Earth\'s wild giant panda population, said study lead author Weihua Xu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.\n\n"We estimate that above 60 percent of the wild giant panda population was affected to some extent by the earthquake," said Xu in the report.\n\nIn an effort to develop conservation strategies for the panda\'s remaining habitat, Xu and his colleagues used satellite imagery to determine the pandas\' habitat loss and fragmentation in the South Minshan region, which is adjacent to the earthquake\'s epicenter.\n\nSince forests are the main vegetation type used by the pandas, the authors compared forested areas in satellite images from September 2007, before the earthquake, to images after the earthquake and its aftershocks, in July 2008.\n\nThe authors then combined results based on these satellite data with criteria that make forests suitable for pandas, including elevation, slope incline and presence of bamboo. Their analyses revealed that more than 354 square kilometers, or about 23 percent, of the pandas\' habitat was converted to bare land.\n\nOf the remaining habitat, the researchers found that large habitat areas had been fragmented into smaller, disconnected patches, which Xu says can be just as harmful as habitat destruction.\n\n"It is probable that habitat fragmentation has separated the giant panda population inhabiting this region, which could be as low as 35 individuals," said Xu.\n\n"This kind of isolation increases their risk of extinction in the wild, due in part to a higher likelihood of inbreeding."\n\nXu and his colleagues proposed a plan to encourage pandas to move between patches using specially protected corridors. They also recommend areas to be protected outside of nature reserves and that post-earthquake relocation of affected towns takes panda habitat into consideration.\n\n"It is vital to the survival of this species that measures are taken to protect panda habitat outside nature reserves," said Xu.\n\n"Giant pandas in this region are more vulnerable than ever to human disturbance, including post-earthquake reconstruction and tourism.

"This earthquake was very unusual for this area.\n\nThere have been no seismic activities greater than a magnitude seven quake along this particular seismic belt before."\n\nThe 7.9 magnitude quake struck last May and left more than five million people homeless. It remains a raw and emotional topic for most Chinese, and the government has been quick to quash any suggestion that Zipingpu may have been responsible for the catastrophe. Researchers have been denied access to seismological and geological data to examine the earthquake further.\n\nZipingpu is only one of nearly 400 hydroelectric dams in the earthquake zone. Mr Fan said the government had been warned of the danger of building so many large-scale projects in a seismically active area, but that the warnings had gone unheeded.\n\n"I not only opposed the construction of Zipingpu, but also the overdevelopment of the reservoirs on Minjiang River. There are ten major reservoirs on the main river, 29 on its tributaries and a lot more smaller-scale reservoirs, all of which block the flow of the entire river, and are very hazardous to the local geology," he said.\n\nAlthough Sichuan is an earthquake-prone region, many scientists were caught by surprise by the magnitude of the quake. Christian Klose, a scientist at Columbia University\'s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, said there had not been any "major seismic activity" on that fault line for millions of years.\n\nHe argued that the sudden shift of a huge quantity of water into the region could have simultaneously relaxed the tension between the two sides of the fault, allowing them to move apart, and also increased the direct pressure enough to cause a violent rupture. The effect was "25 times more" than a year\'s worth of natural stress from tectonic movement, he said.\n\nAlthough the official government line is that its massive construction projects had nothing to do with the quake, some state researchers in Beijing have called for a full investigation.

This is the heart of Sichuan, in the centre of China, a giant landlocked basin between the Himalayas to the west, the Qinling range in the north and the mountains of Yunnan to the south.\n\nLarger geographically and more populous than Germany, Sichuan is the country's rice bowl, growing more food than any other province, from pork, rice and wheat to peaches and sweet potatoes. But due to the sheer weight of humanity living in Sichuan, the province has always remained poor.\n\nThe region has not only been left behind by China's economic success, it has actually suffered as a result. Villages in the countryside have been drained of almost everyone of working age, leaving only the very old and the very young. Sichuanese workers can be found on almost every construction site in China.\n\nIt was the Qiang, an ethnic tribe of nomads, who first settled around the Minjiang river between the 11th and 16th centuries bc; neither wholly Chinese nor Tibetan, they were known both for their sumptuous embroidery and for their taste in smoking orchid leaves. Researchers believe that the Qiang may be China's oldest people, with a culture and religion that predates both Tibetan Buddhism and Taoism. They farmed the slopes and collected Chinese caterpillar fungus and fritillary butterflies to sell as traditional medicine. Further up in the mountains lived some of China's rarest species: giant pandas, golden monkeys and flying foxes.\n\nWith its mist-shrouded mountains and lush plains, the scenery around Beichuan is beautiful, the land naturally fertile, with a mild climate and soft showers. But today Beichuan looks like it has been smashed into matchsticks by a giant fist.\n\nAt 2.30pm on May 12 last year, the 155-mile Longmenshan Fault that runs diagonally through Sichuan buckled, then ripped in two, causing China's strongest earthquake for more than half a century, with a magnitude of 8.0 (the recent Italian quake measured 6.3).\n\nTremors were felt 1,000 miles away, leading to the evacuation of skyscrapers in Shanghai and Hong Kong. Buildings on the slopes of the valley above Beichuan slid and piled up on each other in a concertina before smashing against the homes below, though it is likely that these would have collapsed anyway.\n\nThe town, just over 60 miles from the epicentre of the quake, was completely destroyed. Only half of its 20,000 inhabitants survived. In the aftermath volunteers who rushed to Beichuan from all over China described the tangle of limbs wedged in the debris, the faint cries of the survivors and the corpses lying in the road, suffocated by the dust that caked their eyes and hair.\n\n'Everything was covered in blood. It was like hell,' Zhang Wei, who works for a disaster relief charity, says. 'I've seen disasters before, but nothing like this.'\n\nThe earthquake devastated a huge swath of Sichuan. Even now, as the anniversary of the disaster approaches, the death toll is still rising. The latest estimate is that 70,000 people lost their lives and a further 10 million, many of them poor and elderly (the cities of Sichuan were left relatively unscathed, while the villages bore the brunt), were made homeless.\n\nThe earthquake also tore a deep wound in the public consciousness. Although the region has a history of calamity, and has been hit hard by floods and landslides over the years, this was the first time that images of a major disaster were beamed directly into homes across the country, stirring up strong feelings in a population that is usually shielded from bad news.\n\nThe decision to allow journalists into Sichuan came after the government had blocked media access to riots in Tibet in March 2008, a decision that fuelled protests across the world at China's secrecy and brutality, as well as criticism that Beijing was not upholding the terms under which it had been granted the Olympics. Journalists who were used to hiding from the authorities suddenly found themselves invited on board military helicopters headed for the disaster zone. The result was an unprecedented well of public emotion and a colossal wave of donations.\n\nBeichuan has become a place of pilgrimage. Four to five thousand visitors arrive each day to pay their respects, or simply to see the scene of devastation for themselves. A long queue of tour buses disgorge visitors two miles from the town itself and they walk the rest of the way, often carrying small tokens for the dead: a steamed bun, a bag of oranges or a bottle of bai jiu, a fierce Chinese grain alcohol. Robed monks quietly pad along the road every day to pray for the victims.\n\nAlong the way, the town's survivors have set up stalls, selling their famous embroidery alongside cowboy hats and plastic swords, blocks of dried tofu and smoked meat. Several stalls sell laminated diagrams of the town's destruction and photographs of Wen Jiabao, the Chinese premier. 'Grandfather' Wen arrived in Sichuan the day after the earthquake struck, and broke down in tears. The public display of emotion was unprecedented for a Chinese leader, and Wen continues to enjoy enormous support to this day.\n\nThe road finally winds its way up into the mountains, and widens out into a prospect overlooking the ghost town. No one will ever live here again, the government has said, because of the risk of another disaster. Rumours have circulated through the town that Beichuan was marked for relocation decades ago, but that there was little money for the project. Now, however, a £230 million museum will be built on the site.\n\nRelatives of the dead sit quietly on rocks next to the road, their heads bowed. Others burn sticks of incense and pray on their knees. Small marble plaques dot the hillside, each one engraved with a remembrance.\n\nWang Zhiqui, 43, walks up the mountain each day to sell trinkets to the tourists. She makes only 400 to 500 yuan (£40-50) a month, but there are few other jobs going. 'My family survived the earthquake, but my sister's family and my uncle's family all died,' she says. 'And there was not just the earthquake, there was also a huge flood in the valley in July. Only last October did we start to piece ourselves together again.'\n\nLike the vast majority of families who lost their houses, Wang now lives in a temporary home not far from the scene of destruction, in a camp built hastily after the earthquake to house the homeless.\n\nBuilt in long rows, the prefabricated huts are identical: 40 sq ft grey boxes, their edges trimmed in blue, with a solitary window punched in the wall. The sides are made from two sheets of aluminium with a polystyrene core for insulation. Inside, there is a single lightbulb, but no heating at all, because of the fire risk. Baking hot in summer, the huts froze in the winter as condensation turned to ice.\n\nSome of the quake victims refused to move to the temporary camps so that they could stay close to their farms, their only source of income. The people who have made the move say they are happy to be safe. Many have brought what they could salvage to their new homes. Meals are cooked outside, in the corridors between huts, and often shared with neighbours.\n\nSmall businesses have sprung up in the camps. Zhang Yueqing, a 42-year-old woman with a hunchback and deformed legs, runs a shop in a camp near the town of Wudu, selling instant noodles, bottled water and sweets. Boxes of stock are piled up inside her hut next to her bed.\n\nMrs Zhang and her husband lost their 10-year-old daughter in the earthquake when her school collapsed and do not have permission to have another child because of her disability. Other victims who lost their child have been allowed to have a second child to look after them in their old age.\n\n'I only survived because I hid in our cellar,' she says. 'I crawled out, dragging myself from under the house. I am recovered emotionally, more or less. I may not have another child, but the government will provide for us.'\n\nIn another corridor lives Zhang Shuyong, a 38-year-old teacher from Yuan Bao, a village more than an hour's drive away, who takes care of two deaf boys, Yuan Chen, seven, and Li Fengshui, six. 'We were lucky,' she says. 'When the earthquake happened, we were in a hearing aid factory on the outskirts of our town, looking for new hearing aids for the boys. That's how we survived.' Her husband was helping to build a new railway line and also escaped unharmed. 'Our house in the mountains totally collapsed. A lot of villagers stayed up there, but everyone with young children moved here, to the camp.'\n\nThey aim to rebuild their house, but with aftershocks from the earthquake still rattling Sichuan every week, they are concerned about landslides. Outside the camp, a red banner has been stretched across the road: the people are invincible! we are heroes! we will not be wiped out!\n\nZhang's old village is almost impossible to reach because of an endless stream of identical red lorries trundling along the one-lane mountain road, carrying construction supplies and removing debris. The rebuilding of Sichuan has begun in earnest.\n\nIn the past few months entire villages have sprung up from the rubble. Fleets of lorries haul bricks and steel into the earthquake zone and carry rubble out, kicking up thick clouds of dust on the roads. Yuan Bao, Zhang's village, sits astride a ravine. On one bank, teams of men are unloading bricks into towering piles as male and female workers with shovels stand over the foundations of a new development. On a large billboard there is a computer-generated design for neat rows of apartment blocks and even a swimming-pool.\n\nBut on the other side of the village the scene is grim. A squat shanty town has been cobbled together from mismatched pieces of wood and corrugated steel roofs. In one hut, 66-year-old Chen Jingzhong sits making cut-out men from yellow and green paper. A basket of papier-mâché heads is at his feet and he carefully glues the men together at a low table. The paper army is designed to be burnt at funerals, to join the deceased in the next life. The work nets him 100 to 200 yuan each month (£10-20).\n\nAlthough there are many empty prefab huts in the valley below, Chen and his wife, Zhong Bangxiu, 61, were told to move out of their temporary homes and return to their village in January and given 1,700 yuan (£170) to fend for themselves.\n\nAlthough the Chinese government has publicly pledged £100 billion for the reconstruction of Sichuan, it has provided few details about how the money will be spent and over what period of time. The majority of the money is thought to have been earmarked for infrastructure projects, such as new roads, railways, schools and hospitals, but there are continuing doubts over when the money will arrive. The vast donations pledged by Chinese and foreign companies and individuals have also not been accounted for. Donors were told they had to give the money either to the government or to the Red Cross, and there has since been little information about where their money has gone.\n\n'After the earthquake, we came under a lot of pressure to give money,' one chief executive in Shanghai told me. 'If we hadn't given money, we would have been criticised by our partners and suppliers. We gave money towards rebuilding a school, but we've heard nothing more about it since, or whether the school has been built.'\n\nIn common with many other villages, the homes in Yuan Bao are being built by a private contractor which won a tender from the local government.\n\n'They wanted to get us to build our own houses but they didn't give us enough money,' Chen says. 'All we could afford was this shack, which we built ourselves, with our own hands and without any help from anyone.' Wooden poles had been hastily nailed together and then wrapped in plastic sacking to waterproof the structure. 'At least we could light a fire here, so we weren't too cold.'\n\nYuan Bao's 200 other villagers were also forcibly transferred out of the camps, and are now wondering if they will ever be able to afford the payments that the private contractors will charge for the properties on the other bank. Not all villagers will be allocated a new home anyway – there aren't going to be enough to house everyone in the village. 'None of us here can afford to build his own home,' Ma Chuanping, a neatly dressed 60-year-old woman, says. 'This town depended on the stone quarry for work and for the local council to have cash. But the quarry has been closed since the quake, so there's just no cash.'\n\nThe residents pass the time gambling on mahjong, or, in Chen's case, sipping neat bai jiu from a plastic two-litre bottle. 'It has been so long after the earthquake now that no one cares about us any more,' he growls. 'We don't know what will happen. We hope to move to one of the new homes, but we don't know how we will get the money.'\n\nThe Chinese government has set a target that everyone should have started building their own homes by the anniversary of the quake, but few have managed to find the resources. The price of bricks, cement and steel has inflated rapidly, and the average cost of a home is now about 80,000 yuan (£8,000). The government compensation to victims ranges between 16,000 and 23,000 yuan per family, and the process of winning compensation for their collapsed homes has been long and bureaucratic. Each home has had to be inspected by an official to check that it is uninhabitable.\n\nThe government plans to start shutting down the temporary camps this coming August, although many charities believe that victims will still be in the camps several years from now.\n\n'I reckon only 10 per cent have started rebuilding, a year after the quake,' one NGO worker in Chengdu tells me. 'Now that a year has passed, everyone's immediate needs have been taken care of. The problem is that people are now waking up to the idea that they are going to have to spend the next five years of their lives in a small metal hut or makeshift shack. A lot of people are still falling through the gaps here.'\n\nThe sheer size of Sichuan makes the overall picture all but impossible to judge, in the absence of any reliable statistics from the Chinese government. Francis Markus, who works for the International Red Cross in Sichuan, is optimistic about the rebuilding programme and says that almost a third of people have finished building their homes in the areas where the Red Cross operates. British donors gave £2.7 million in aid, and much of the money is being used for bridging loans to help people construct homes.\n\nYuejia village, near the city of Mianyang in the north of Sichuan, is one of the villages that has received Red Cross money and construction has nearly finished on a development of neat white-washed villas, each with its own courtyard and earthquake-proof foundations. The houses can withstand a magnitude eight quake, according to Markus. 'We are so used to the aftershocks we don't even notice anything less than a seven,' one villager jokes.\n\nThe old village was entirely destroyed by the earthquake, Cao Cheng, a 44-year-old wood carver, explains. 'When the quake hit, we had no idea what was happening. The wind suddenly started blowing hard and the telephone poles collapsed. Fountains of black mud exploded from the ground, and people started screaming.' Amazingly, no one in the village was killed.\n\n'Funnily enough, only one man was injured in the quake – he had gone to the hospital in the morning to see the doctor and the hospital fell down on top of him,' Cao says.\n\nOverlooking a valley filled with yellow rape, the villagers have left up the red lanterns they hung for Chinese New Year as a sign of celebration. 'There's a very definite sense of momentum. Everyone in Sichuan is very eager to make progress towards the government targets,' he says.\n\nAll donations from within China have been funnelled either through the government or the Red Cross. 'This was a hugely significant event for the Chinese Red Cross,' Markus says. 'The way that the Red Cross has been given a major role is a real sea change.'\n\nHe explained that the Chinese Red Cross, which had traditionally been a part of the Communist system, had only recently been spun out of the health ministry and given its independence. The earthquake was the first real test of whether an outside body could play a role in disaster relief without threatening the party apparatus. According to Markus, the Chinese Red Cross had risen to the challenge magnificently. Other charities claim that the organisation remains deeply tied to the Chinese government and is institutionally opaque about its actions.\n\nFurther down the road teams of workers in hard hats are laying heavy steel girders into the foundations for a new school, also funded by the Red Cross. The collapse of schools throughout Sichuan remains one of the most painful and upsetting aspects of the tragedy, and continues to provoke huge anger across China. Construction in China is often slapdash, with builders usually claiming to be able to throw up a two-storey school in less than two months, but in Sichuan there was a suspicion of deliberate negligence.\n\nIn towns where ancient buildings remained standing, schools simply toppled, killing thousands of children. Some parents said the schools looked like they had been built out of 'the dregs of tofu' and blamed officials for stealing the budget during construction. One father said he had scrabbled in the rubble searching for his daughter, and had seen that bamboo, rather than steel, was used to reinforce the concrete.\n\nThe Communist Party has still not officially confirmed the death toll among children or admitted that the construction of schools was at fault. In his rage, Ai Weiwei, the designer of the Bird's Nest Olympic stadium in Beijing, has started to publish an unofficial list of the dead children on his website. 'I'm really tired of this bullshit,' he said in a recent interview. 'I went there, and I saw school buildings collapsed, and next to them are buildings that are fine.' Perhaps surprisingly, Ai's dissent has so far gone unpunished.\n\nPrivately, officials are prepared to admit fault. 'Of course the schools were badly built,' one said. 'They were built in the 1980s, when China was poor and we didn't have enough money to go around.' But promises of an investigation have not been honoured.\n\n'No one has been here to look over the school,' Zhen Zhenxian, 53, a barber from the city of Dujiangyan tells me. Zhen's threadbare shop faces the site of the former Dujiangyan middle school, where up to 900 children are thought to have died. In the old playground, white butterflies flit over the rubble, which has been covered in a carpet of grass. A rusty basketball hoop stands in a large puddle.\n\nZhen plays me a video of the scene that he captured on his mobile phone three minutes after the earthquake struck. Frantic crowds of children, dressed in blue, white and red tracksuits, were running and screaming while others lay prone on the ground, knocked unconscious by falling bricks.\n\n'When the earthquake happened, I was in the shop,' he says. 'I heard something that sounded like huge rocks clashing together and I saw the road buckle. We ran outside, but there were tall buildings all around and the school building itself was swaying from side to side.\n\n'Then it suddenly collapsed; the whole thing became rubble in less than a minute. I have a niece who was on the third floor and she jumped out of a window to escape, and survived with just a few injuries. Only two classes survived, the ones doing PE in the playground and the computer class in a different building,' he says.\n\n'Everyone in the town started running towards the school, and parents were tearing at the rocks with their hands. Fifteen minutes later a policeman arrived on his motorbike, but he was hit by a piece of falling masonry and hurt his leg badly. So he couldn't ride back and call for help, and the phone lines were down.\n\n'When night fell, we put up our own camp, but we didn't have any water or food and we couldn't sleep because the children were just next to us, buried. On the first day we could hear lots of voices of those who were buried, but on the second day there were only two or three voices and then there were none,' he says, bowing his head.\n\nThe thousands of dead children across Sichuan have become one of China's biggest taboos. Many of their parents, who had clamoured loudly for an investigation, have now fallen silent. Several NGOs speculate that they have accepted compensation in cash, together with a clause that silences them. 'How much of the earthquake relief fund went on paying off the parents?' one charity worker asks.\n\nWith the anniversary of the earthquake imminent, the Communist Party is keen to show the world that every effort is being made to rebuild Sichuan. On the road to Beichuan, where Communist Party officials regularly visit in their limousines, several Qiang villages have been beautifully restored. Some resemble clusters of alpine chalets: the houses are clad in stone and boast timber roofs and intricately carved windows and doors.\n\nBut the authorities have also gone to great lengths to ensure that some areas are off-limits and out of sight, and in the run-up to the anniversary, the Sichuan provincial government has closed down access to the region for journalists. Since the beginning of April, reporters have had to apply for a separate permit for different towns within the earthquake zone, a lengthy bureaucratic procedure designed to control or stop foreign media travelling through the region.\n\nWenchuan, the epicentre of the earthquake, is completely off-limits, partly due to its proximity to Tibet. Police roadblocks have closed off all access routes to the area to anyone without important business. Teams of paramilitaries in camouflage gear search through cars and stop lorries. According to 5.12, an umbrella group that seeks to coordinate the NGOs working in the region, a large population of Tibetans was badly hit by the earthquake, but has received little help.\n\nIn Beichuan the main worry is now the economy, which was destroyed by the disaster, leaving large numbers jobless. Farmers believe it will take several years to rebuild their herds and their land, and while there are some short-term construction\n\njobs available, they are only for the young and physically able, and unlikely to create a sustainable economy.\n\n'We don't know when we will have a job again, or the money to leave our camp,' Wang Zhiqui says. 'This is what we have to focus on now,' Francis Markus at the Red Cross adds. 'The financial crisis has affected China and the economic situation here makes it very difficult for people to work their way back up the ladder.'\n\nIn what is left of Beichuan, soldiers work to clear a path through the rubble, to ensure that by the anniversary of the earthquake the world will see that the Chinese government is laying the ghosts of the disaster and bringing Sichuan back to life. But just below the surface, the fault lines remain.", 'title': 'Millions still homeless a year after Sichuan earthquake', 'url': 'https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/5243720/Millions-still-homeless-a-year-after-Sichuan-earthquake.html', 'keywords': ['yuan', 'chinese', 'town', 'sichuan', 'earthquake', 'millions', 'money', 'homeless', 'cross', 'red', 'school', 'village'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': "'Grandfather' Wen arrived in Sichuan the day after the earthquake struck, and broke down in tears.\nThey aim to rebuild their house, but with aftershocks from the earthquake still rattling Sichuan every week, they are concerned about landslides.\n'This was a hugely significant event for the Chinese Red Cross,' Markus says.\nAccording to Markus, the Chinese Red Cross had risen to the challenge magnificently.\n'This is what we have to focus on now,' Francis Markus at the Red Cross adds.", 'date': None}, {'text': "James C.

It mobilized quickly, but the troops were unprepared to save lives in the first 72 hours, when thousands were buried under toppled masonry and every minute mattered.\n\n“You basically had a bunch of guys humping through the mountains on foot and digging out people with their hands,” Mr. Mulvenon said. “It was not a stellar example of a modern military.”\n\nIn an online forum hosted by the state-run People’s Daily, Zhang Zhaozhong, a prominent defense analyst, said that specialized units like the Marine Corps, the 38th Army Corps of Engineers and the engineering division of the Second Artillery Corps understood how to rescue survivors from beneath collapsed buildings. But he acknowledged that the overwhelming majority of the deployed forces, ordinary combat troops, had little if any rescue training.\n\nThe army had about 100 helicopters ferrying food, supplies and medical teams into the remote mountain areas and rescuing the injured, said Dennis J. Blasko, a former American Army attaché in Beijing. “The management of aircraft and helicopters operating in the area is probably the largest extended operation of its kind the P.L.A. has ever conducted,” he said.\n\nBut Mr. Blasko and other experts said that because the military did not have heavy-lift helicopters, vital equipment like excavators and cranes had to be brought in on roads obstructed by landslides, slowing the pace of the rescue operations.\n\nShen Dingli, a leading security expert at Fudan University in Shanghai, said the military’s response did not reflect well on the military’s preparedness for a potential war with, say, Taiwan, the independently governed island that China claims as its sovereign territory. China’s air force deployed 6,500 paratroopers to Sichuan, but only 15 ended up dropping into the disaster zone, military officials said, because of bad weather and forbidding mountain terrain. Mr. Shen called the effort too little and too late.\n\n“The air force should have been able to get troops into Wenchuan in two hours,” he said, referring to a county near the quake’s epicenter. “It took 44 hours. If it took them 10 hours, that’s understandable. But 44 hours is shameful.”\n\nPhoto\n\nAllan Behm, a former official in Australia’s Defense Ministry, said the Chinese military was evidently still focused on conventional warfare rather than engineering skills. In spite of its efforts to modernize, Mr. Behm said, “the P.L.A. is still built on the idea of bringing hundreds of thousands of troops into the battle area.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nChina has often deployed the P.L.A., along with a separate paramilitary force, the People’s Armed Police, to respond to natural disasters, social unrest and other domestic security issues. Tai Ming Cheung, a senior fellow at the Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation at the University of California at San Diego, said that in addition to preparing for a possible conflict with Taiwan, China was “focused on projecting power inside its borders, to ensure social stability.”\n\nIn January, P.L.A. units from southwestern China’s Chengdu Military Region were deployed to southern areas hit by heavy snowstorms. In March, they were transferred to Tibetan regions of western Sichuan to pacify antigovernment protesters. Then, in May, the earthquake hit, and they came down from the Tibetan plateau to rescue people buried under collapsed buildings.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The military’s top commanders held news briefings in Beijing to discuss the work of the troops in the quake’s aftermath, and many analysts said they thought it was the military’s first such event.\n\nBeijing asked the Pentagon’s National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which operates spy satellites, for high-resolution images of regions affected by the earthquake. China also used 15 of its own satellites to gather information, according to Eric Hagt, director of the China program for the World Security Institute in Washington. It may have asked for satellite images expressly to demonstrate its willingness to work with the international community, Mr. Hagt said.\n\nIt all stands in sharp contrast to the military’s performance after the last major earthquake, in Tangshan in 1976, when it refused all foreign aid in an effort to keep the scale of the disaster secret.\n\nChinese and Western analysts agree that the military’s lack of heavy-lift helicopters and transport aircraft created the most serious bottleneck in the early days after the May earthquake. Troops had poor communications, they said, and did not have immediate access to surveillance imagery to help them make decisions.\n\n“They were visible everywhere,” Mr. Hagt said of the soldiers, “but the actual achievements of the mission were far less admirable. How many more people they could have saved with the proper equipment, technology, know-how and training is hard to know.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo far, the official death toll is almost 70,000. One Chinese reporter, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, gave an indication of how many more might have been saved.\n\nHe said he traveled overland with a group of P.L.A. soldiers to the town of Yingxiu, near the earthquake’s epicenter. He said that they got there at dusk, about 48 hours after the quake had hit, and that thousands of victims remained buried under collapsed buildings, including more than 200 students at the local elementary school.\n\nEight hundred injured people had been brought to a clearing, waiting to be evacuated by helicopter. But by noon the next day, only about 10 had been evacuated by air, the reporter said.

Their voices are finally being heard.\n\nHONG KONG--The earthquake that devastated the southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan on May 12, 2008 could have been triggered by hydroelectric power projects in the area, experts say.Fan Xiao, chief engineer in the seismology team at the Sichuan provincial land and mining bureau, said in a May 22 interview in a Guangzhou newspaper that dams along the Minjiang river and at Zipingpu had created reservoirs on top of a key fault line in the earth\'s crust.Yang Yong, a research colleague of Fan\'s, called on experts to investigate the issue further."My view is pretty much the same as Fan Xiao\'s," Yang said. "Before the quake happened, we had raised a whole series of issues with hydropower construction projects, especially the dams along the Minjiang river valley and at Zipingpu.""It\'s internationally accepted that reservoirs play a part in triggering earthquakes.""With regard to Zipingpu, the connection to the Wenchuan earthquake needs further confirmation from other seismologists," Yang said.Fan Xiao first cautioned about the potential danger of the Zipingpu dam in the Nov. 2004 issue of. After the May earthquake last year, he revisited the issue in the June 2008 issue of the same magazine. He and the magazine were both subsequently criticized in the Chinese media for "spreading rumors" based on "speculations."But the Jan. 16, 2009, issue ofmagazine carried an article by Richard A. Kerr and Richard Stone that gave more credibility to Fan\'s theory by suggesting a similar link."The first researchers have gone public with evidence which stresses that water piled up behind the new Zipingpu Dam may have triggered the failure of the nearby fault," the magazine said in a summary on its Web site.According to the Guangzhou-based, Fan Xiao pointed out after the earthquake that the dam at Zipingpu had been built along a fault line, leaving a reservoir more than 100 meters deep.Fan said that pressure from the water had contributed to the break-up of the earth\'s crust along the fault line.

Gupta, a top international expert on the subject, defined this in 2002 as "earthquakes occurring in the vicinity of artificial water reservoirs as a consequence of impoundment [i.e., the collection and confining of water]According to Gupta, more than 90 earthquakes are known to have been triggered by the filling of water reservoirs, including the 1967 Koyna earthquake in India, which measured 6.3 on the Richter scale.While not all engineers accept his views, the independent U.S. Commission on Large Dams has recommended that the link between dams and quakes should be considered for reservoirs deeper than 80-100 meters.Sichuan-based environmental activist Yang Xudong said development has come rapidly to the remote, mountainous regions of the province, with scant heed paid to environmental consequences."The opening up of the Minjiang region brought a lot of economic activity to the area, but the ordinary people got very little out of it," he said."Flood prevention work was below standard, because no single organization would take responsibility for it.

First was a 2007 mandate that companies with shares traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges produce annual corporate social responsibility reports. Second was the government’s “Harmonious Society” drive, which aims to narrow the nation’s rich-poor gap, address the problems of unequal access to education and health care, deter environmental degradation and improve disaster relief.\n\nStill, it is not easy for corporations to figure out where to steer their money. China’s philanthropic landscape has three main tiers. At the top are the Gongos, or government-operated charitable organizations, which are backed by the state and staffed with civil servants.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBelow that are international and local nongovernmental organizations that have navigated the arduous process of finding a government department to sponsor them and have registered with authorities. On the bottom rung are an estimated 300,000 grass-roots organizations that are unregistered or set up as commercial enterprises.\n\nCorporations and tycoons are increasingly shying away from Gongos, many of which are regarded as opaque and lumbering. Likewise, most large businesses steer clear of the grass-roots organizations, because those entities are not allowed to provide official receipts for tax deductions. (Corporations that donate as much as 12 percent of profits can deduct that amount from taxable income.)\n\n“Many business leaders are experimenting with the idea of setting up foundations after years of using other channels to donate to charitable causes in China,” said Ms. Chiang of Social Venture Group.\n\nThere are hurdles, however. The China Charity Information Center, which is affiliated with the Ministry of Civil Affairs, noted in a recent report on charitable giving that Cao Dewang, chairman of Fuyao Glass, announced this year that he wanted to set up his own foundation with a large stake, worth more than $600 million, of his family’s holdings in the business.\n\nBut the report said that “there has been no precedence of the approval of nonpublic foundations funded with stocks , nor have any legal processes been approved to allow such a move,” and so Mr. Cao’s foundation “will likely encounter problems with its registration, tax issues, etc.” Nevertheless, Mr. Cao “intends to push for changes to the existing system,” the report said.\n\n“What’s fascinating is that business leaders who once pushed the envelope in the business regulatory environment years ago are now applying the same prowess to setting up private foundations,” Ms. Chiang said. “They are studying the history of foundations in the U.S. and Europe to make their case for regulatory reform.”", 'title': 'In China, Philanthropy as a New Measuring Stick', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/23/business/global/23donate.html', 'keywords': ['measuring', 'organizations', 'corporations', 'china', 'philanthropy', 'stick', 'social', 'charitable', 'times', 'public', 'report', 'foundations', 'york'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Alibaba’s donation is the latest example of a change in attitude by corporations in China toward philanthropy.\nSign Up You will receive emails containing news content , updates and promotions from The New York Times.\nView all New York Times newsletters.\nThe earthquake dovetailed with two other developments in China, said Alan VanderMolen, president of Asia Pacific operations for Edelman, the public relations firm.\nAt the top are the Gongos, or government-operated charitable organizations, which are backed by the state and staffed with civil servants.', 'date': 1253664000}, {'text': 'At least 57 people have been killed as torrential downpours have swept across the country in the last week.\n\nThe flooding is usual for the time of year in low-lying areas of south-eastern China.

We’ll be looking very closely at how the tectonic blocks actually moved in relation to each other.\n\n“Much of what actually happens during earthquakes is difficult to view because it occurs deep below the surface.

The research team will study:\n\nwhich faults were active during the earthquake and what actually happened; how the tectonic blocks are moving relative to each other in this part of the India-Asia collision; and what is expected to happen in the future the next time an earthquake happens\n\nIt is thought that two main faults were involved in the May 12 earthquake, out of four or five active faults in that part of China. At least 22,000 aftershocks, measuring up to 6.9 in magnitude, have been monitored in the quake zone, according to the China Earthquake Administration.\n\nDr. Densmore said: “Aftershocks are expected after every large earthquake and this has been no exception. Earthquakes release stress where they occur, but they also cause increased stress in the surrounding rock, and this additional pressure has to be released. Peak aftershock activity is generally in the first few days after the main quake, and the number and size of aftershocks decreases rapidly after that.”\n\n18,000 people are still officially missing and a further 374,000 people have been classified as injured following the Sichuan disaster.

Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ: The Chinese government has put the number of dead and missing schoolchildren from last year’s devastating Sichuan earthquake at 5,335. Chinese officials made the announcement today, just days before the May 12th anniversary of the earthquake that killed up to 90,000 people. It is the first time that Chinese authorities have given an official estimate for the number of children lost in the disaster, and the figure is far lower than other independent estimates. News reports at the time of the disaster put the number of dead and missing children and teachers at around 9,000.\n\n\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Many parents blame shoddy buildings for the deaths, pointing to apartments and government offices that survived while nearby schools fell. The government has admitted nearly 14,000 schools were damaged or collapsed in the magnitude-8 earthquake. Parents have blamed local corruption and official neglect for the collapse of so many schools and for the loss of their children.\n\n\n\nGRIEVING MOTHER: We have been devastated by the loss of our child. He just passed his fifteenth birthday. Looking at this, I really want to question the quality of the school building.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: That’s an excerpt from a documentary premiering tonight on HBO called China’s Unnatural Disaster: The Tears of Sichuan Province. The film visits with parents in China in the days after the disaster.\n\n\n\nJon Alpert and Matt O’Neill are co-directors of the film. Jon is a fifteen-time Emmy winner and the co-founder of Downtown Community Television right here at the firehouse. Matt O’Neill is a three-time Emmy winner and works with Jon Alpert here at DCTV. Their documentary airs tonight 8:00 Eastern Standard Time on HBO and will re-air on the anniversary of the earthquake, on May 12th at 11:00 p.m.\n\n\n\nWe welcome you both to Democracy Now! You went to China right after the disaster. Explain what you found and why you were so — why you felt it was so important for people to understand.\n\n\n\nJON ALPERT: Sheila Nevins, head of HBO documentaries, called us and said, “Get over to China as fast as you can.” And we were driving down the road one day, and we saw a column of people coming towards us. And each person was carrying what we discovered was an eight-by-ten photograph of their dead child, and their kids had been buried when the school collapsed.\n\n\n\nIn their town, almost all the other buildings remained standing. The school was the building that collapsed. And nobody came to help rescue the kids. The kids were calling out on their cell phones, “Mommy, Dad, save me!” And they died. And the parents began asking, “Why did the school collapse? Was it shoddy construction? Was there corruption?” And nobody gave them any answers. And after ten days, they got angry, and they started marching.\n\n\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And Matt, the significance of these marches?\n\n\n\nMATT O’NEILL: Well, it’s interesting. You know, we — in China, all the time, there are protest marches, but it’s so rare that cameras get to record them and those images ever reach an audience. Now, we’ve been to China a number of times trying to make documentary programs, in fact, trying to record protests that were similar to what was happening over different issues, and could never get close at all.\n\n\n\nBut this time, because of the chaos of the earthquake and because the parents wanted us to tell their story — they knew that the domestic press wouldn’t be able to get their story out — so you see them beckon to us many times in the film, saying, “Come on. Get on the bus with us. Come on this march with us. Please, tell our story to the world, because we want justice for our children.”\n\n\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ: Well, it’s been a year now. The government supposedly was conducting an investigation but hasn’t yet released a report. And what’s been the repercussions for the central government to the officials in Sichuan province?\n\n\n\nJON ALPERT: Well, they never did release a report. They promised the parents that they would investigate, and the parents sat around waiting. That’s why they went on their march and the parents began to protest, because nobody ever answered any questions. Nobody has ever been punished.\n\n\n\nThey did buy the silence of many people. If you received money to compensate you for the loss of your child, you had to sign a contract saying that you weren’t going to protest.\n\n\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ: It’s like the Victims Compensation Fund after 9/11.\n\n\n\nJON ALPERT: It was interesting. I mean, if you analyze the Chinese response to their disaster and compare it to Katrina, they did a pretty good job. They sent the army in there right away. Soldiers, they were running down the road to build things and to try and pull people out.\n\n\n\nBut the difference is that we learned about our failures through the press. And the press pointed out things that really made me ashamed as an American, the way we responded. And we got a chance to try to look at what we did and to better ourselves. And in China, they could be so much better if they looked at what they did and said, “You know, we were wrong. Our officials did something wrong.” And they wouldn’t do it. They basically muzzled the press and tried to muzzle the parents.\n\n\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Jon and Matt, you were detained, speaking of being muzzled, as you tried to get tape out of China.\n\n\n\nMATT O’NEILL: Yeah. Well, we weren’t detained while we were — luckily, we were not detained while we were trying to get it out. What happened is that, one day after the protest, I was threatened with arrest. Two days later, Jon was threatened with arrest. And that night, we got back to the hotel, and we said, “You know what? They’re turning up the heat. We’ve had these problems before. Let’s get the tapes out of the country.” And you always have a backup plan. And the day after we got the tapes out of the country was when we were arrested. And there’s no better feeling than when someone says, “Show me your tapes,” and you can say, “I’d love to. I really would.”\n\n\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And when I was at that premiere the other night at HBO, you had just gotten a call from the Chinese government as you were headed there.\n\n\n\nJON ALPERT: Well, we’re interested in talking with the Chinese government, because we didn’t make this film to poke them in the eye. We made this film basically because the parents want people to hear what happened to them and would like things better in their country. The Chinese government really has a chance, really, to step up to the plate and to basically investigate this properly, and they haven’t done it.\n\n\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ: And there are some lawsuits, though, that many of the parents have filed lawsuits within the Chinese legal system?\n\n\n\nJON ALPERT: Yeah, courageously so. Matt knows the details of that.\n\n\n\nMATT O’NEILL: Yeah, the parents of Fuxin school, which is the school that we focus on in this film, filed a lawsuit. They had fifty-eight complainants. They were asking for additional compensation beyond that $8,000 and, most importantly to them, a public apology.\n\n\n\nWhat happened is, when they all showed up in court on the day the suit was meant to be heard, one of the parents was missing. And it turned out that that parent was too busy with the new construction contracts from the local government to come to court that day. And that’s where — you know, when you saw — we were talking about Kent State earlier. That’s where it’s crushed with a fist. You know, the Chinese government is smothering this dissent.\n\n\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Matt O’Neill and Jon Alpert, your film, China’s Unnatural Disaster: The Tears of Sichuan Province, airs tonight on HBO, 8:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.

More than 69,000 people have been confirmed dead so far, and more than 374,000 injured, with fears of further casualties because several lakes created by rockfall dams may give way and cause sudden flooding.\n\nClark Burchfiel, Schlumberger Professor of Geology, and Leigh Royden, professor of geology and geophysics in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at MIT, have been doing extensive research in that region of China and the Tibetan plateau for more than two decades, but had found no hints that suggested such a large earthquake might strike the area.\n\nThey and several colleagues, including MIT\'s Robert D. van der Hilst and Bradford H. Hager, who are both Cecil and Ida Green Professors of Earth Sciences, have published a paper analyzing the causes of the quake that appears in the July issue of GSA Today, a publication of the Geological Society of America.\n\nThe team operated an array of 25 broadband seismograph stations in this region of western Sichuan for more than a year. "Nobody was thinking there would be a major seismological event" in that area, Royden says. "This earthquake was quite unusual," and may have involved a simultaneous rupture of two separate but contiguous faults, she continued.\n\nThe region is extremely unusual geologically, Royden says, because of the very steep slopes at the boundary between the Sichuan Basin to the east and the Tibetan plateau to the west. The elevation rises sharply by about 3,500 meters (more than two miles) over a span of only about 50 kilometers (about 30 miles).\n\nThe area where the quake occurred is part of the boundary between two of the Earth\'s tectonic plates, where the Indian and Asian plates converge in an ongoing collision that has created the Himalayan mountains and the Tibetan plateau. But in central and eastern Tibet, unlike most other areas of continental collision, much of the movement of crust is hidden from view. Instead of thickening the entire crust by folding and faulting, the surface of the eastern Tibetan plateau is undeformed and is being lifted upward by thickening of a weak crustal layer more than 15 km below the surface.\n\nThe crust in this deep weak layer is flowing eastward away from central Tibet to escape from the area directly north of the Indian plate. But, in the area where the earthquake occurred, this rapidly flowing material is obstructed by a major obstacle, the Sichuan Basin. "The crust and mantle beneath the basin appears to form a hard, cold knot" that extends to 250 km depth, Royden says, that forces the flow to "wrap around the knot." The huge elevation difference between the surface of the plateau and the Sichuan Basin provides the underlying stress that led to the quake, she says.\n\nAs the surface of the eastern plateau has risen, it has become increasingly incised by rivers. Four of the world\'s 10 largest rivers, including the Yangtze, flow through the region, Royden says. "There are gorges two and a half to three kilometers deep, and hundreds of kilometers long -- they dwarf the Grand Canyon," she says.\n\nThe steep slopes within the river gorges make the region especially vulnerable when earthquakes occur, she says. "When you shake those valleys, everything just slides down into the river gorges and eventually washes out to sea," she says.\n\nBecause of the extreme geological environment of this region, Royden says, it may be possible to learn about mechanisms taking place there that may also occur, at a smaller scale, in other places. In this way, it may reveal processes that are also relevant in other parts of the world but that would be much harder to discover in these other locations because they would be more subtly expressed.\n\nThe research was funded by the National Science Foundation.

In China, however, firms that had operated under the perception that international CSR doctrines could be simply applied cookie-cutter style received a rude wake-up call in the aftermath of the May 12, 2008, Sichuan earthquake.\n\nThis massive earthquake, measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale, not only left 70,000 people dead and five million homeless, but also forever changed the landscape of CSR in China. The scale and timeliness of aid response by both domestic and multi-national corporations crafted Chinese attitudes towards companies to an unexpected degree. Firms doing business in China can learn from the public’s reaction following the disaster, and can incorporate tailored CSR principles into their core strategy for the Chinese market.\n\nIn the days and weeks following the Sichuan earthquake, many MNCs pursued a global CSR policy in line with their international standard. While some multinationals pledged cash, many others pledged a combination of cash, equipment and services. Domestic firms, by all accounts, out-donated multinationals. By May 20, Chinese companies had donated more than US$645 million in cash and goods. The popular perception was that international firms’ relief contributions not only did not match those of local Chinese companies in terms of scale or timeliness, but also were not commensurate with their presence in the Chinese market. Chinese consumers quickly seized upon this disparity by openly attacking major MNCs, calling for a boycott of their products and publicly condemning companies that donated too little. For multinational companies used to operating under a global CSR framework, the ensuing consumer backlash came as a shock.\n\nThe Chinese public soon gave these affected MNCs the nickname of “international iron roosters.” The term refers to a bird that will not give up a single feather, and its usage highlights the perceived stinginess of these international firms. The list of “iron roosters,” first appearing on May 14 included the following notable MNCs: Samsung, Nokia, Coca Cola, McDonald’s and KFC. In the face of such negative publicity, many MNCs responded quickly. Nokia increased donations on May 17 from 3 million RMB to 10 million RMB (US$430,000 million to US$1.43 million) and Coca Cola raised donations from 5 million RMB to 17 million RMB (US$710,000 to US$2.4 million). Despite these additional donations, “iron-rooster” MNCs continued to face angry consumers throughout China, resulting in severe public backlash, including protests at several McDonald’s and blockades at KFCs throughout Sichuan province and the rest of China.\n\nOn May 27, the affected multinationals met with the Chinese Ministry of Commerce (MOC) to discuss response efforts to both the earthquake and the publicity aftermath. More than 40 companies attended the meeting, originally intended to include only 10. To address the lack of transparency related to contributions, the U.S.-China Business Council began recording donations of its member companies — which were sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), the MOC, and the media — and published them on its official website.\n\nThough sensing the need to move quickly to avoid further negative publicity, many MNCs were hampered in their movements by overseas corporate offices that simply referred to corporate global CSR policies. Nokia, for example, donated 3 million RMB (US$430,000) and 5,000 mobile phones immediately after the quake, yet ranked second on the initial “iron-rooster” list. With the backlash intensifying, the vice president of the Chinese office of Nokia, Xiao Jieyun, flew to Finland to request additional donations from the home office. Management in Finland, however, noted that the company’s contribution was equal to those following similar disasters in Indonesia and Myanmar, and questioned why China should be an exception. Only after showing the “iron rooster” list to home officials and describing the severity of the situation in China did Xiao gain approval to increase company contributions.\n\nLocal firms soon found that CSR crises in China do not depend on the nationality of the firm. Despite its positive image in a notoriously corrupt industry, VanKe, China’s largest real estate development firm, met with immediate criticism from netizens (Internet users) in response to chairman Wang Shi’s initial pledge of only two million RMB (US$290,000) and his insistence that company employees donate no more than 10 RMB each (US$1.40). Wang apologized with a second donation of 100 million RMB (US$14.3 million) on June 6, admitting his comments and actions had affected the brand image and share price negatively. He committed not only to elect a spokesman to avoid similar situations in the future, but also to “resign immediately, if VanKe’s performance suffers because of my personal comments.”\n\nOn the other hand, firms that acted quickly and generously enjoyed an extremely favorable public response. Wang Lao Ji, an herbal tea soft drink, quickly became one of China’s most well-known and highly esteemed brands after its parent company, JDB, donated 100 million RMB on May 18. After the news was released, enthusiastic netizens encouraged others to purchase the drink, comparing Wang Lao Ji’s generosity to that of rivals’ miserliness (e.g., Coke and Pepsi). By May 24, demand for Wang Lao Ji was so high that JDB struggled to fill the shelves of China’s groceries and restaurants.\n\nIn general, domestic firms that contributed generously were singled out by Chinese netizens, who encouraged their compatriots to use only these brands. Local firms and their contributions were glorified in the following widely spread message, proliferated through text messaging and online BBS (electronic bulletin boards) postings: “In the future, drink Wanglaoji (100 million RMB), save your money at the Industrial and Commerce Bank (87.26 million RMB) … drive Geely cars (10 million RMB).”\n\nThe response described above was fueled in large part by feelings of nationalism. According to Scott Kronick, president of Ogilvy PR China, “The whole event was indicative of a sort of social contract that Chinese consumers have made with corporations. They look to the business community in addition to the government for support in times of need.” As foreign companies see profits from China grow, Chinese locals demand an increasing obligation to Chinese society. The perceived failure of multinationals to respond quickly to the disaster perpetuated the belief that foreign companies exploit China without giving back.\n\nThe unique nature of CSR in China has cultural roots. Historically, China has been shaped by Confucianism, which values family first before support for the wider community. In addition, the communist ethos and state ownership of resources from the mid-20th century prevented accumulation of wealth and, to some extent, reduced the need for private philanthropy. Hence, Western philanthropic traditions, from volunteerism to philanthropic magnates, have not been as common in China. Currently, no meaningful charitable sector exists to effectively mobilize and support disaster relief efforts in times of crisis. Therefore, aid and relief efforts are coordinated primarily by the government and jointly funded by the public and private sector, suggesting that the corporate sector plays a significant role in modern day Chinese philanthropy. Moreover, as the Confucian ideal of righteousness over profit guides how the public views donations, companies donating too little relative to their means are seen to value profits over morality.\n\nCSR initiatives in China are also affected by word-of-mouth to a greater extent than in other markets, and this effect has been magnified as Internet use has rapidly increased. As Internet public relations firm CIC’s founder and chairman Sam Flemming notes, “the world wide web now serves essentially as an amplifier, vastly increasing the reach and influence of the word-of-mouth conversations on brands that previously took place offline. The migration online has not only increased the potential readership of comments on brands to some 250 million Chinese netizens; these comments are also now archived, so that they are rarely forgotten and can be easily referenced again later.” Nonetheless, the spread of the Internet is also true outside of China. What is unique to the country, however, is that there is a notable lack of a trusted traditional media to which Chinese consumers can turn for reliable information. Therefore, the role of electronic bulletin boards in China has taken on astounding importance, with users more numerous and more active than in other countries. For companies looking to develop their CSR policies in China, they have to be very careful about how they market their initiatives online.\n\nChina’s important young market, a cultural propensity to link CSR and company image, and a highly vocal and active online population make CSR critical in China. Accordingly, MNCs may need to rethink their approach in China, where CSR and company performance may be more closely aligned than in other countries. MNCs need to recognize that a thoughtfully developed CSR strategy is not merely conducive to doing business in China: It’s a precondition. Three key factors are crucial to formulating an appropriate CSR strategy in China.\n\nThe first element involves organizational structure and processes. CSR requires creating the right escalation mechanisms and organizational reporting lines. Many MNCs in China were hamstrung by bureaucratic red tape and simply could not react as quickly as many local companies. Samsung, for instance, donated 30M RMB (USS4.3 million) to the Red Cross within three days of the earthquake — by which time they were already being publicly disparaged as an “iron rooster.” MNCs need to have well-established escalation mechanisms as a core part of their CSR strategy, perhaps with a set of decision criteria to determine whether a particular event can be rushed to senior management for urgent consideration.\n\nSecond, MNCs must understand the cultural context. Companies must realize that they are expected to give, and failure to do so can result in serious public relations damage. Due to the necessity of prompt action in times of crisis, it may be prudent to have set aside a predetermined budget for CSR issues. Moreover, companies should expect to make their donations public. As shown above, companies that donated discreetly risked being mistakenly accused of not donating. Some MNCs took to posting a live tally of their employee donations on their websites.\n\nLast, as Internet word-of-mouth plays such an important role in China, companies should pursue a highly active online brand management strategy, including tracking online opinion and working to stem any PR issues before they become disasters. As Flemming notes: “Tracking online opinion not only allows a company to react quickly when an online public relations crisis is brewing — such as Carrefour in the recent Sichuan earthquake — but also helps the company identify key online stakeholders. These stakeholders, who are sometimes simply fans of the brand, can be very helpful in managing the company’s brand online.” Online PR companies have been working with both multinationals and Chinese firms to avoid PR disasters and harness the power of the Internet, and are a good option for companies doing business in China where online image management is of critical importance.\n\nCorporations have been forced to reevaluate their assumptions of how to do business in China. Facing the force of the public’s reaction after the Sichuan earthquake, company executives need to equip themselves with a well thought-out strategy for confronting CSR issues, as well as a policy to harness the collective power of netizens. In implementing these measures, MNCs may find it beneficial not only to allocate a greater amount of their marketing budget to CSR efforts, but also, given the importance of first-mover advantages, to allow local managers more autonomy to act quickly in response to future situations. As Scott Kronick remarks: “CSR is in many ways the future of public relations [in China]. Companies would do well to acknowledge this new reality.”\n\nThis article was written by Ariel McGinnis, James Pellegrin, Yin Shum, Jason Teo, and Judy Wu, members of the Lauder Class of 2010.', 'title': 'The Sichuan Earthquake and the Changing Landscape of CSR in China', 'url': 'http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/the-sichuan-earthquake-and-the-changing-landscape-of-csr-in-china/', 'keywords': ['firms', 'mncs', 'chinese', 'csr', 'changing', 'china', 'rmb', 'sichuan', 'online', 'companies', 'earthquake', 'million', 'public', 'landscape'], 'tags': {'Management'}, 'summary': 'This massive earthquake, measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale, not only left 70,000 people dead and five million homeless, but also forever changed the landscape of CSR in China.\nIn the days and weeks following the Sichuan earthquake, many MNCs pursued a global CSR policy in line with their international standard.\nNokia increased donations on May 17 from 3 million RMB to 10 million RMB (US$430,000 million to US$1.43 million) and Coca Cola raised donations from 5 million RMB to 17 million RMB (US$710,000 to US$2.4 million).\nNokia, for example, donated 3 million RMB (US$430,000) and 5,000 mobile phones immediately after the quake, yet ranked second on the initial “iron-rooster” list.\nWang apologized with a second donation of 100 million RMB (US$14.3 million) on June 6, admitting his comments and actions had affected the brand image and share price negatively.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'By choosing “I agree” below, you agree that NPR’s sites use cookies, similar tracking and storage technologies, and information about the device you use to access our sites to enhance your viewing, listening and user experience, personalize content, personalize messages from NPR’s sponsors, provide social media features, and analyze NPR’s traffic.

Its tremors were felt as far away as Vietnam and set off another, smaller quake in the outskirts of Beijing, 900 miles away.\n\nLandslides, power failures and fallen mobile phone towers left much of the affected area cut off from the outside world and limited information about the damage. But snapshots of concentrated devastation suggested that the death toll that could rise significantly as rescue workers reached the most heavily damaged areas.\n\nIn the town of Juyuan, south of the epicenter in the city of Wenchuan, a school collapsed, trapping 900 students in the rubble and setting off a frantic search for survivors that stretched through the night. Two chemical factories in Shifang were destroyed, spilling 80 tons of toxic liquid ammonia, officials told Chinese state media.\n\nThe destruction of a single steam turbine factory in the city of Mianzhu buried “several thousand” people, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Tuesday morning.\n\nThe quake was already China’s biggest natural disaster since another earthquake leveled the city of Tangshan in eastern China in 1976, leaving 240,000 people dead and posing a severe challenge to the ruling Communist Party, which initially tried to cover up the catastrophe.\n\nThis time, officials quickly mobilized 50,000 soldiers to help with rescue efforts, state media said. Prime Minister Wen Jiabao flew to the scene and was shown coordinating disaster response teams from the cabin of his jet.\n\nThe prime minister was later shown on national television standing outside the damaged edifice of the Traditional Medicine Hospital in the city of Dujiangyan, shouting encouragement at people trapped in its ruins.\n\n“Hang on a bit longer,” he said. “The troops are rescuing you. As long as there is the slightest hope, we will never relax our efforts.”\n\nPhoto\n\nThe quake was the latest in a series of events that have disrupted China’s planning for the Olympic Games in August, including widespread unrest among the country’s ethnic Tibetan population, which lives in large numbers in the same part of Sichuan Province where the earthquake struck.\n\nThe powerful initial quake struck at 2:28 p.m. local time, or 2:28 a.m. Eastern time, near Wenchuan County, according to China’s State Seismological Bureau. Most of the heavy damage appeared to be concentrated in nearby towns, which by Chinese standards are not heavily populated. Chengdu, the largest city in the area, with a population of about 10 million, is about 60 miles away and did not appear to have suffered major damage or heavy casualties.\n\nBut officials had yet to describe the impact in Wenchuan itself, which has a population of 112,000 and is home to the Wolong Nature Reserve, the largest panda reserve in China. The town of Beichuan, on the way from Chengdu to Wenchuan, suffered several thousand deaths, state media said.\n\nChina’s massive Three Gorges Dam, a few hundred miles east of the earthquake’s epicenter, reported no immediate problems.\n\nAt dawn on Tuesday morning in Chengdu, clusters of people were huddled outside, many saying they were too fearful of aftershocks to go indoors. Many wore plastic slickers to protect them from a steady drizzle. Wang Zihong, 35, a businessman from Gansu Province, had spent 12 hours outside his hotel, squatting with others on a street corner.\n\n“It was a terrible shock,” he said. “I couldn’t stand up straight.

By Tuesday morning, 180 patients had arrived from hard-hit surrounding counties.\n\n“Seven thousand people have died in Beichuan, a single county, and we think Wenchuan will be similar, too, because it was the epicenter,” said Kang Zhilin, a spokesman for the hospital. He added: “The first patients who came had jumped from buildings because they were frightened.”\n\nAfter the tremors shook Chengdu, roughly 4,000 frightened patients had been relocated from wards on the hospital’s upper floors to a courtyard outdoors. By Tuesday morning, the patients were sitting in the rain, covered in plastic.\n\nA woman, Tang Hong, 50, sat beside her injured husband, Yan Chaozhong, in the hospital. They had arrived early in the morning from Dujiangyan County, one place that had suffered heavy damage. They had been inside their fourth-floor apartment when the quake hit. “It was violent,” she said. “Even when we crouched down, it flattened us.”\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Tang said she and her husband had tried to escape down a stairwell, but a second tremor knocked her husband down the stairs, and he broke three ribs. She said four six-story buildings on her street had been flattened. She also wept as she described how a school for handicapped and deaf students collapsed while the children were in class. “It was horrible,” she said. “The entire school building collapsed.”\n\nMinutes after the western temblor struck, a second, smaller quake struck Tongzhou, an outer district of Beijing. Thousands of office workers were evacuated in the capital city, but no damage was reported there.\n\n“I suddenly felt very dizzy, as if I were heavily drunk,” said Zeng Hui, who works on the 22nd floor of an office tower in Beijing. “I thought I was seriously ill, then I looked around and saw my colleagues felt the same way.”\n\nThere were reports of fatalities in Chongqing Municipality, near Sichuan, where two primary schools were damaged. Four pupils died and more than 100 others were injured, state media reported. Xinhua devoted extensive coverage to the disaster, publishing regular updates on the situation, including latest death tolls, on its Chinese and English Web sites. The relatively vigorous flow of information and the fast response from top officials and rescue workers stood in stark contrast to the way China handled the Tangshan earthquake, or the way the military junta that rules neighboring Myanmar has managed the aftermath of a giant cyclone that killed nearly 32,000 people there this month, according to Burmese government estimates.\n\nEfforts to reach people near the epicenter of the bigger quake in western China were hindered by damage to the telephone system. Some 2,300 towers used to transmit phone signals had fallen, the country’s main mobile phone company reported. The earthquake also disrupted air traffic control in western China, interfering with flights between Asia and Europe on Monday afternoon, although flight services were restored by the evening.\n\nCathay Pacific Airways announced that it had canceled two flights between Hong Kong and London — one in each direction — and had delayed the departure of a Monday afternoon flight from Hong Kong to London by 19 hours, to Tuesday morning.\n\nWhile China Mobile acknowledged extensive damage to its cellphone towers, it is less clear how much damage occurred to the separate communications network that China’s authorities maintain for natural disasters and other contingencies.\n\nCommunications equipment vendors attending a police equipment exhibition in Beijing last month said that China maintained a separate network using different frequencies and other equipment from the main cellphone network. The separate network allows the police and other agencies to respond to emergencies even when the main landline and cellphone networks are overwhelmed with calls by residents.\n\nMany Western countries also maintain separate communications systems for emergencies. China is still upgrading its emergency network by buying equipment from Motorola and other foreign companies, communications industry officials said at the exhibition.\n\nTemporary disruption of the air traffic control system in western China strongly suggested that the authorities’ communications gear might also have been damaged at least temporarily.

While China lacks an earthquake early-warning system, it is hardly unique. Such systems are still very much works in progress: Japan, Mexico, and Taiwan are deploying them, but most other nations, including the United States, are still in the research stages, says a leading seismologist, Haroo Kanamori.\n\nQuake monitor: This world map shows the location and intensity of seismic events. Red and yellow circles indicate events that occurred in the past two weeks.\n\nEarthquake alert systems furnish only a few seconds of warning, but that can be enough time for people to take protective measures. And more research and investment would improve the systems’ speed and the efficiency with which the warnings are distributed, Kanamori says.\n\nThe principle behind earthquake early warnings is fairly straightforward. Earthquakes begin with tremors called P-waves that have short wavelengths and generally do little damage; they may not even be felt by humans. Seconds later–the exact number of seconds depends on distance from the quake’s epicenter—longer-wavelength tremors known as S-waves arrive and inflict damage as they shake buildings and landmasses. Early-warning systems consist of seismographs that detect the P-waves and send out electronic alerts. Networks of such sensors improve the accuracy of the systems.\n\nIn general, such systems are in their infancy, says Kanamori, a Caltech professor emeritus of geophysics and former director of Caltech’s seismological laboratory. “It’s really exploratory right now, but this is the only way at this moment to make some kind of prediction of what is going to happen in the short term,” he says.\n\nOnline Resources\n\nView a seismic monitor from the university research consortium IRIS.\n\nSee a world map of earthquakes from the U. S. Geological Survey.\n\nJapan has the most advanced earthquake early-warning system in the world; last October, it launched a system that delivers earthquake warnings via mass media, including television and the Internet. Japan had long used a system specifically geared to notifying and slowing down its bullet trains; the new system is intended to enable countermeasures by the general public, including clearing out elevators, taking cover under desks, or moving away from rocky walls. A few seconds’ warning could also save lives on construction sites, allowing, for example, workers to grip girders or move cranes to safer positions. Taiwan and Mexico are developing similar systems; seven or eight other countries are researching them, says Kanamori.\n\nOne problem with early-warning systems is that they require many sensors distributed over a wide geographic area; the greater the number of sensors, the more precise the calculation of the quake’s epicenter and magnitude, and the earlier the warning. To fill in gaps left by conventional seismic instruments, some researchers have proposed exploiting sensors inside laptop computers to allow them to serve as distributed P-wave sensors. While laptop sensors are not very sensitive, their great numbers may have value, Kanamori says. “It is a matter of engineering, how you put together the laptops. If you have a large quantity, maybe it can be helpful.”\n\nQuake monitor: This world map shows the location and intensity of seismic events. Red and yellow circles indicate events that occurred in the past two weeks.\n\nHad a warning system been in place in China before Monday’s earthquake, the benefits may have been blunted by the poor quality of some of the buildings that collapsed. “There is no early-warning system implemented there, but even if it was, I don’t know how effective it might be in that circumstance, when you have so many people living in bad buildings,” Kanamori says.\n\nEven a sophisticated system like Japan’s is, of course, limited by the short warning time. For example, in 2004, a 6.5-magnitude earthquake struck in central Japan. A bullet train was running in the area, and thanks to the train-warning system, it shut off its power and hit the brakes. But the quake struck the tracks three seconds later, before the train had lost much velocity. It derailed anyway, the first such derailment in the bullet train’s 40-year history.\n\nSeveral European countries and the United States are conducting research on earthquake early-warning systems. But while a group of universities in California has developed and tested a warning network, no governmental system is in place to alert the public. “There hasn’t been a major seismic event, and that is very lucky,” Kanamori says. “But without that, there is no real incentive to start doing” public warnings.', 'title': 'China Lacks Earthquake Early-Warning System', 'url': 'https://www.technologyreview.com/s/410127/china-lacks-earthquake-early-warning-system/', 'keywords': ['system', 'china', 'seismic', 'sensors', 'events', 'earthquake', 'seconds', 'lacks', 'systems', 'kanamori', 'earlywarning', 'warning'], 'tags': {'Rewriting Life', 'More from Intelligent Machines', 'Business Impact', 'Connectivity', 'Sustainable Energy', 'Intelligent Machines'}, 'summary': 'While China lacks an earthquake early-warning system, it is hardly unique.\nEarly-warning systems consist of seismographs that detect the P-waves and send out electronic alerts.\nJapan has the most advanced earthquake early-warning system in the world; last October, it launched a system that delivers earthquake warnings via mass media, including television and the Internet.\nHad a warning system been in place in China before Monday’s earthquake, the benefits may have been blunted by the poor quality of some of the buildings that collapsed.\nSeveral European countries and the United States are conducting research on earthquake early-warning systems.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'Just like the Olympic Games pageantry last month, the festivities in the Bird\'s Nest stadium established new standards for dazzling extravagance.\n\nThe organisers had promised an opening gala of "equal splendour" to the show that ushered in the Olympics and they did not disappoint, creating a glittering theatrical feast with a 6,000-strong cast that included hundreds of disabled performers.\n\nIt featured a sign-language dance by a troupe of 320 deaf girls, music and singing by blind musicians and a barrage of fireworks.

"It is well-defined and has all the right features," says Mr. Elnashai.\n\nEarthquake resistance, he notes, does not mean buildings don\'t sustain damage; they do, but don\'t collapse.\n\nSchools, he says, are particularly vulnerable because they are often mid-sized buildings, smaller projects for contractors that are paid for the a government bureaucracies.

About 200 of its cities with a population of over a million are located at risk of magnitude 7 earthquake.\n\n"In this case, where the earthquake occurred, there are a magnitude 4 earthquakes every couple of months," says Lupei Zhu, an associate professor of geophysics, at St. Louis University in Missouri, and a former employee of the China Earthquake Administration, which oversees public awareness and the collection of seismic data for the country.\n\nBill Murphy, an engineering geologist at the University of Leeds in England, notes that magnitude of the quake is only one measure. "It\'s not so much the magnitude, but the amount of shaking," he says. "Some of these aftershocks [in Sichuan] have been earthquakes in their own right. That might cause some additional buildings to collapse, especially those that have been weakened by the main earthquake."\n\nA civil engineer at the University of Western Australia in Perth told New Scientist magazine that the buildings in Sichuan weren\'t built to withstand an earthquake as large as the one that hit.\n\n"The seismic code for the area substantially underestimated the earthquake strength," said Hong Hao. He said that China\'s earthquake regulations class this province as equivalent to a 7 on the Mercalli intensity scale, which uses historical information to assess risk of damage from earthquakes. That means there\'s a 10 percent risk of an earthquake occurring every 50 years of an intensity that would cause negligible damaged. Monday\'s quake was a 10 or 11 on the Mercalli scale.\n\nXinhua said more than 12,000 had died in Sichuan province alone, but the total number of casualties remained uncertain. In a massive government relief operation, some 20,000 soldiers and police have arrived in the area, with 30,000 more on the way.\n\n"Survivors can hold on for some time. Now it\'s not time to give up," said Wang Zhenyao, disaster relief official at the Ministry of Civil Affairs in Beijing.\n\n• Material from the Associated Press was used in this report.', 'title': "China's quake: Why did so many schools collapse?", 'url': 'https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2008/0514/p06s05-woap.html', 'keywords': ['buildings', 'collapse', 'magnitude', 'sichuan', 'university', 'codes', 'schools', 'quake', 'earthquake', 'chinas', 'earthquakes', 'school', 'building'], 'tags': {'Associated Press', 'Perth', 'Bill Murphy', 'Turkey', 'Wang Zhenyao', 'University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign', 'Andrew Smeall', 'Indonesia', 'Sichuan province', 'University of Leeds', 'British Geological Survey', 'Missouri', 'Mr. Musson', 'Hong Hao', 'University of Western Australia', 'China', 'China Earthquake Administration', 'New Scientist', 'Edinburgh', 'St. Louis University', 'England', 'US-China Center', 'Kashmir', 'Asia Society', 'Xinhua News Agency', 'Scotland', 'Beijing', 'Mianyang'}, 'summary': 'In the wake of Monday\'s 7.9-magnitude earthquake in China\'s southwestern province of Sichuan, some international experts are questioning the adequacy of the region\'s building codes and construction practices.\nBut there was little word on the rest of the nearly 900 teenagers who were believed to be trapped under their collapsed school building.\nMost seismologists interviewed say that China\'s quake code is adequate, if not the most up-to-date.\nChina has "fairly rigorous building codes that have been in place.\nIn Turkey\'s devastating 1999 earthquake, building codes were excellent, but "fly by night builders" had erected buildings using "extremely poor" materials, Mr. Musson says.', 'date': 1210741200}, {'text': 'Almost one week from the earthquake, the government estimates nearly 10,000 bodies may lie buried in the wreckage of buildings, but many sites are still not being excavated.\n\n"What we need is professional equipment, especially small-scale engineering machinery," said Zhou Ming, an official overseeing rescue work in Beichuan, the worst hit major town.\n\nAll through the city, much of which was levelled by landslides in the aftermath of the quake, bodies lie clearly visible under the rubble.

The government has launched an investigation, but censors, wary of the public mood, are trying to suppress the issue in state-run media and online.\n\nAn examination of the collapse of Xinjian Primary School offers a disturbing picture of a calamity that might have been avoided. Many parents say they were told the school was unsafe. Xinjian was poorly built when it opened its doors in 1992, they say, and never got its share of government funds for reconstruction because of its low ranking in the local education bureaucracy and the low social status of its students.\n\nA decade ago, a detached wing of the school was torn down and rebuilt because of safety concerns. But the main building remained unimproved. Engineers and earthquake experts who examined photographs of its wreckage concluded that the structure had many failings and one critical flaw: inadequate iron reinforcing rods running up the school’s vertical columns. One expert described the unstable concrete floor panels as “time bombs.”\n\nXinjian also was ill-equipped for a crisis. An ambulance and other rescue vehicles that responded after the earthquake could not fit through the entrance into the school’s courtyard. A bulldozer finally dug up beneath the front gate to create enough overhead clearance. Parents say they believe several hundred of the school’s 660 pupils died.\n\n“It is impossible to describe,” said a nurse standing on the rubble of the Xinjian site. “There is death everywhere.”\n\nSchools are vulnerable to earthquakes, especially in developing nations where less attention is paid to building codes. The quake in Sichuan Province has already claimed 60,560 lives, and some of the flattened schools, especially those buried under landslides, could not have stood under any circumstances. The government has not provided a public list of those schools, but one early estimate concluded that more than 7,000 “schoolrooms” were destroyed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nChina has national building codes intended to ensure that major structures withstand earthquakes. The government also has made upgrading or replacing substandard schools a priority as part of a broader effort to improve and expand education. Yet codes are spottily enforced. In March 2006, Sichuan Province issued a notice that local governments must inspect schools because too many remained unsafe, according to one official Web site.\n\nNothing is more central to the social contract in China than schools. Parents sacrifice and “eat bitter” so their children can get educations that lead to better lives. In turn, children care for their parents in old age. As in Manhattan, affluent Chinese fight to gain entrance to top schools from kindergarten onward.\n\nBut the families who sent their children to Xinjian are neither wealthy nor well connected. They are among the hundreds of millions still struggling to benefit from China’s economic rise. Many lost their jobs when a local cement plant shut down. Some sought work in more prosperous areas, leaving their children behind to attend school.\n\nAngry parents at several destroyed schools are beginning to stage small demonstrations. On Wednesday, more than 200 Xinjian parents demonstrated at the temporary tents used by Dujiangyan’s education bureau, demanding an investigation and accusing officials of corruption and negligence.\n\nOne of the parents, Li Wei, said his son was one of 54 students who died in a class of 60 fifth graders. He said education officials told the demonstrating parents that the bureau had reported safety concerns to municipal leaders in the past. But their complaints were ignored.\n\n“We want to bring justice for our children,” one father said the day before the protest. “We want the local officials to pay the price.”\n\nPoor School, Long Neglected\n\nThe earthquake struck on May 12 at 2:28 in the afternoon as 20 fifth graders were rehearsing a dance on the basketball court in front of the school. Fourth graders were outside for gym class. When nearby shopkeepers rushed over, the children were standing on the court amid a cloud of dust. “They weren’t crying,” said Chen Chunmei, 35, the manager of a shopping strip beside the school. “They were in shock.”\n\nPhoto\n\nThe main building was decimated. Parents, neighbors and nearby college students arrived to find awful carnage. Ma Qiang, a decommissioned soldier living across the street, described a sickening scene.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“We were standing on the bodies of dead children, pulling out other children,” he recalled days later. He stood in the rubble and held his hand level with his head. “The concrete was this high. On the top was a boy, and two girls below him, and another boy under them, who was dead. It took four hours to dig them out.”\n\nFor hours, this ad hoc rescue team formed a line and passed along bricks or chunks of concrete in an attempt to clear debris. Bodies of children were piled on the sidewalk across the street. By late evening, paramilitary officers arrived and ordered the parents and others to withdraw outside the school gate. Many parents considered this a tardy response that was a stinging reminder of Xinjian’s low standing.\n\n“A lot of our students came from the mountains,” said Deng Huiying, the former long-time principal. “Their parents were migrant workers.”\n\nXinjian is in the heart of the city of Dujiangyan. The lack of damage to the yellow-tiled kindergarten next door or to the Beijie Primary School a five-minute walk away has served as a reminder that proximity is not the same as equality.\n\nBeijie is the city’s elite primary school, designated as a provincial-level “key” school, boasting the best facilities and the finest teachers. The kindergarten, meanwhile, was built and controlled directly by the city government of Dujiangyan. For years, Xinjian was controlled by a smaller, local township government, which had far less money and did little to improve the school.\n\nIn recent years, China’s central government has gradually abolished primary school tuition and other fees to ease burdens on farmers and migrants. Beijing has also increased its payments to local governments for education, but the main burden remains on local authorities, and many find themselves strapped for cash or siphon it off.\n\nWhen Xinjian was built in 1992, many parents worked for the Dongfeng Cement Factory. Company bosses donated 40 tons of cement. But that was not enough. “Everybody knew they didn’t have enough cement,” said Dai Chuanbin, an older man familiar with the project. “So they used a lot of sand.”\n\nParents say the township government cut costs further by hiring farmers to do the work instead of trained construction crews. One former school official recalled that workers poured the foundation during such heavy rains that it collapsed. Another foundation had to be poured.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe school opened in 1993 and would quickly be overrun with students. The detached annex was rebuilt in 1998 after inspectors deemed it substandard. Ms. Deng, the former principal, recalled that nearby construction work in May 2006 caused the flooring in the main school building to shake violently. But she said she never had reason to believe the building was structurally unsound and never filed any written complaints with higher officials.\n\n“If I’d thought the building was unsafe, there’s no way I would have let the kids stay there,” she said. When she saw the collapsed building, she fell on the ground, sobbing.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They say Ms. Deng and other school officials told them that the building was aging and unsafe, though they could provide no written proof. One father was told that Xinjian would soon be closed. Another, Zhu Junsheng, 44, claimed that Ms. Deng filed a report with Dujiangyan’s education bureau complaining about the building.\n\n“The education bureau said there was no money,” said Mr. Zhu, sitting in front of a blue tent in a refugee camp a block from the school. “They didn’t care.\n\n“I just want to say: The government didn’t do its job.”\n\nNearly two weeks after the earthquake, Mr. Ma, the decommissioned soldier, keeps returning to the rubble of Xinjian. He smokes cigarette after cigarette and has not changed out of the Che Guevara T-shirt and blue jeans he wore on that frantic afternoon.\n\n“That’s where government officials send their children to nursery school,” he said, pointing to the undamaged, yellow-tiled kindergarten.\n\nMr. Ma saved several children the day of the disaster but cannot shake the memory of one girl. Her leg had been pinned beneath a heavy concrete slab. Two small cranes had failed to free her. Her body temperature was quickly dropping. So Mr. Ma told her father, “She can keep her leg or her life.”\n\nThe father was led away. Mr. Ma used a serrated knife he kept in his jeans. He said the job took three cuts across the girl’s shin. “She will hate me when she is older if she has trouble with love,” he said with a grim smile.\n\nHe does not know the girl’s name. “I have dreams every night,” he said. “She was very pretty. Very strong.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDeadly Engineering Shortcuts\n\nTechniques for fortifying buildings to withstand earthquakes have been clearly understood for decades. Use high-quality concrete. Embed extra iron rods. Tie them tightly into bundles with strong wire. Ensure that components of floors, walls and columns are firmly attached. Pay special attention to columns, which are the key to having a building sway rather than topple.\n\nPhoto\n\nEngineers are already trying to assess how much of the destruction on May 12 should be attributed to faulty construction during China’s long and often helter-skelter building boom. The earthquake was so powerful, measuring at least 7.9 in magnitude, that a certain amount of damage could not be prevented. But engineering experts say Xinjian and some other schools in Sichuan were especially vulnerable.\n\nSix structural engineers and earthquake experts asked by The New York Times to analyze an online photographic slide show of the wreckage at Xinjian concluded, independently, that inadequate steel reinforcement, or rebar, was used in the concrete columns supporting the school. They also found that the school’s precast, hollow concrete slab floors and walls did not appear to be securely joined together.\n\nThe widespread use of cheap, hollow slab floors is significant because numerous buildings with the same flooring collapsed during another Chinese earthquake in 1976, which devastated the city of Tangshan and killed at least 240,000. (A few buildings with the same flooring also fared poorly during the 1994 earthquake in Southern California.)\n\n“If the hollow core slabs are not adequately tied to the lateral frames, which seems to be the case in the photos, the structures are likely very flexible and would undergo large deformations under severe ground motions,” said Mary Beth Hueste, an associate professor of engineering at Texas A&M University, in an e-mail message.\n\nWhen such components are not securely joined, they are “extremely dangerous, like time bombs,” said Xiao Yan, an expert in earthquake-resistant designs at the University of Southern California.\n\nThe most pronounced failing at Xinjian seemed to be inadequate steel reinforcement of the concrete columns supporting the school, experts said. There were too few rebar reinforcing rods and too little of the thin binding wire that holds the rebar together. And, critically, the steel bindings attaching the concrete flooring slabs were inadequate.\n\nXiaonian Duan, an engineer specializing in earthquake resilience for Arup, a multinational design consulting company whose head office is in London, said that concrete flooring panels fall apart during an earthquake if not strongly attached, “like we see Legos collapse.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Chinese government has known that many schools, especially in rural areas, are unsafe. Since 2001, the State Council, China’s cabinet, has budgeted roughly $1.5 billion for a nationwide program to repair dangerous schools in rural areas. In 2006, Sichuan Province’s government issued an urgent notice calling for localities to stop using substandard primary and middle schools.\n\n“Unsafe buildings are the major hidden danger of school safety at present, and in recent years, accidents with death tolls and injuries were caused by collapsed schools,” the provincial notice warned.\n\nDr. Xiao toured the disaster zone after this month’s earthquake and found that many of the problems at Xinjian were common elsewhere. He said one reason for the widespread damage was that buildings in the region were not required to meet China’s most stringent standards for seismic protection. He also noted that China rates overall building design codes from 1 to 4. Buildings rated 1 are considered “important” and must meet stricter design requirements. But the system rates schools only as a 3, which means no additional design protections are needed.\n\nIn the aftermath of the quake, a handful of bricklayers and builders have visited Xinjian Primary School out of professional curiosity. A builder from nearby Meishan City recognized the faulty columns and flooring problems. Then he picked up a chunk of concrete from the rubble and rubbed it in his hands.\n\n“The ratio of sand and concrete isn’t right,” he said. “It fell down because of cheap materials.”\n\nIn Search of Justice\n\nThe parents of Xinjian Primary School posted an online petition last Wednesday. They demanded justice for their children. Local police officials have promised an investigation, but the parents are not satisfied. They intend to protest again.\n\nSchool represents hope in China. The parents do not express it exactly like that, but they saw education as their children’s only chance. The cement factory that employed many parents — and provided cement for the school — went bankrupt in 2002. They now collect small welfare payments and hold down odd jobs to support their families.\n\nLiao Minhui had aspirations for his daughter. He knew that Xinjian was considered inferior and that a better school might help her find a better life. So he tried to wheedle her into Beijie, the elite school. He said he offered thousands of yuan to gain her admission, to no avail. She died in the Xinjian rubble.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“I tried very hard,” Mr. Liao said. “I tried to get help from every well-connected friend I have. Everything there is the best. The teachers are the best.

But to do this, he lived apart from his son for eight years.\n\nSo last year, Mr. Jiang also paid to try to win his child admission to a city school. He chose Xinjian. To him, a peasant, a city school like Xinjian represented a step up. He paid a $1,400 fee to make the switch. His 9-year-old boy was admitted in September.\n\n“My parents are still in the countryside, but I wanted my son to live with me,” said Mr. Jiang, bowing his head and weeping. “I waited for eight years.

He initially asked his editors to keep his byline off his dispatch. “I was afraid they would track me down,” he said. “But then I found it was fine, not just me, a lot of reporters were actually doing the same thing. Everybody was free to move and free to write whatever they could.”\n\nChina’s censors operate in secret. Their orders are issued verbally to senior editors at thousands of newspapers, Web sites and television outlets so that there is no written record of their mandates, editors say. The Propaganda Department does not have a public address or phone number and does not answer queries about its operations.\n\nA handful of publications consistently skirt the edges of censorship on delicate topics, like land disputes, environmental problems and corruption. But editors who regularly defy the letter or the spirit of propaganda guidance are punished, replaced or sometimes prosecuted.\n\nCoverage of major accidents, epidemic diseases and natural disasters has long been a source of contention. Editors and some officials have argued publicly that overly restrictive propaganda controls can result in deaths if people remain uninformed about risks.\n\nPhoto\n\nEven so, efforts have been made in recent years to restrict the leeway the news media have to report on major events viewed as having the potential to “disrupt social order,” reporters and editors say.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen China’s worst railroad accident in a decade occurred last month, killing 72 people, propaganda officials jumped in quickly, barring reporters from all but the central government’s tightly controlled main news organs from providing original reporting. With few exceptions, Chinese newspapers limply complied.\n\nSimilarly, during a prolonged storm that buried much of usually clement southern China in snow and ice last winter, the country’s news media were slow to pick up on the scale of the crisis and initially provided little aggressive reporting from swaths of the countryside that were essentially paralyzed.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The clearest example of defiance in the face of clear orders from the Propaganda Department may have occurred during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Many Chinese news organizations, including the leading state television outlets, reported freely on those student demonstrations until they were crushed by Chinese troops and strict censorship was restored.\n\nIf last week’s events and those of 1989 have little in common politically, they do share a deep and wide claim on people’s attentions and emotions throughout China. An editor with the Shanghai Media Group, a television company, conveyed the intensity of interest in earthquake news in terms of viewership, saying interest levels were too high to heed orders from above to discourage frontline reporting.\n\n“This is about China,” said Shi Hong, the coordinator of the network’s news program on the earthquake. “Our rating right now is at four. That’s not doubling the usual rate, it’s 400 percent of the norm. The executives have instructed us to go deep into the frontline and send back vivid images of Shanghai people participating in the damage relief up there.”\n\nFor all of this aggressive reporting, nearly all of China’s news coverage has shied from exploring politically delicate questions related to the earthquake, such as the widespread collapse of school buildings, preferring to stick instead to the safer story lines of heroic rescues and human tragedy.\n\n“So many criticisms that one can see online have not been reflected in the mainstream media, such as why the air force was activated so late and why foreign rescue teams were not allowed in earlier,” said Li Datong, former editor of the weekly newspaper Freezing Point, who was removed for his outspokenness.\n\nGu Zexu, a commentator in Guangzhou, who wrote a column in the newspaper Xin Kuai Bao urging the opening of the country to foreign aid teams, said there had been no real breakthrough by the Chinese media in the current crisis.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“You still cannot have criticism in the opinion pages, but you can advise,” Mr. Gu said. “How you phrase things also matters. You touch upon something and leave it, or you must make circumlocutions.” The media have been faster and more efficient in this crisis than in many others, “but there has been no big difference in content,” he said.\n\nIndeed by midweek perhaps the most prominent story line had become a celebration of the prime minister, Wen Jiabao, who moved many Chinese with his shows of sympathy for the victims throughout the crisis, spending long hours traveling in the quake zone and listening to the stories of some of those who had been hardest hit.\n\nAlthough it has been consistently pro-government, the coverage of Mr. Wen may have broken new ground, when online messages from someone who seemed to be a news reporter covering the prime minister’s relief work made their way from the Internet into a newspaper, the Guangzhou Daily.\n\nInformation about China’s leaders, including seemingly trivial details, is traditionally the most tightly controlled news of all. The Guangzhou Daily report said Mr. Wen had hurt himself in a fall and was bleeding, but refused medical assistance.\n\n“The premier is shouting into the phone,” the reporter’s account of a conversation between Mr. Wen and army generals said: “ ‘I don’t care how you do it.

Thanks.\n\nAt my home in Colorado, I received David’s e-mail early Tuesday morning, as the news about the earthquake in southwestern China worsened. As of now, the official death count is more than thirteen thousand, and that number will undoubtedly rise in coming days. I hope that I continue to hear from friends who are safe. David was a student of mine in the mid-nineteen-nineties, when I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Sichuan province; that was the English name he had chosen for himself. Like most of my students, he had grown up in the countryside. Many of the e-mails I’m now receiving indicate that people in rural settlements have generally fared better than city residents. A young man named Willy described his wife’s village in northern Sichuan:\n\nIn Nancy’s home town . . . their parents were dealing with the newly picked tea and they found the house shake, and they ran out of the room, and the tiles fell off, the windows shook hard, and the water in the jars in their yard jumped out of the jar. People found it very hard to stand and many of them just took hold of the trees to keep balance.\n\nBut the truth is that nowadays rural Chinese villages are home mostly to the very old and the very young. Virtually everybody of working age has migrated, and the population of urban centers has exploded—the National Bureau of Statistics estimates that a hundred and thirty million rural Chinese are now living in cities. Construction is fast and often slapdash; during a recent visit to Lishui, a city in Zhejiang province, I was told by workers that it generally takes fifty days to build a two-story factory. This is the kind of structure that has collapsed in cities such as Mianyang, which is close to the epicenter of the quake. A former student named Lucy wrote:\n\nWe are really sad to see China is experiencing so many bad things. . . . I called one of my friends in Mianyang, and she told me the things there are very bad. Many people are under the broken buildings. Many students are crying for help. Many children are also crying because they have not eaten anything for 28 hours. Today, when I called her again, I could not reach her. I really hope all the things will be better soon.\n\nIn the minds of many Chinese, major earthquakes are often connected with political events. This week’s disaster is the largest since 1976, when a quake in eastern China killed more than two hundred and forty thousand people. That was the year that Zhou Enlai and Mao Zedong both died, and the Cultural Revolution ended. At that time, Willy was a newborn in rural Sichuan, far from the epicenter, but even there his parents felt the tremors. His mother was bathing her two sons and her first instinct was to put some clothes on them—later, she said that she couldn’t stand the thought of them dying naked. In a neighboring village, the peasants slaughtered all the pigs, even the smallest ones; they believed that it was best to enjoy what they had before the world ended.\n\nThis week, Willy told me that many people are responding in similar ways to China’s recent string of disasters. First, brutally cold weather in January and February caused major transportation-related delays and deaths and disrupted the Spring Festival holiday; then the protests occurred in Tibet and during the Olympic torch relay overseas; and now the earthquake has devastated parts of Sichuan province.

This week it also accepted help from at least three private relief teams from Taiwan, the self-governing island with which China has long had tense relations.\n\nOn Friday, access was extended to teams from Russia, South Korea and Singapore.\n\nThe decision to seek outside help reflects the fact that the search for survivors of Monday’s massive earthquake and the struggle to accommodate hundreds of thousands of displaced people from the mountainous region around the epicenter of the quake are too much for China to handle all alone, even after it mobilized 130,000 army soldiers, security forces and medics for relief work.\n\nBut the selective invitations to Japan and Taiwan — some foreign nations that have offered aid have so far been told that their services are not needed — may also show that China sees disaster relief as a tactical tool to improve ties with neighbors and soften its international image ahead of the Olympic Games in Beijing in August.\n\nChina is struggling to provide humanitarian aid to the hundreds of thousands left homeless even as it tries to increase search-and-rescue efforts for 40,000 buried or missing people scattered across remote villages in the serpentine valleys of Sichuan Province.\n\nThe death toll has exceeded 21,500 while 14,000 others remain buried, the Sichuan provincial government said on Friday afternoon. Doctors say those who are alive but buried are running out of time.\n\nIn his first visit since the disaster, President Hu Jintao flew into Sichuan on Friday. He called for relief efforts to be stepped up and said rescue work had entered its “most crucial phase,” the official Xinhua News Agency reported.\n\nMany of the troops involved in rescue efforts appear to have little training in disaster relief and lack proper tools and equipment. On Thursday, in the devastated county seat of Beichuan, thousands of People’s Liberation Army soldiers stood around with little to do. Some languidly picked at the rubble with their hands, unequipped with power tools to drill or saw through debris.\n\nPrime Minister Wen Jiabao, who is being portrayed in the Chinese media as exercising minute-to-minute supervision of the effort, sent 100 more helicopters to ferry supplies and workers into areas inaccessible by road.\n\nThe government also issued a detailed request for equipment needed to clear mountain roads. The list included thousands of pieces of earth-moving equipment, mechanized hammers, shovels and cranes, as well as satellite communications technology.\n\nA Foreign Ministry spokesman said Thursday that China so far had received pledges of $100 million in international disaster aid and $10 million in relief materials.\n\nThe three Taiwanese groups invited to participate in relief operations are the Red Cross and two Buddhist organizations without government ties. One of the Buddhist groups, Tzu Chi, had been granted permission a while ago to do charity work on the mainland. Charter planes carrying relief supplies from Taiwan have also been allowed to fly directly to Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan. Because of their long history of political rivalry and tension, China and Taiwan do not have regular direct flights.\n\nOne Chinese relief official called the invitations to a relatively small number of overseas teams “rescue diplomacy.” China has been eager to secure international good will in what has so far been a trying diplomatic year for the country, with crises involving Tibet, human rights and pressure to reduce support for the Sudanese government.\n\nPhoto\n\nBoth Japan and Taiwan have extensive experience with earthquakes. Japan in particular lies along an active fault and suffered a major quake in Kobe in 1995.\n\nBut improving relations with Japan and Taiwan is also a high priority. President Hu just completed a visit to Tokyo, the first by a Chinese leader in a decade, which some analysts expect could speed a thaw in sometimes hostile political ties between the Pacific powers.\n\nIn Taiwan, Ma Ying-jeou, the Kuomintang leader, was elected president in March. He will replace the independence-leaning government of Chen Shui-bian and has vowed to improve cross-strait ties. China appears eager to show that he can succeed.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

The biggest news is that Japanese are allowed into China. We’ve entered the big family of rescue efforts now.”\n\nWhatever the diplomatic goals, Sichuan needs foreign help. The earthquake, which had a magnitude of 7.9, devastated entire counties, destroying an estimated four million homes, rendering roads impassible and leaving as many as 10 million people dependent on aid.\n\nOne of them is Yang Jinquan, an 86-year-old who had to hobble over bodies of her neighbors to descend from the mountains. She ended up in a massive gymnasium and stadium complex in Mianyang, sleeping on a treadmill and sharing toilets with more than 10,000 other people left homeless.\n\n“There are just so many people here,” said her granddaughter, Liu Ying, 24, one of 12 family members sharing a few dozen square feet of floor space. “What can anyone do?”\n\nHundreds of thousands of people remain homeless, some crowded into camps like the Nine Continents Gymnasium where Ms. Yang is staying, others sleeping in muddy fields in the mountains. Food and water are becoming scarcer, and medical experts warn of outbreaks of influenza, diarrhea and other diseases.\n\n“Now the main job is to restore the cities and control the spread of infectious diseases and ensure people’s health,” said Yang Changjiang, 62, a doctor volunteering at the gymnasium who had spent 40 days in 1976 treating victims of the Tangshan earthquake, in which at least 240,000 people died.\n\nIn Gongxing, a farming town in the plains below a mountain range, the earthquake left many of the hand-built houses as piles of rubble surrounded by rice paddies. “People have been coming by and bringing instant noodles, but we only got one cup of noodles per person,” said one woman, Zhou Daihui.\n\nFarther to the west, by a river running past Wandeng village, local teenagers handed out water and snacks as survivors walked down from ruined towns deeper in the mountains. People from elsewhere had made a donation of a few dozen boxes of crackers, cookies and bread, but more was clearly needed.\n\n“We need bread and water,” said one young man handing out food. “Please also tell people that we need medicine. There are too many people up in the mountains that are injured.”\n\nBesides a lack of food, earthquakes also often result in a shortage of medical care, sanitation, clean water and shelter because so much infrastructure, including hospitals, is often destroyed, said Marie-Noëlle Rodrigue, head of emergency operations for Doctors Without Borders. Teams of doctors from that organization are now assessing the medical conditions in Mianzhu, an especially hard-hit area.\n\nMs. Rodrigue said it was unclear whether China would be able to meet the needs of victims trapped in mountain areas. “But they have been quick and they have been strong, and they have mobilized their army,” she said.", 'title': 'In Departure, China Invites Outside Help', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/16/world/asia/16china.html', 'keywords': ['disaster', 'outside', 'invites', 'efforts', 'japan', 'china', 'relief', 'taiwan', 'sichuan', 'help', 'rescue', 'earthquake', 'departure', 'thousands'], 'tags': {'TIMES TOPIC Sichuan Earthquake'}, 'summary': 'This week it also accepted help from at least three private relief teams from Taiwan, the self-governing island with which China has long had tense relations.\nMany of the troops involved in rescue efforts appear to have little training in disaster relief and lack proper tools and equipment.\nBecause of their long history of political rivalry and tension, China and Taiwan do not have regular direct flights.\n“It means we’re opening up and merging with international society, including the area of rescue efforts.\nWe’ve entered the big family of rescue efforts now.”Whatever the diplomatic goals, Sichuan needs foreign help.', 'date': 1210896000}, {'text': 'The woman had brought pyjamas and a change of clothes for her only child, a student at the Hanwang Technical College, devastated by the earthquake two days ago which left thousands of parents childless. "My son is studying in this school and I\'m waiting for the police to dig him up. I still hope he\'s alive," she said at the gate of the college, where soldiers in camouflage fatigues brought out bodies of the young victims of the quake and laid them in front of the gates. When the school director broke the news that her son had died in the quake she shook with grief.\n\nOutliving your offspring is an unbearable prospect, but the death of a child takes on an especially horrific dimension for many of the parents of child victims of the Sichuan earthquake, an edge of intolerable cruelty.\n\nUnder the one-child policy, imposed in 1979 as a way of reining in population growth already running at dangerously high levels in the world\'s most populous nation, most families are limited to one child. The worst natural disaster to hit China in 30 years has brought the spotlight to bear on one of the country\'s most controversial policies of social engineering, and highlighted how this policy puts unbearable pressure on many families in contemporary China.\n\nOverworked rescuers all around Hanwang were besieged by frantic parents, begging the soldiers and volunteers to dig out their relatives. One mother banged on the chest of a People\'s Liberation Army (PLA) officer – not something done lightly – saying, "Rescue my child". Clearly struggling to maintain composure, the rescuers said they had to focus on digging for survivors in areas where hundreds had been lost, and didn\'t have the resources to look for individual children.\n\nSuch was the extent of her grief that when parts of a building\'s front started to rain down on the street in which we stood, forcing dozens of us to run for cover, she remained outside the house, wailing uncontrollably.\n\nWhat clearly struck a chord with the PLA officer, and made his tough decision almost intolerable, was when the parents said: "This is our only son." In a country where couples are largely confined to having one child, this entreaty is particularly hard to ignore.\n\nLast night, as help began to arrive in some of the hardest-to-reach areas, some victims trapped for more than two days under collapsed buildings were still being pulled out alive. Doctors and nurses were treating survivors in the street because hospitals had been flattened by the disaster, as helicopters hovered overhead, dropping food and medicine to isolated towns as part of the mobilization of 100,000 troops and police for the relief effort.\n\nThe Chinese news agency Xinhua quoted government officials as saying that rescuers in the city of Yingxiu in Wenchuan county - the epicenter of the quake - found only 2,300 survivors in the town of about 10,000, with another 1,000 badly hurt. And the official death toll rose yesterday to 14,866, the news agency said, but it was not immediately clear if that number included the 7,700 reported dead in Yingxiu.\n\nAt the Juyuan Middle School in Dujiangyan, rescue workers let off firecrackers every time the body of a youngster was identified among the 700 victims, sending the child\'s soul home and warding off evil spirits, but also marking the death of hope for hundreds of parents.\n\nLi Chunyan, 16, was one of the victims and her mother\'s grief is all the more poignant because the One Child Policy means that she, and many of the thousands of dead students in Sichuan, were the only children. And, being teenagers, means that for many families, there will be no more children. Chinese leave it late to have babies because they want to welcome their offspring into a stable environment. When your teenage children die, you are left alone.\n\nThe children of the One Child Policy era are cosseted and adored like youngsters nowhere else, because entire generations have their ambitions focused on the single child. Boys are known as "Little Emperors" and are generally surrounded by swooning aunts, uncles and grandparents, all of whom are ready to spend their life savings on giving this one child the best possible education and anything else he desires.\n\nThe earthquake struck at 2.30pm on Monday afternoon, when most of Sichuan\'s children were at school, which means that when the final death toll finally emerges, many will be children of the One Child Policy. Many of them were taking a nap when the quake shook the province. One boy was found still holding a pen.\n\nOne family\'s personal tragedy was recorded by a photojournalist in Hanwang, who took pictures as rescuers painstakingly removed the rubble from around a teenage girl, Yang Liu, trapped under the ruins of her school. She had survived since Monday thanks to food and water from the workers who protected her with a white helmet. But it was too dangerous to move her for medical care, and so the journalist and the girl\'s mother were rushed to hospital. There, after doctors had studied the photographs, her mother was told that Yang would have to lose her legs.\n\nTravelling through Sichuan one is struck by the numbers of boys on the streets, almost as if the girls have been hidden. The policy has led to boy children being preferred over girls and is blamed for an alarming rise in the male-to-female ratio.\n\nEven though ultrasound tests to determine the baby\'s gender are technically illegal, underground ultrasounds and gender-selective abortions have resulted in there being 118 boys born for every 100 girls, potentially threatening social stability as more men have difficulty finding wives. In most Western countries, more girls are born than boys.\n\nAs in many developing countries, farmers prize sons because they believe they are better able to provide for the family, support their parents and carry on the family name, powerful enticements in a country with little by way of a social security blanket.\n\nRaising a girl in rural areas is known as raising crops for someone else to reap. Prejudices run deep.\n\nAnd there are many exceptions. People in the cities can have a second child if husband and wife come from one-child families, and farm couples are allowed to have another if their first was a girl. Many ethnic minorities are allowed to have two children, and there are no restrictions on the number of children Tibetans can have. Also, children of the One Child Policy are allowed to have more than one baby.\n\nThe One Child Policy is often viewed in the West as an attack on human rights, but there is growing debate about the policy in China too. The Beijing government reckons that since the policy was introduced, more than 400 million births have been prevented. The government says it has successfully slowed population growth to about 10 million people a year and there is now an average birth rate of 1.8 children per couple in China, compared to six children when it was introduced. In a country where famine is still in living memory, there were fears that the ever-rising birth rate would put too much strain on already-stretched resources.\n\nDemographics experts have warned of looming problems from an ageing population and a growing gender imbalance stemming from aborted or abandoned baby girls. Many also say the increasing mobility of China\'s population make family planning policies more difficult to enforce.\n\nThere is a feeling among the rural poor especially that there are double standards about the policy, that the rich can afford to buy their way out, while the poor are forced to endure the wrath of the state. And it is true that many of the new rich in China\'s cities merely choose to pay the fine and have the extra children.\n\nThere are no signs that the Communist Party is prepared to get rid of the policy any time soon. Zhao Baige, vice minister of the National Population and Family Planning Commission, suggested this year that China could slowly change the One Child Policy and that family planning had "become a big issue among decision makers". But the commission came out with a staunch denial of the report.\n\nSo seriously does the Chinese Communist Party take the policy that family planning officials in the central province of Hubei expelled 500 cadres last year for breaching the rules. Some of the breaches by cadres were spectacular: one lawmaker had four children by four mistresses.\n\n"More party members, celebrities, and well-off people are violating the policies in recent years, which has undermined social equality," said Yang Youwang, the director of the planning commission. In Hubei alone, 93,084 people breached the policy last year, including 1,678 officials, clear evidence of the policy\'s unpopularity.\n\nIn an effort to win people around to the idea, China has sought to soften the tone of the propaganda slogans it uses to promote the One Child Policy to make the calls to have fewer babies more on-message and less offensive. Slogans such as "Raise fewer babies but more piggies", "Houses toppled, cows confiscated, if abortion demand rejected" and "One more baby means one more tomb" have, unsurprisingly, been declared crude and counter-productive in the efforts to quell the number of births.\n\nThese propaganda messages are painted on walls and houses all over China, but the National Population and Family Planning Commission believes they are coarse, poorly worded and occasionally damage the government\'s image. "If such low-quality slogans, which may cause public complaint and resentment, are not corrected and remain where they are, the country\'s family planning efforts in the new era will be hindered," a commission report said.\n\nInstead, the commission has come up with 190 less alarming slogans, such as "Mother Earth is too tired to sustain more children". In an effort to change the boys-only mindset, one new slogan says, "Both boys and girls are parents\' hearts".

Compare this design to the that of today\'s People\'s Daily, which took a similar photo of Wen Jiabao visiting some children and inserted it into a layout that\'s particularly uninspired, even for that newspaper.

Other casualties were reported in cities including Ya\'an, Ziyang and the Garze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture.\n\nThe death toll climbed from an earlier tally provided by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, which put the Sichuan death toll at 11,608. Authorities said the death toll might change every hour, as they heard reports from rescuers who were seizing every minute to pull out bodies from the earthquake rubble.\n\nThe military doctors and soldiers have started to search for survivors and treat injured people at the Yinxiu County of Wenchuan, 20 kilometers from Dujiangyan city.\n\nThe road from Dujiangyan, a city northwest of the provincial capital Chengdu, to Wenchuan, the epicenter, was blocked by rocks and mud slides, holding up rescue, medical and other disaster relief teams. Sichuan provincial officials said more than one third of the buildings and houses in Wenchuan were leveled off. The casualties there remain unknown.\n\nTuesday morning, Premier Wen Jiabao ordered to remove barriers and open up roads to epicenter before 12:00 pm Tuesday after a strong earthquake jolted southwest China\'s Sichuan Province Monday afternoon.\n\n\n\nPeople\'s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers try to dig out a victim buried under the remains of an apartment block that collapsed after a huge earthquake shook the area in the city of Dujiangyan, located around 50 kilometres north of Chengdu in Sichuan Province, May 13, 2008.

Striking in mid-afternoon on Monday, it emptied office buildings across the country in Beijing and Shanghai and could be felt as far away as Vietnam and Thailand.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe death toll exceeds 12,000 by 4 pm Tuesday in Sichuan Province alone, according to local government. At least 4,800 people remained buried in Mianzhu, 60 miles (100 kilometers) from the epicenter, Xinhua said, citing local authorities.\n\nThe casualty figures were expected to rise and remained uncertain due to the remote areas affected by the quake and difficulty in finding buried victims.\n\nThe killer quake toppled buildings, schools and chemical plants, trapping unknown numbers in mounds of concrete, steel, wooden frames, bricks and earth in China\'s worst earthquake in three decades.\n\nChinese President Hu Jintao, back to Beijing following a 5-day state visit to Japan, convened a CPC Politburo Standing Committee meeting Monday night, and ordered all-out efforts for the rescue. More than 16,000 PLA officers, soldiers and police have rushed to the quake-stricken areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nPremier Wen Jiabao, heading a slew of government ministers and leading the overall rescue endeavoring, flew to Sichuan province Monday evening.

But many individuals, corporations and nongovernmental organizations, or NGOs, simply rushed into action to supplement what they say is an overburdened Chinese Red Cross or to help with the rescue, according to representatives of some private citizens’ groups.\n\nFaced with the potential for a grave humanitarian crisis, officials loosened their grip. They have since begun warning volunteers to stay out of the earthquake zone, citing safety concerns. But thousands are already there.\n\nIn Chengdu, relief volunteers have formed a command structure called the NGO Relief Action Group to coordinate 30 organizations. They have collected donations of instant noodles, biscuits, rice, medicine, clothes and bedding.\n\n“We realized that this is such an unprecedented crisis that we must join together to make some substantial contribution,” said Xing Mo, 39, a veteran organizer of nongovernmental organizations and president of the Yunnan Institute of Development, a school that trains volunteers.\n\nMost volunteers say they approve of the way the government has handled rescue and relief efforts so far. Some experts believe that party leaders could channel that enthusiasm to bolster their authority, just as they helped stoke nationalist anger after the outbreak of ethnic Tibetan unrest and foreign protests against the Olympic torch this spring.\n\nEven so, Chinese leaders generally treat unscripted public involvement in civil affairs as a threat to stability. The reaction to the quake in Sichuan Province shows how rising wealth, cellphones, text messaging and mass transportation now make it much harder for the authorities to control popular reaction to a major event.\n\nThe public’s spontaneous rush to volunteer is a piece of the same defiance in which media outlets collectively defied an initial ban by the party’s Propaganda Department on firsthand coverage of the quake.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“This is a significant turning point for China,” said Bao Shuming, a senior research coordinator for the China Data Center at the University of Michigan. “This is going to dissolve some boundaries between the government and the common people. People are becoming more educated and organized, and society is becoming more open.”\n\nFor many Chinese, the public reaction is simply a natural outpouring of grief and a desire to help, reflective of a society where more people are now rich enough to give back. Even as traditionalists deplore modern China’s moral drift and embrace of materialism, a catastrophe projected to claim 50,000 lives, including thousands of children, has struck a deep chord.\n\nPhoto\n\n“We grew up reciting Confucius saying that all men are born kind, but it takes a disaster like this to bring out the innate kindness of everyday human beings,” said Alan Qiu, 41, an investor in Shanghai. “People are touched by the scenes of children and also the value of life. We grew up in a society where people tend to believe that Chinese lives are of less value than foreign lives.”\n\nOutside the earthquake zone in Sichuan, the public response has grown exponentially. Exact figures change daily, but donations from Chinese citizens and companies have already surpassed the $500 million allocated by the government, according to state media. Some donations have been big, with Run Run Shaw, a Hong Kong millionaire, giving $14 million, while schoolchildren have donated the equivalent of pennies.\n\nBlood drives, cake sales, charity fund-raisers and art auctions have already been held. Other people have dropped everything and raced to the scene. Forty members of a private car club in Chengdu, Sichuan’s provincial capital, made multiple trips transporting more than 100 injured people out of the devastated city of Shifang. Others have filled their cars or sport utility vehicles with supplies and driven hundreds of miles to Sichuan’s mountains.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

State television has replayed film of herculean efforts to save trapped people, while newspapers have also been allowed to describe the horrors and graphic details of the devastation.\n\n“One of the most amazing things is to see 24-hour coverage,” said Anthony Saich, a China specialist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. He added, “Given the heightened sensitivity to the Olympics and the nationalist pride pumped up with the events in Tibet, maybe there’s a heightened sense of patriotism that was easier to mobilize here.”\n\nMr. Saich noted that China’s younger urban generation had shown little interest before in the plight of people in the countryside. “But now they are really shocked by the conditions people are living in.”\n\nDeveloping a robust civil society is considered a major step if China is to become more democratic, and some advocates are hoping the earthquake proves to be a defining moment that will inspire the public to push for more change in the future. As yet, though, nongovernmental organization’s are still playing a very minor role, and Mr. Xing of the Yunnan Institute acknowledged that merely being allowed at the scene did not mean that private groups were having the sort of impact they desired.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“The most frustrating thing is that transportation is a big headache,” he said. “We have so much cargo stuck on the way. We know thousands of people are in need urgently. But we simply cannot get to them.”\n\nThere are also a few emerging warning signals. Some companies are now requiring employees to make contributions rather than encouraging volunteerism. Bloggers have hectored celebrities, including the basketball star Yao Ming, whose relief donations are not deemed big enough. The torrent of contributions inevitably raises the specter of corruption and concerns about whether the money will be well spent. Government officials are starting to seek out experts on how to make rescue efforts more efficient.\n\nFor now, though, the huge public response, and its often chaotic, ad hoc nature, is evident in much of the earthquake zone. State media reported that the first private volunteers to arrive at the scene were a rescue team organized by the president of a Jiangsu Province investment firm. Since then, a passionate contingent of private citizens has steadily arrived.\n\nHere in the remote village of Luchi, the local glass factory is a shattered husk while clusters of brick farmhouses are leveled. For Liu Lie, 67, a rice farmer, the situation is dire. He is sleeping with seven family members under a plastic tarp. Every wall of his home has been destroyed. But at the edge of his tarp, Mr. Liu pointed to stacks of bottled water, boxes of snacks and food and two bags of rice — all donations from volunteers who came here.\n\n“They are coming because they love the Chinese people,” Mr. Liu said. “You have to understand the difference between the old society and new society. Twenty years ago, we didn’t have food to eat. Now people are bringing us supplies from Guangzhou and all over the country.”\n\nMr. Liu must still rebuild his home and restart his life long after the volunteers have returned to their regular lives. His wife, Guo Bihua, 63, is worried. “I’m worried about how we will build the house,” she said. “I’m old.”\n\nNot far away, Mr. Hao, the psychologist, was just arriving with two other bikers, including Larry Wang, a Chinese who spent 30 years living in New York City. They had met in Chengdu and were riding through devastated rural areas to provide counseling. Mr. Hao lives in the teeming export city of Shenzhen and had two weeks of supplies stuffed inside a backpack.\n\nHe said he was excited to talk to survivors, especially children, and to help them cope. But do not tell his wife. “My wife doesn’t know I’m here,” he admitted. “She would be too scared. She thinks I’m in Guangzhou.”", 'title': 'Many Hands, Not Held by China, Aid in Quake', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/20/world/asia/20citizens.html', 'keywords': ['hands', 'chinese', 'mr', 'china', 'relief', 'volunteers', 'society', 'aid', 'private', 'quake', 'rescue', 'held', 'public', 'donations', 'york'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'When the quake struck, party officials initially assigned oversight of private relief efforts to the Communist Youth League, the political base of President Hu Jintao.\nIn Chengdu, relief volunteers have formed a command structure called the NGO Relief Action Group to coordinate 30 organizations.\nMost volunteers say they approve of the way the government has handled rescue and relief efforts so far.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story“This is a significant turning point for China,” said Bao Shuming, a senior research coordinator for the China Data Center at the University of Michigan.\nBloggers have hectored celebrities, including the basketball star Yao Ming, whose relief donations are not deemed big enough.', 'date': 1211241600}, {'text': 'The Sichuan quake was one of several disasters to strike Asia in 2008 The past year has been one of the most devastating ever in terms of natural disasters, one of the world\'s biggest re-insurance companies has said. Munich Re said the impact of the disasters was greater than in 2007 in both human and economic terms. The company suggested climate change was boosting the destructive power of disasters like hurricanes and flooding. It has called for stricter curbs on emissions to prevent further uncontrollable weather scenarios. Although there were fewer "loss-producing events" in 2008 than in the previous year, the impact of natural disasters was higher, said Munich Re in its annual assessment. More than 220,000 people died in events like cyclones, earthquakes and flooding, the most since 2004, the year of the Asian tsunami. Meanwhile, overall global losses totalled about $200bn (£137bn), with uninsured losses totalling $45bn, about 50% more than in 2007. Climate change has already started and is very probably contributing to increasingly frequent weather extremes and ensuing natural catastrophes\n\nTorsten Jeworrek\n\nMunich Re This makes 2008 the third most expensive year on record, after 1995, when the Kobe earthquake struck Japan, and 2005, the year of Hurricane Katrina in the US. Torsten Jeworrek of Munich Re said the pattern continued a long-term trend already observed. "Climate change has already started and is very probably contributing to increasingly frequent weather extremes and ensuing natural catastrophes," he said. Uninsured Asia was the continent worst hit by natural disasters in 2008, Munich Re reported. The year saw five major hurricanes in the North Atlantic Cyclone Nargis in Burma killed an estimated 130,000 people and devastated much of the low-lying Irrawaddy Delta region, while the earthquake which struck China\'s Sichuan province in May left an estimated 70,000 dead and millions homeless. Munich Re said the losses of $85bn made Sichuan the second most expensive earthquake after Kobe. Although Nargis and the Sichuan quake brought the biggest cost in terms of human lives, the economic losses were mostly uninsured. The most expensive single event in 2008 was Hurricane Ike, which brought $30bn in losses. It was one of five major hurricanes in the North Atlantic over the year, which saw a total of 16 tropical storms. In addition, roughly 1,700 tornadoes across the US caused several billion dollars of damage, as did periods of low pressure weather activity in Europe. If we delay too long, it will be very costly for future generations\n\nMr Jeworrek Munich Re quoted World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) figures showing that 2008 was the 10th warmest year since reliable records began, meaning that the 10 warmest years on record all occurred in the past 12 years. "It is now very probable that the progressive warming of the atmosphere is due to the greenhouse gases emitted by human activity," said Prof Peter Hoppe, head of Munich Re\'s Geo Risks Research. "The logic is clear: when temperatures increase there is more evaporation and the atmosphere has a greater capacity to absorb water vapour, with the result that its energy content is higher. "The weather machine runs into top gear, bringing more intense severe weather events with corresponding effects in terms of losses." The company said world leaders must put in place "effective and binding rules on CO2 emissions" to curb climate change and ensure that "future generations do not have to live with weather scenarios that are difficult to control". "If we delay too long, it will be very costly for future generations," said Mr Jeworrek.\n\n\n\nBookmark with: Delicious\n\nDigg\n\nreddit\n\nFacebook\n\nStumbleUpon What are these?

Internet users have debated how to apportion blame for shoddy building work, as well as rallying praise for emergency services and politicians seen to have done a good job.\n\nOther local officials have been vilified by name for a variety of offences, some relatively trivial, such as smiling too much during visits by their superiors.\n\nSome plotlines have been wild, such as those which have discussed whether fortune-tellers could have foretold disaster, but few have hit upon such a sensitive topic as Mr Fan.\n\nHe was not the first to raise the issue. Many news reports have focused on stories of teachers putting children first, almost certainly representing the vast majority, such as that of another teacher, Tan Qianqiu, whose body was found shielding four of his pupils, all of them alive.\n\nBut some schools were uneasy that their teachers had a higher survival rate than pupils.\n\nOne such was Juyuan School, where hundreds of pupils died - parents say 500 to 700 though the official number is 278 out of 900 - but only six out of 80 teachers. Parents pointed out that teachers stood nearest the doors.\n\nBut Mr Fan went further, attempting to justify his abandonment of his pupils, who all survived the quake.\n\n"I didn\'t cause the earthquake, so I have no reason to feel guilty," he said in an interview. "When I got back to the classroom, the students were all fine."\n\nHe also risked angering those closer to him, saying he would not have tried to save his own mother if she had been present, though he might have made an exception to his general rule for his one-year-old daughter.\n\nHe pointed out that education law does not demand that a teacher save his pupils during an earthquake.\n\n"If every teacher was like Mr Tan, then we\'d have no more heroes," he said. "I admire heroes like Mr. Tan, but I can\'t do that myself. I love my life more."\n\nNow the head of the private school where Mr Fan worked is under pressure to fire the teacher, and publicly questioned Mr Fan\'s wisdom in being so frank.

The new technology controls the path of surface waves which are the most damaging and responsible for much of the destruction which follows earthquakes.\n\nThe technology involves the use of concentric rings of plastic which could be fitted to the Earth’s surface to divert surface waves. By controlling the stiffness and elasticity of the rings, waves travelling through the ‘cloak’ pass smoothly into the material and are compressed into small fluctuations in pressure and density. The path of the surface waves can be made into an arc that directs the waves outside the protective cloak. The technique could be applied to buildings by installing the rings into foundations.\n\nSebastien Guenneau, from the University’s Department of Mathematics, who developed the technology with Stefan Enoch and Mohamed Farhat from the Fresnel Institute (CNRS) in Marseilles, France, explained: “We are able to ‘tune’ the cloak to the differing frequencies of incoming waves which means we can divert waves of a variety of frequencies. For each small frequency range, there is a pair of rings which does most of the work and these move about a lot – bending up and down – when they are hit by a wave at their frequency.\n\n“The waves are then directed outside the cloak where they return to their previous size. The cloak does not reflect waves – they continue to travel behind it with the same intensity. At this stage, therefore, we can only transfer the risk from one area to another, rather than eliminate it completely.”\n\nHe added: “This work has enormous potential in offering protection for densely populated areas of the world at risk from earthquakes. The challenge now is to turn our theories into real applications that can save lives – small scale experiments are underway.”\n\nSeismic waves also include coupled pressure and shear body waves which are less destructive than surface waves. Sebastien Guenneau and Sasha Movchan at the University of Liverpool, together with Michele Brun at Cagliari University, have designed an ‘elastic’ cloak to protect against these particular seismic waves and the team is currently seeking a suitable material to accommodate the elastic parameters of the cloak.', 'title': "'Invisibility Cloak' Could Protect Against Earthquakes", 'url': 'https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090720105125.htm', 'keywords': ['cloak', 'surface', 'seismic', 'university', 'small', 'earthquakes', 'work', 'rings', 'travel', 'waves', 'protect', 'technology', 'invisibility'], 'tags': {'Tsunamis', 'Physics', 'Albert Einstein', 'Wildfires', 'Optics', 'Earthquakes', 'Natural Disasters', 'Quantum Physics'}, 'summary': 'Research at the University of Liverpool has shown it is possible to develop an ‘invisibility cloak’ to protect buildings from earthquakes.\nThe seismic waves produced by earthquakes include body waves which travel through the earth and surface waves which travel across it.\nThe new technology controls the path of surface waves which are the most damaging and responsible for much of the destruction which follows earthquakes.\nThe technology involves the use of concentric rings of plastic which could be fitted to the Earth’s surface to divert surface waves.\nThe path of the surface waves can be made into an arc that directs the waves outside the protective cloak.', 'date': 1247097600}, {'text': 'CHENGDU, China (CNN) -- Rainy weather and poor logistics thwarted efforts by relief troops who walked for hours over rock, debris and mud on Tuesday in hopes of reaching the worst-hit area of an earthquake that killed nearly 10,000 in central China, state-run media reported.\n\nSetting out from Maerkang in Sichuan Province at 8 p.m. Monday, the 100 or so troops had to travel 200 kilometers (124 miles) to go before reaching Wenchuan, the epicenter of the quake, also in the province, Xinhua reported.

One trillion yuan (about $146 billion) was given for rebuilding, but some claim the money was used for luxury goods.\n\nThe Sichuan Earthquake, otherwise known as the Wenchuan Earthquake due to its epicenter, absolutely ravaged mainland China. The quake measured in at an 8.0 magnitude and is regarded as the nineteenth deadliest in history, taking the lives of at least 87,000 people, leaving 18,000 missing, more than 374,000 injured and millions homeless. To put that into perspective, the 1906 San Fransisco earthquake was a 7.8 magnitude, but only took the lives of an estimated 700 people.\n\nIn November of 2008, only a few months after the earthquake, the central Chinese government announced it would spend 1 trillion yuan ($146 billion U.S.) to help with the rebuild and rescue efforts.\n\nAfter investigating China\'s National Audit Office, it was found that there have been close to 2,000 complaints of corrupt behavior with some local city officials exaggerating the death tolls in their counties in order to gain a larger portion of the relief aid. The tourism bureau and transport department of Chongzhou City filed their paperwork twice allowing them to snag 1.23 billion yuan ($180 million U.S.) of additional aid.\n\nA small portion of the 1 trillion yuan was supposedly sent to Beichuan, to be handled by the Beichuan local government, and now news reports are coming to light stating that the central Chinese city of Beichuan has also been involved in scandolous uses of the relief aid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeichuan County has roughly 160,156 people occupying its borders and only 20,000 living in the town itself. The city became well known after 80% of the city\'s buildings were severely damaged or collapsed and for being the location of the Beichuan High School where more than 1,000 students were killed after two of the school\'s main buildings collapsed.\n\nQuestions have been raised recently about local officials receiving large bonuses and acquiring luxury vehicles in the last couple of months and upon an official investigation probing the Mianyang Purchasing Network, the company that handles the local governments large purchases, certain documents have briefly surfaced. We say briefly because just as soon as they surfaced they were apparently deleted from Mianyang\'s official records, in hopes to never be seen again. Luckily, they weren\'t the only holders of these documents and they\'ve finally been leaked to the media. The documents show that from the time the Beichuan government received the domestic support money, millions of yuan had been spent on high-end luxury vehicles.\n\nAccording to MOP:\n\n"Beichuan\'s go-vern-ment purchased one Toyota Land Cruiser, the most expensive V8 configuration, price 1.1 million RMB (or $160,653 U.S.) - the lowest version is only 700,000+ RMB, but a six cylinder is not impressive. I discovered a wide variety of brands and models amongst the disaster area purchased vehicle, but with almost every model, relatively higher-end versions wer chose. For example, a Toyota Prado was purchased with a navigation system. The earthquake must have ruined the disaster area\'s geography so much that the leaders no longer remember the roads."\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, the vehicle spending tally is apparently 5,541,959 yuan or $744,887 (U.S.). The amount of money spent on the luxury goods pales in comparison to the total relief of 1 trillion yuan ($146 billion U.S.) and while most of the vehicles listed are not what we\'d consider luxurious in the U.S., the Chinese considered them to be excessive purchases made by taking advantage of a very loosely-tracked central government relief fund. We understand that many of the Beichuan government\'s vehicles were likely destroyed in the earthquake, though the majority of the new vehicles were purchased with additional unnecessary options or were simply the more expensive upmarket version of that particular model.\n\nAccording to MOP, the various vehicles purchased by the Beichuan local government were the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nToyota Land Cruiser Prado Toyota Camry Hyundai Tucson Nissan X-Trail\n\n1.

Phone lines to the Sichuan Civil Affairs Department in the province\'s capital, Chengdu, which handles adoptions in the region, have been jammed since soon after the quake on May 12, with tens of thousands of couples offering their services as prospective parents.\n\nThere has been a widespread outpouring of grief and sympathy for the 5,500 children whose parents are dead or missing, fuelled by images of orphans wearing refugee tags. With 18,618 people still unaccounted for, the number of children left alone is expected to rise.\n\nMany couples seeking to adopt earthquake orphans are also motivated by the chance to get around China\'s one-child policy.\n\n"I think if two kids grow up together then they can help each other and they will be more rounded people. My neighbour has two children and I can see that her children are more considerate and nicer to their parents, unlike my only son who is really spoiled," said Mrs Li, an accountant from Huai\'an in Jiangsu Province.\n\nLike many of the couples, Mrs Li and her civil servant husband would like to adopt a girl to be a sister to her nine-year-old son. "I already have a boy, really a naughty one," she said. "It makes a nice balance to have a boy and a girl."\n\nHer son, too, is looking forward to having a sister. "I\'ve spoken to him about it," said Mrs Li. "He was happy… I can feel that he will be more responsible when he is an older brother."\n\nBut Mrs Li faces stiff competition. The Chaoyang district branch of the Beijing Civil Affairs Department, just one of 16 such offices in the Chinese capital, said that more than a thousand couples hoping to adopt a Sichuan orphan had already registered with them.\n\nTraditionally, the Chinese have been reluctant to adopt children not related to them, believing they should stay with family members, an attitude that has begun to change. But Chinese law makes adopting complex and time-consuming.\n\n"We didn\'t have the time or the energy to deal with the process before," said Wang Dexin, a Beijing factory owner. Mr Wang and his wife, Zhao Lingdi, are childless.\n\nThere are signs that the government will suspend its rigid rules on adoption for the Sichuan orphans. The Population and Family Planning Commission in Chengdu has already said that it will allow childless couples who adopt a quake orphan to have a child of their own in the future. Parents whose only child was severely injured will also be allowed to have another one.\n\nBut many experts question whether those wishing to adopt will be able to cope with children who have been traumatised by the loss of their parents. "You can\'t just place a child in a family that doesn\'t fully understand the issues the child is dealing with," said Deborah Barry, the child protection adviser for the charity Save the Children, who is working in the earthquake zone.\n\n"Ideally, we\'d like them to stay with family members."\n\nHeavy rain has now added to the problems for the survivors in Sichuan province.

In a country where many millions live in poverty and thousands perish each year in mine accidents, for example, Mr. Wen ordered shortly after the quake that lives must be saved “at any cost.” And while Mr. Wen is not known to have supported any substantive political change during his first five-year term as prime minister, his frequent calls for more democratic-style consultation with ordinary people and for greater economic parity have resonated with the poor.\n\nPhoto\n\n“Wen’s efforts will absolutely leave a long-lasting influence on government work in the future,” said Fang Ning, a political scientist at the China Academy of Social Science in Beijing. “His quick response and immediate appearance will set a precedent for other officials.”\n\nIt is difficult to know if the rescue effort Mr. Wen has led will ultimately be judged a success. And it is unlikely that the unusually vigorous press coverage of the quake and of Mr. Wen’s hands-on role in managing the rescue effort signal a shift away from strict censorship.\n\nBut Mr. Wen and his boss, President Hu Jintao, do seem inclined to show the world a kindler, gentler side of official China in advance of the Olympic Games. After the international backlash over China’s crackdown on ethnic Tibetans, the leaders have used the earthquake in an effort to show that their authoritarian government can be responsive, even populist, at crucial moments.\n\n“I think the earthquake really has the potential to change things,” said Cheng Li, a senior fellow of the Brookings Institution, who argues that Mr. Wen — whose second appointed term expires in 2012 — is one of China’s brightest and most pragmatic modern leaders. Even before his actions in Sichuan, he said, Mr. Wen was a muscular champion for China’s have-nots, an advocate of broadening the use of legal norms to help govern the country, and a bulwark against party conservatives. “A lot of Chinese have been overwhelmed by Wen and his sincerity, honesty and humanity,” Dr. Li said. “Not many leaders have his qualities.”\n\nMr. Wen often talks about democracy but is not a proponent of Western-style democratic reforms. He remains an unwavering advocate of single-party rule, and he has taken a hard line on Tibet, accusing the Dalai Lama of instigating the ethnic Tibetan unrest in March. In public statements, he has said China is unafraid to use its military might to prevent Taiwan from declaring independence from the mainland.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDespite Mr. Wen’s well-tended image as an apolitical pragmatist, cynics note that he did not earn his lofty post by playing nice. “It takes a considerable amount of political skill and cunning to become premier of China,” said Fred Teiwes, a professor of Chinese politics at the University of Sydney in Australia.\n\nMr. Wen is nothing if not the consummate survivor. A lifelong technocrat, he made his way to the top of the heap by pleasing his superiors, hewing to the party line and making few enemies. A trained geologist who comes from a family of teachers, he is sometimes ridiculed for indecisiveness and for long-winded speeches flecked with quotations from Descartes and classical Chinese poetry. In the 1980s he served as a top aide to successive party bosses, Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang; both leaders were purged after opposing harsh crackdowns on liberal forces in society, but Mr. Wen went on to serve in senior posts under their more conservative successors.\n\nPhoto\n\nAs with most Chinese leaders, much about him remains a mystery. But he presents himself as self-effacing and penurious. For more than a decade, he wore the same dull green overcoat. Unlike most of his fellow cadres, he refuses to tint his graying hair with gobs of black dye.\n\nIn contrast to Mr. Hu, an opaque and aloof statesman, Mr. Wen favors a colloquial speaking style, even if his comments always hew closely to the party script. Unlike his predecessor, Zhu Rongji, who was known for his jocular manner and snap decisions, Mr. Wen, when faced with tough economic policy choices, will often spend days ruminating and consulting before deferring to fellow members of the ruling Politburo Standing Committee for a collective decision, party officials have said.\n\n“He may not be a good leader,” said Dr. Li, of Brookings, “but the perception out there is that he’s a good person.”\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In the days that followed, he was frequently shown hugging quake victims and promising government aid. According to people who saw him in those first few days, he cried more than once.\n\nIn recent days, a pro-government newspaper in Hong Kong and a Guangzhou-based Web site wrote that Mr. Wen had tripped and fallen as he walked on earthquake rubble and had refused medical treatment for a bloody arm.\n\nA more intriguing account described his fury when he learned that rescuers from the People’s Liberation Army had yet to reach Wenchuan, a city of 100,000 at the quake’s epicenter. Even if concocted by Mr. Wen’s admirers, the report reveals a shift away from the prime minister’s persona as a vacillating, avuncular bureaucrat.\n\nAccording to the account — which has been ricocheting by text message for days — Mr. Wen screamed on the phone to a general, who, under Beijing’s pecking order, does not answer to the prime minister. “I don’t care what you do,” Mr. Wen reportedly yelled, his face drenched in rain. “I just want 100,000 people saved.

A foundry in the province was chosen to cast the design because of its reputation for efficiency and quality. Workers finished the statue, which will stand in Bishop Auckland, despite the site being damaged in the quake. Stan Laurel, who was born in Cumbria, moved to the town when he was baby and attended the local grammar school. Wear Valley District Council commissioned South Shields artist Bob Olley to design the £37,000 statue as part of the town\'s Theatre Corner improvements. Mr Olley had previously visited the Sichuan foundry, owned by friend Lu Huagang, and was impressed by the speed and scale of its work. He travelled to China to complete his sculpture and returned to the UK while the workers cast the design. They were adding the finishing touches when the earthquake hit. Mr Olley said: "It was five nerve-wracking days before an email from Lu said that although the works had suffered some damage, he, his family, the workers and Stan were OK. "My problem with the lost deadline seemed quite insignificant. Stan Laurel went to Bishop Auckland\'s King James Grammar School "I had imagined Stanley standing scratching his head, up to his neck in rubble saying \'That\'s another fine mess you got me into Olley\'. "But the Chinese are remarkably unshakable and determined, after three weeks the statue was on the dock side at Shanghai awaiting shipment." About 70,000 people died and millions were left homeless when the earthquake hit Sichuan in May. The foundry was only about 25 miles from the epicentre, said Mr Olley.

Such a long and clear lineament should trigger a big quake. Other scientists have had similar ideas.”\n\nIn July, a paper by Mr. Li and another scientist raised the likelihood of a 7.0 magnitude earthquake along the Longmenshan belt, and spoke again of the dangers there at a conference in China a month before the disaster.\n\nWhile many say scientists advocated stronger precautionary measures for years, some also expressed a deep sense of failure for not having warned the government in stronger terms that seismic danger there was being underestimated. The Longmenshan belt did not appear, for example, on a recent priority watch list of likely trouble spots.\n\n“Beyond the pain felt by ordinary Chinese, we in earthquake science are guilty beyond description,” said Ma Shengli, deputy director of the Institute of Geology of the Chinese Earthquake Administration. “Our ability fell far short of what was needed, and we can’t help but cry.”\n\nSome seismologists also say that the earthquake agency, based in Beijing, did not press the government to impose tougher building codes in the region. So even if most buildings there had been built to code — many appeared to fall far short — they might well have failed to withstand the May quake, which the Chinese government says had a magnitude of 8.0, the most powerful in China in modern times.\n\n“The earthquake administration didn’t warn the government enough,” said Mr. Gao, the researcher with the earthquake agency. “We told them things should be built to withstand seventh-degree crack resistance, but we should have insisted on ninth degree, just as experts from the Soviet Union advised us back in the 1950s.”\n\nMr. Gao referred to an earthquake building code standard used in China. A building would have required construction to an 11th-degree standard to have escaped damage in last month’s earthquake. Many Chinese experts invoked the high cost of building structures to withstand major earthquakes as a rationale for the failure to do so.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEarthquake-related building codes exist throughout China, but experts say they have been applied spottily. In Beijing, where the earthquake risk is high, more strenuous efforts have been made to enforce strict building codes. In many other high-risk areas, this has not been the case.\n\n“Standards are one thing, and the implementation is another,” said Liu Hang, a professor and senior engineer at the Beijing Construction Engineering Research Institute. “The quake-proof level for Wenchuan’s local buildings is rated Degree 7, but based on what I’ve seen on-site, the buildings there are far from reaching this standard. Let’s not talk about whether the degree of quake-proofing is high enough; the buildings in the affected areas just have no quake-proof protection at all.”\n\nPhoto\n\nSpeaking of the capital, Mr. Liu said, “Unless the epicenter of an earthquake like this occurred right in Tiananmen Square, central Beijing would not be seriously damaged.”\n\nOfficials at China’s Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development did not respond to a request for an interview. An official at Sichuan Province’s construction department who identified himself only as Lu denied there were widespread problems of enforcing building standards, but declined to say more.\n\nIn light of the huge loss of life, many said that whatever the rationale, the failure to enforce adequate building standards in Sichuan was unacceptable.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The mountainous region outside Chengdu became a major military production base in the 1960s, when China feared the possibility of an attack from the Soviet Union or the United States. Nuclear design, plutonium and fighter jet production facilities were located not far from the Longmenshan belt, largely because the region, deep in central China, was far from the country’s borders and considered relatively safe from aerial assault.\n\nUnder Mao’s Third Front policy, major industrial and military facilities were located in the Chinese heartland rather than in coastal areas viewed as more vulnerable. “The awareness of earthquake risk has been a gradual process, while the construction of the Third Front was primarily a political decision,” said Ma Dingsheng, a military expert and commentator on Phoenix TV, based in Hong Kong. He said that even after the quake risk was better understood, military facilities there continued to expand.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere is no evidence of serious damage to military facilities, though information about them is highly classified in China.\n\nOn Wednesday, China’s State Council passed a draft regulation on post-quake restoration and reconstruction at an executive meeting, the official Xinhua news agency reported Thursday. It introduced special requirements on earthquake-resistance levels of infrastructure construction in the quake-hit regions, including schools and hospitals.\n\nLocal governments must organize personnel to conduct safety appraisals of all school buildings as soon as possible to ensure the safety of students as they return to school, according to the statement.\n\nA disproportionately large number of the earthquake’s victims were children crushed when thousands of classrooms crumbled or collapsed. Facing pressure from parents over the loss of their children, this week the Sichuan Education Bureau published a list of five reasons school-related deaths were so high. The reasons included the timing of the quake, while classes were in session, and the age of school buildings. No mention was made of government failure to enforce standards, or of corruption, which are taboo subjects.\n\nTreading carefully around a politically delicate subject, Mr. Li, the co-author of last year’s paper warning of the danger to this region, said, “Many experts have provided their knowledge and suggestions, but how much of it became a reality in these towns and villages isn’t something that’s convenient for me to say.”\n\nSome scientists said that given the known risk, the areas with the worst damage should never have been settled. “How could a populous city be built in such a risky area, particularly right at the foot of mountains?” said Liu Jingbo, a professor at the Construction Institute of Disaster Preparation and Relief at Tsinghua University, in Beijing. “When an earthquake occurs, it’s not just the collapse of buildings that buries people, but boulders and huge rocks and mud flows follow on immediately.”\n\nMore than 15,000 people died in Beichuan, or about one-tenth of the city’s population. “The ignorance of the local government or the lack of attention to implementation of the departments with real power contributed to this tragedy,” Professor Liu said.\n\nBeichuan, a county capital, was moved in 1952 to its present site at the foot of three mountains, from a nearby site that was prone to flooding. But concerns about the risk of a major earthquake have been voiced almost continuously since the relocation.\n\n“Ever since I was small,” said Sun Xiaotao, director of the general office of Beichuan County’s fiscal bureau, “I’ve heard talk about how if an earthquake happened, we’d be wrapped in, just like a dumpling.”", 'title': 'Experts Warned of Quake Risk in China', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/05/world/asia/05quake.html', 'keywords': ['buildings', 'construction', 'china', 'standards', 'military', 'risk', 'quake', 'earthquake', 'experts', 'warned', 'beijing', 'building'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Advertisement Continue reading the main storyEarthquake-related building codes exist throughout China, but experts say they have been applied spottily.\nIn Beijing, where the earthquake risk is high, more strenuous efforts have been made to enforce strict building codes.\n“Standards are one thing, and the implementation is another,” said Liu Hang, a professor and senior engineer at the Beijing Construction Engineering Research Institute.\nIn light of the huge loss of life, many said that whatever the rationale, the failure to enforce adequate building standards in Sichuan was unacceptable.\nHe said that even after the quake risk was better understood, military facilities there continued to expand.', 'date': 1212624000}, {'text': 'Death toll, economic consequences mount from China earthquake\n\nBy Alex Lantier\n\n14 May 2008\n\nThe official death toll from the massive May 12 earthquake in China’s Sichuan province continued to mount yesterday, even though reports from the most heavily devastated regions have not yet emerged. The quake, centered in a mountainous area near Sichuan’s borders with Tibet and Qinghai province, registered 7.9 on the Richter scale and was felt as far away as the Thai capital of Bangkok, 1,900 kilometers to the south.\n\nAccording to the state-run Xinhua wire service, Sichuan province Vice-Governor Li Chengyun announced a death toll of over 12,000 people, with 26,206 wounded and over 9,400 people buried under debris. Li said the partial count included 161 in the Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture, 7,395 in Mianyang City, 2,648 in Deyang City, 959 in Sichuan’s capital of Chengdu and 700 in Guangyuan City. Other casualties were reported in cities including Ya’an, Ziyang and in the Garze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture.\n\nIt is feared that these figures will increase substantially, as troops and rescue workers are only beginning to arrive near the epicenter of the quake, and current casualty figures do not count these areas. Soldiers who arrived in Yingxiu, near the epicenter, said they could document 3,000 survivors in the town’s population—variously reported at 9,000 to 12,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe other figures in the official toll are widely presumed to be underestimates as well. Over 5,000 workers were in a steam-turbine factory in Hanwang when it collapsed around them, and 2,000 were buried in Shifang, where two chemical plants collapsed, spilling over 80 tons of ammonia. Officials reported that 80 percent of buildings in Beichuan county had collapsed. At least eight elementary or secondary schools collapsed in Sichuan, as well as one in the nearby city of Chonqing, burying thousands of students under the rubble. According to a report in the Chengdu-based Sichuan Daily, 26,000 people were injured and 18,645 buried in Mianyang alone.\n\nThe quake’s lingering effects are complicating rescue efforts. The area is experiencing numerous aftershocks from the quake, some of which have registered over 6 on the Richter scale. The quake’s power and location only 10 km below the earth’s surface caused ruptures and faults along an area stretching 150 km, largely to the northeast of the epicenter.\n\nRescue efforts are also hampered by the area’s fragile infrastructure. Landslides have deposited rocks and boulders over narrow mountain roads, and telephones are also unreliable, as over 2,300 of China Mobile’s cell phone towers have ceased transmitting, and fixed phone lines have been cut all over Sichuan province. Chengdu’s airport reopened yesterday afternoon, after an inspection of its runways.\n\nThe tragic consequences of the earthquake underscore the ugly contradictions of Chinese capitalism, in which new industries are being built up amid massive rural poverty, and industrial wages amount to just a few dollars per day. In fact, it is precisely low wages and large-scale poverty that foreign corporations are seeking, as they move inland from higher-wage coastal regions around Guangzhou and Shanghai.\n\nIn Chengdu, local authorities have promoted a new, high-tech industrial park housing operations of multinational firms such as Motorola, Alcatel, Intel, IBM, and Nokia in an attempt to make the city the “Silicon Valley of China.” However, other buildings in the city and region are largely old and vulnerable. This state of affairs is emblematic of the callousness of the ruling Chinese Communist Party, which has become an agent for corporate interests as it has transformed China into the low-wage workshop of the world.\n\nEven though Sichuan has a history of violent earthquakes, few buildings there are built to withstand them. Seismologists were so concerned that the region was due for another major earthquake, according to the China Daily, that Chen Xuezhong of the State Seismological Bureau wrote a paper in 2002 warning the Sichuan would face a major earthquake in the “next few years.” However, even the inadequate building codes passed in the aftermath of the 1976 Tangshan earthquake—which killed 270,000 people—were not enforced.\n\nOn May 13 Newsweek spoke to Weimin Dong of Risk Management Solutions, a firm that specializes in assessing financial risks due to physical catastrophes like storms and earthquakes. He noted that the current earthquake’s intensity—a measure of how far the ground moves from its original position during the earthquake—was over 9, whereas Chinese building codes require that buildings be able to survive an earthquake of intensity 7.\n\nAsked why the requirements were set so low, Dong said: “You cannot require all of the buildings designed to [be fully equipped], because it costs a lot. You have to have larger beam sizes and everything else, so it’s a cost consideration. [...] It’s not like in Beijing or Shanghai—there they just pull down the old building and build a new high-rise. But in the rural areas, the larger buildings are the older buildings.\n\n“From the pictures of the schools, it seems like there was some kind of reinforcement, but it [was] not well designed [and] it doesn’t seem like the building design considered the impact of earthquakes at all.”\n\nDong added: “The city of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, is about 95 kilometers [60 miles] from the epicenter. This area has a lot of masonry building, brick building, adobe building. Some maybe have a wood frame building with some clay surrounding it. The buildings aren’t really engineered. [...] We shouldn’t be surprised that 80 percent of the buildings collapsed” in certain areas.\n\nAnalysts interviewed yesterday described the financial impact of the earthquake as minimal, citing Sichuan’s poverty. Forbes predicted: “economic damage will be minimized by the remoteness of the region to China’s prosperous and densely populated eastern coast. Sichuan, a southwestern province of 80 million [6 percent of China’s population], contributes 3.9% to China’s GDP and 2.5% of its manufacturing output.”\n\nIn an attempt to minimize concerns that the earthquake could wreak similar havoc on the Chinese economy as the February 2008 snowstorms, analysts at Merrill Lynch wrote: “the earthquake took place in regions almost negligible for China’s external trade. This is quite different from the snowstorm, which affected both the Pearl and Yangtze River deltas.” These river valleys contain important sections of China’s export industry, power generating plants, and flow into the sea near the metropolitan areas of Guangzhou and Shanghai, respectively.\n\nHowever, the earthquake may still have damaging consequences for the larger economy. Sichuan province houses 40 percent of China’s natural gas deposits and 22 percent of its natural gas production, and its pipelines and treatment facilities were shut down after the earthquake as a safety measure. Merrill Lynch analyst Ting Lu told Bloomberg News he could not say how much these disruptions would ultimately affect China’s power supply.\n\nChina faces large-scale power shortages due to insufficient power-generating capacity, and the central government provides subsidies for Chinese energy companies to sell oil and natural gas to users at low prices. If, however, China is forced to buy natural gas directly on international markets, these subsidies would become more expensive to maintain, raising the risk that Chinese industry would pay higher energy bills and pass the costs along to consumers.\n\nSichuan province is also a large agricultural producer, of rice and especially pork. Should transport and freight disruptions persist, the result could be smaller supply and higher prices for food in China at a time when food costs are already rising very quickly. Inflation was 8.5 percent in the year ending in April 2008, according to a recent report in the China Daily, with food costs rising 22 percent. In 2007, the price of pork increased 55 percent, cooking oil increased 34 percent, and vegetables increased 30 percent.', 'title': 'Death toll, economic consequences mount from China earthquake', 'url': 'https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2008/05/chin-m14.html', 'keywords': ['buildings', 'chinese', 'death', 'china', 'province', 'sichuan', 'collapsed', 'earthquake', 'chinas', 'economic', 'toll', 'city', 'mount', 'consequences', 'building'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Death toll, economic consequences mount from China earthquakeBy Alex Lantier14 May 2008The official death toll from the massive May 12 earthquake in China’s Sichuan province continued to mount yesterday, even though reports from the most heavily devastated regions have not yet emerged.\nAccording to the state-run Xinhua wire service, Sichuan province Vice-Governor Li Chengyun announced a death toll of over 12,000 people, with 26,206 wounded and over 9,400 people buried under debris.\nThis area has a lot of masonry building, brick building, adobe building.\n[...] We shouldn’t be surprised that 80 percent of the buildings collapsed” in certain areas.\nSichuan province is also a large agricultural producer, of rice and especially pork.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'By Wang Wei\n\nChina.org.cn staff reporter in Sichuan\n\nAs the closest friends or even foster parents of pandas, Panda keepers give the utmost attention to the rare species\' good health and survival.\n\nFile photo shows one panda keeper is taking care of a panda suffering the Sichuan earthquake.

Careful attention is paid to daily details in the raising of these pandas.\n\nOne common practice is to communicate with pandas, even if on tiny issues such as breaking biscuits into pieces and feeding them one piece after another, which is the way the pandas love.\n\n"Body language is also important. Panda keepers are encouraged to play with the pandas whenever possible to build an intimate relation with them."\n\nHowever, recovery from the trauma is not an easy process. "In spite of poor vision, pandas have a good sense of smell and hearing. Since the earthquake, the pandas have become sensitive to unfamiliar or sudden sounds, and often prick up their ears to identify whether something is wrong. If they consider themselves in danger, they will run off quickly and climb up a tree." Deng said, "Yet, we have been making efforts to help them."\n\nOn April 28, Deng Tao, together with two other panda keepers, accompanied six young pandas to Beijing Zoo, where the pandas will be one main attraction during China\'s National Day holidays in October.

US President George W Bush expressed condolences to victims\' families, while the US, UK, the European Union, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan reportedly offered aid. China said it would accept international help to cope with the quake - the worst since 1976 when 242,000 people were killed in Tangshan - and offered its thanks. The government response was praised as "swift and very efficient" by Francis Marcus of the International Federation of the Red Cross in Beijing. But he added the scale of the disaster was such that "we can\'t expect that the government can do everything and handle every aspect of the needs".

The administration also requested tourists refrain from visiting these areas in the near future.\n\nShanghai Spring International Travel Service spokesman Zhang Lei said: "We haven\'t yet calculated the economic losses caused by the quake, but I\'m sure they will be huge."\n\nSichuan-bound excursions are among the most popular of the firm\'s travel packages, generating about 10 percent of its total domestic travel revenue.\n\n"Given the difficulties of restoring the damaged infrastructure, it would be difficult to resume trips to Sichuan in the short term, even if the CNTA were to allow us to organize them," Zhang said, adding that many tourists would be reluctant to visit affected areas for some time because of the "psychological shadow" cast by the disaster.\n\nWhen the quake struck on May 12, 298 tourists were on Shanghai Spring International trips in the province, including 281 visitors from Shanghai and 17 from Shanxi province. They had all been safely returned home by May 21.\n\nMany customers bound for other regions in China cancelled their trips with the company after the quake. Zhang said part of the reason was that the natural disaster cast a "psychological shadow" over the entire nation.\n\n"Everybody is busy trying to help the victims, and so sightseeing and relaxation seems inappropriate at the moment," Zhang said.\n\nSecond blow\n\nThe quake is the second disaster to negatively impact the country\'s tourism industry this year, after the worst blizzards to hit China in half a century wreaked havoc on the southern part of the country in February.\n\nProlonged cold weather put the chill on travelers\' enthusiasm during Spring Festival. The country\'s tourism industry earned 39 billion yuan during the Golden Week this year, 6.2 percent less than in 2007, CNTA figures show. Many popular tourist sites reported fewer visitors during the period, as weather and traffic concerns led many people to cancel travel plans.\n\n"2008 will probably be a tough year for the country\'s tourism industry," Zhang said, adding that the cancellation of the Labor Day Golden Week holiday also negatively impacted long-distance travel.\n\nChina previously had three Golden Weeks a year - one during Lunar New Year, one starting from Labor Day on May 1 and one starting from National Day on Oct 1 - and these were the country\'s peak travel times. However, the government shaved several days off the Labor Day Golden Week starting from 2008, substituting it with three new public holidays on the dates of traditional festivals.\n\n"Frequent natural disasters would dampen enthusiasm for travel, so we have upgraded travel companies\' risk ratings," said Tang Jianwei, analyst with Guojin Securities, which has downgraded travel industry shares from "buy" to "hold".\n\nLocal impact\n\nAnalysts said Sichuan\'s local tourism industry\'s agents would suffer greater losses than national tourism companies, such as Shanghai Spring International.\n\nTourism plays a fundamental role in the province\'s economic development, accounting for more than 8 percent of its gross domestic product.\n\nLast year, the province\'s tourism revenue was 121.7 billion yuan, the seventh highest among the provinces. Sichuan received 185.7 million domestic travelers in 2007, accounting for 11.5 percent of the country\'s domestic travelers.\n\nPopular destinations included Jiuzhaigou Valley, giant panda sanctuaries and Emeishan Mountain.\n\nShares of Emeishan Tourism Co, Sichuan\'s only listed tourism firm, suspended trading for two days after the earthquake. The company generated 465.93 million yuan in revenue last year, a 24.68 percent year-on-year increase. But the earthquake would "significantly" impact its 2008 performance, analysts said.\n\nEmeishan Mountain\'s peak seasons are usually in the second and third quarters. Last year, second-quarter revenue alone accounted for more than 60 percent of the company\'s total sales.\n\n"At best, if Emeishan Tourism Co\'s business was to return to normal levels in three months, the firm would still suffer a 20 percent year-on-year drop in the number of 2008 customers," a Ping An Securities report said. Ping An Securities has downgraded Emeishan Tourism Co to "neutral" from "buy".\n\nLooking ahead\n\nBut despite the recent setbacks, analysts and industry insiders remain confident in the Chinese travel industry\'s long-term prospects.\n\n"The negative impact of natural disasters is temporary," Guojin Securities\' Tang said. "Over the long term, China\'s travel industry would still undergo fast growth driven by rising incomes.
