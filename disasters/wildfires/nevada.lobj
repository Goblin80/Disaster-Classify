[{'text': 'Wildfires were burning Monday in seven Western U.S. states, from California\'s famed Big Sur region to tribal towns and hamlets near Reno, Nevada.\n\nEvacuations were ordered in Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Wyoming and firefighters were trying to stop a Washington blaze from reaching a thickly forested security zone at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation.\n\nHere\'s a look at some of the fires:\n\nCALIFORNIA\n\nHigher humidity and lower temperatures on Monday helped firefighters battle a destructive fire that has scorched more than 63 square miles near the scenic Big Sur coast, while firefighters in Central California faced blistering heat as they worked to contain a blaze that burned rural homes and forced hundreds of evacuations near the small Fresno County town of Prather.\n\nA layer of ocean air that arrived in the mountainous Big Sur region was credited for the better firefighting conditions in an area where a fire that started July 22 has destroyed 57 homes and 11 outbuildings and is threatening 2,000 more structures. A bulldozer operator working for the firefighting operation died in an accident last week.\n\nhttp://www.yourcentralvalley.com/news/3-homes-2-outbuildings-burned-in-goose-fire-as-firefight-continues\n\nThe blaze near Prather damaged an undetermined number of 400 evacuated homes just outside the Sierra National Forest, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said.\n\nThat fire started Saturday and by Monday had grown to nearly 3 square miles with just 15 percent of it cut off by firefighters from burning further.\n\nJust north of Los Angeles, a 65-square-mile wildfire in wilderness just north of Los Angeles was almost fully contained and only active with isolated pockets of vegetation burning within a perimeter firefighters established to prevent it from burning outside the zone. A man who refused to evacuate from a home was killed and the fire also prompted the evacuation of about 20,000 people.\n\nSome say the helicopters and planes flying high above the Goose Fire near Prather are like guardian angels, protecting people and homes from destruction, CBS affiliate KGPE reported.\n\n"It\'s unsettling, you worry about your neighbors," said Shane Mascherina, who lives close to the where the fire was burning Monday.\n\nMascherina has been watching the fire move.\n\n"It came over last night, and dropped down a lot closer than I thought it would," he said.\n\n___\n\nIDAHO\n\nA southwest Idaho wildfire burning timber in rugged terrain and pushed by winds grew to 60 square miles Monday.\n\nTemperatures in the 90s, wind and low humidity caused significant expansion on Sunday. Firefighting aircraft were grounded for about 45 minutes because of people flying their drones in the area, creating a potential hazard for the aircraft pilots.\n\nThe fire closed a section of State Highway 21 between Idaho City and Lowman and destroyed two outbuildings.\n\nA firefighter suffered burns during the weekend when fuel spilled on his arm and it ignited.\n\n___\n\nMONTANA\n\nHomes were burned by a fast-moving wildfire in the Bitterroot National Forest in western Montana, but forest officials said they did not know how many.\n\nRavalli County authorities ordered residents of about 500 homes to evacuate or prepare to evacuate after the fire began Sunday afternoon southwest of Hamilton.\n\nIt had burned nearly 5.5 square miles by Monday morning.\n\n"I\'ve talked to homeowners who said we had 200-foot flames coming off those trees. This thing really blew up, and I\'ve never seen anything like it in the years that I\'ve been" with the Bitterroot National Forest, spokesman Tod McKay said.\n\nRavalli County Sheriff Chris Hoffman said he could not immediately provide details about the number of homes or buildings destroyed.\n\n___\n\nNEVADA\n\nAbout 800 firefighters were battling a series of fires that had threatened a tribal town and hamlets near Pyramid Lake, north of Reno.\n\nThe fire zone totaled about 78 square miles Monday, said fire spokeswoman Jesse Bender.\n\nResidents of about 30 homes in Cottonwood Creek and Fish Springs Ranch were warned they would receive 30 minutes notice to evacuate if necessary.\n\nAbout 600 people were ordered out of the shoreline town of Sutcliffe over the weekend, and 200 were evacuated from beach areas.\n\nFlames destroyed six houses and mobile homes, two vehicles and several out-buildings at historic Hardscrabble Ranch, according to Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribal officials.\n\n___\n\nOREGON\n\nEastern Oregon residents urged to evacuate over the weekend because of a wildfire were allowed to return home.\n\nAbout 20 structures remained threatened by the fire east of the town of Pendleton, the Oregon Department of Forestry said.\n\nThe East Oregonian reports that columns of smoke were rose Sunday after the blaze scorched about 500 acres of grass and timber along Interstate 84.\n\nIt was 25 percent contained by Sunday evening.\n\n___\n\nWASHINGTON\n\nA wildfire burning toward the Hanford Nuclear Reservation scorched about 110 square miles as it spread from Grant and Yakima counties into Benton County.\n\nThe blaze was the largest of several wildfires burning in Eastern Washington and grew quickly after it started Saturday on the U.S. Army\'s Yakima Training Center, The Yakima Valley Herald reported.\n\nFirefighters were working to stop the flames from reaching a large wildland security zone maintained around a portion of the nuclear site. Hanford once made plutonium for nuclear weapons and is now undergoing a decades-long cleanup. The zone was designed to keep people away during World War II and the Cold War. It now serves mainly as a wildlife preserve.\n\nThe Department of Energy said Monday on its website that Hanford work schedules were not immediately affected by the fire.\n\nA small section of Highway 24 near Hanford Reach remained temporarily closed due to that wildfire while evacuation orders were lifted at another wildfire burning about 1,000 acres outside the town of Prosser.\n\nSeveral campgrounds along the Naches River in central Washington were evacuated Sunday evening as fire burned in thick forest about 25 miles west of Yakima. About 25 homes in the area were also evacuated.\n\n___\n\nWYOMING\n\nFirefighters made progress over the weekend in their effort to contain several fires burning in western part of the state.\n\nAn approximately 2-square-mile blaze that destroyed eight homes and prompted the evacuation of about 140 others in southern Uinta County was 25 percent contained.\n\nNorthwest of Dubois, a 21-square-mile blaze was 40 percent surrounded and some residents who evacuated seasonal homes were allowed to return.\n\nIn neighboring Bridger-Teton National Forest, a fire that has burned about 45 square miles was 81 percent contained.', 'title': 'From California to Nevada, wildfires burn in seven Western states', 'url': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/from-california-to-nevada-wildfires-burn-in-seven-western-states/', 'keywords': ['states', 'wildfire', 'forest', 'burning', 'miles', 'western', 'blaze', 'firefighters', 'seven', 'square', 'zone', 'wildfires', 'homes', 'near', 'california', 'burn', 'nevada'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': "Wildfires were burning Monday in seven Western U.S. states, from California's famed Big Sur region to tribal towns and hamlets near Reno, Nevada.\n___IDAHOA southwest Idaho wildfire burning timber in rugged terrain and pushed by winds grew to 60 square miles Monday.\nIt had burned nearly 5.5 square miles by Monday morning.\n___WASHINGTONA wildfire burning toward the Hanford Nuclear Reservation scorched about 110 square miles as it spread from Grant and Yakima counties into Benton County.\nIn neighboring Bridger-Teton National Forest, a fire that has burned about 45 square miles was 81 percent contained.", 'date': None}, {'text': 'Smoke from Bybee Creek Wildfire drifts over Crater Lake on Saturday.

Hot, dry temperatures often combined with winds have made firefighting conditions difficult, destroying homes and forcing evacuations. Here’s a look at some of the fires burning Wednesday:\n\nCalifornia\n\nAuthorities are considering potential penalties for whoever set an illegal campfire that ballooned into a massive wildfire near scenic Big Sur in California.\n\nOfficials want the public’s help in finding whoever started the fire that has charred almost 73 square miles and destroyed 57 homes.\n\nA bulldozer operator was killed on the fire lines during a rollover accident.\n\nTo the north, a grass fire in a popular recreational area north of San Francisco has more than doubled in size in less than a day.\n\nThe blaze has charred more than 7 square miles in Napa, Yolo and Solano counties since igniting Tuesday. It prompted the evacuation of an RV and tent campground off Highway 128 near Lake Berryessa.\n\nNo vineyards are threatened.\n\nIdaho\n\nFirefighters are setting up sprinkler systems to protect buildings in the central Idaho town of Lowman as a wildfire expanded to 75 square miles.\n\nNearly 1,500 firefighters are battling the blaze burning timber in rugged terrain.\n\nOfficials say slightly cooler weather and winds from the northwest should help firefighters trying to prevent flames from reaching the small town.\n\nFire spokeswoman Jennifer Myslivy said no evacuations have been ordered.\n\nMontana\n\nA western Montana wildfire has grown to 11 square miles in the Bitterroot National Forest.\n\nThe fire started Sunday about 5 miles southwest of Hamilton and destroyed 14 homes along with dozens of outbuildings and some vehicles.\n\nAbout 630 homes remain evacuated.\n\nNevada\n\nOfficials are reporting progress containing two large wildfires pushed by dry winds through remote rangeland and rugged canyons in northwestern Nevada.\n\nA fire that has charred more than 93 square miles in the Virginia Mountains near Pyramid Lake was about 68 percent contained.\n\nAnother, farther north near Poodle Mountain, was 80 percent contained but has burned about 10 square miles in a wilderness study area.\n\nUtah\n\nPeople in Utah were allowed back into their homes after a small wildfire forced evacuations early Wednesday at a neighborhood tucked against a mountainside south of Salt Lake City.\n\nOfficials said the blaze spread quickly through tinder-dry dry grass and brush. Some fences were damaged, but no homes were lost and people were allowed back into the 39 evacuated homes midday.\n\nWashington\n\nResidents have been allowed to return to their homes after a 5-square-mile wildfire prompted the evacuation of about two dozen homes in central Washington.\n\nA fire spokesman, Trooper Jeff Sevigney, said the blaze about 7 miles north of Moses Lake burned less land than initially thought but destroyed two homes and six outbuildings.\n\nOfficials said a large wildfire in south-central Washington has scorched about 275 square miles of brush and grassland and was expected to be contained today.\n\nWyoming\n\nProgress has been made on fighting wildfires in western Wyoming, and most evacuation orders were lifted.\n\nThe only area still evacuated was Granite Creek in Teton County, where a wildfire was burning in Bridger-Teton National Forest. The fire has burned 46 square miles and is 84 percent contained.\n\n14662735', 'title': '27 large wildfires burn across Western states', 'url': 'https://www.bendbulletin.com/localstate/4552484-151/27-large-wildfires-burn-across-western-states', 'keywords': ['states', '27', 'wildfire', 'burning', 'miles', 'press', 'associated', 'western', 'large', 'square', 'lake', 'wildfires', 'homes', 'near', 'burn', 'creek'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': '(Cheryl Chipman / Inciweb.gov via The Associated Press) 5436925Smoke from Bybee Creek Wildfire drifts over Crater Lake on Saturday.\nThe wildfire burning west of Crater Lake National Park has grown to more than 700 acres as of Wednesday.\n(Kent Porter / The Press Democrat via The Associated Press) - BulletinA- A+The Associated PressFederal officials say 27 large wildfires are burning in the West.\nThe blaze has charred more than 7 square miles in Napa, Yolo and Solano counties since igniting Tuesday.\nIt prompted the evacuation of an RV and tent campground off Highway 128 near Lake Berryessa.', 'date': 1470297760}, {'text': 'Illegal campfire sparked huge Big Sur-area wildfire\n\nA devastating coastal California wildfire that’s destroyed 57 homes and caused the death of a bulldozer driver was sparked by an illegal campfire, authorities said Tuesday as they asked for help finding the culprit.\n\nWhoever built and then abandoned the fire around July 22 in the Garrapata State Park could face criminal and civil penalties for sparking the blaze, which has now burned more than 43,000 acres near Carmel, Big Sur and the Pebble Beach golf resort. Authorities said hikers who reported the fire had to first climb up to a ridge top to get mobile phone reception.\n\n“We understand the devastation and hardship this incident has caused,” CALFIRE Battalion Chief Jonathan Cox said. “We appeal for anyone who was in the area of origin to please come forward and give any information they have, no matter how inconsequential they may believe it to be. It could be instrumental in this investigation.”\n\nThe campfire was started about two miles from the main road, in an area closed to camping, state parks officials said.\n\nHigh temperatures have complicated the battle against the fire, which is sending a massive plume of smoke into the sky about 120 miles south of San Francisco. The fire is burning in steep, rugged coastal terrain.\n\nThe fire is a top national priority: 510 fire engines, 51 water tankers, 72 bulldozers, 17 helicopters, six air tankers, and more than 5,400 firefighters are battling the blaze, which is about 18% contained. Carmel-area residents have posted pictures on social media showing the ash dusting surfaces and the smoke clouding the sky.\n\nCalif. Gov. Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency to free up resources for firefighting efforts, and several neighborhoods remain evacuated. Homes in the area are spread amongst the hills, linked by narrow roads winding through the tree-and-brush-covered landscape parched by the state’s ongoing drought. Due to the drought and fire risk, campfires outside of campgrounds are barred in large sections of California.\n\n“Even though it may be a comfort, it’s not worth the risk of having a campfire and the unintended consequences,” said Don Jaques, a U.S. Forest Service fire spokesman. “The risk that’s out there is just too great.”\n\nCalifornia is a tinderbox of dead trees, which is fueling the fire risk. A new federal report says 26 million trees have died in the southern Sierra Nevada since October 2015, and those deaths are in addition to the 40 million trees that died across the state from 2010 to October 2015, bringing the total to at least 66 million dead trees. Four straight years of severe drought in California, a dramatic rise in bark beetle infestation and warmer temperatures are leading to historic levels of tree die-off, according to the report.\n\nFirefighters said about 300 new wildfires were sparked last week in California, with virtually all of them quickly contained. Large portions of California are considered at “above normal” for wildfire risk, as is northern Nevada, northwestern Utah, southeastern Oregon, and southern Idaho and Montana, according to the National Interagency Fire Center’s Aug. 1 prediction.\n\nAnyone with information about the Soberanes Fire is asked to call: 1-800-468-4408.', 'title': 'Illegal campfire sparked huge Big Sur-area wildfire', 'url': 'https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/08/02/illegal-campfire-sparked-huge-big-sur-area-wildfire/87978320/', 'keywords': ['illegal', 'wildfire', 'huge', 'state', 'surarea', 'sparked', 'risk', 'campfire', 'trees', 'million', 'area', 'drought', 'california', 'big'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Illegal campfire sparked huge Big Sur-area wildfireA devastating coastal California wildfire that’s destroyed 57 homes and caused the death of a bulldozer driver was sparked by an illegal campfire, authorities said Tuesday as they asked for help finding the culprit.\nAuthorities said hikers who reported the fire had to first climb up to a ridge top to get mobile phone reception.\nDue to the drought and fire risk, campfires outside of campgrounds are barred in large sections of California.\nFirefighters said about 300 new wildfires were sparked last week in California, with virtually all of them quickly contained.\nLarge portions of California are considered at “above normal” for wildfire risk, as is northern Nevada, northwestern Utah, southeastern Oregon, and southern Idaho and Montana, according to the National Interagency Fire Center’s Aug. 1 prediction.', 'date': 1470096000}, {'text': 'Story highlights Blaze has scorched about 3,460 acres since Friday\n\nCause of the Little Valley Fire is under investigation\n\n(CNN) More than 1,000 firefighters are battling to contain a wildfire in western Nevada that has burned about 3,400 acres since Friday and remains 20% contained.\n\nThe Little Valley Fire near Lake Tahoe has destroyed 22 homes and more than a dozen outbuildings, local officials said.\n\nCNN Map\n\nFirefighters struggled with the blaze that began Friday morning as later that night, wind gusts hit up to 87 mph.

A fire engine also suffered significant damage.\n\nCharles Moore, Truckee Meadows’ fire protection district chief, said the cause of the blaze was under investigation. But he said it started in an area where a controlled burn was conducted earlier this week.\n\nThe powerful winds fanning the flames reached gusts in excess of 100 mph over the top of the Sierra early Friday. Nearly 10,000 residents were without power at one point. NV Energy said it was restored to all but about 1,000 by 7pm.\n\nMoore said emergency dispatchers received a report of “a glow” in hills west of Washoe Valley at 1.38 am. Crews arrived to find about five acres burning. But he said it “grew rapidly and quickly spread to 50 acres” in the winds gusting in excess of 70mph at the time.\n\n“It was surreal to wake up to a mountain that was on fire,” resident Kevin Elvrum told KTVN-TV.\n\nMore than 100 homes and ranches are scattered throughout the rural valley bordering Washoe Lake. The ones that have burned are along the forested edge of the valley where it meets the eastern front of the Sierra just west of the lake.\n\nOne belonged to Dennis Hof, who owns the Moonlite Bunny Ranch brothel east of Carson City. He’s running for the state assembly as a Libertarian in the November election.\n\nHof told the Reno Gazette-Journal he wasn’t there at the time but neighbors phoned to tell him his house was burning in the forest south of Reno. He posted photos of it reduced to rubble on his Twitter account Friday afternoon.\n\nKukulus was hopeful the winds would subside enough early Saturday to allow for the use of some helicopters or air tankers.\n\n“We have lots of air ordered up, but yet to put any up because of the wind,” Kukulus said. “They are ready at a moment’s notice.”\n\nEvacuation centers were set up in Reno and Carson City for displaced residents as well as pets and livestock.\n\nThe governor issued an emergency declaration shortly after he left a special session of the legislature in Carson City around noon to get a briefing on the situation. The fire delayed the start of the session.\n\nOfficials for the Federal Emergency Management Agency authorized the use of US fire management assistance to cover as much as 75% of the eligible firefighting costs because the threats posed would constitute a major disaster.\n\nThe fire that prompted the evacuation of 500 homes on the south end of Lake Tahoe was estimated to be 25% contained, thanks in part to rain showers from the storm packing the powerful winds. That fire has burned about 200 acres and forced the closure of part of California Highway 89 but fire officials said they were getting the upper hand on the blaze Friday evening.\n\nFirefighters also snuffed out another fire that destroyed at least one structure and had temporarily closed the Mount Rose Highway connecting Reno to Lake Tahoe.', 'title': 'Sierra Nevada wildfires: trio of blazes destroys homes and forces evacuations', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/15/nevada-wildfires-destroys-homes-forces-evacuations', 'keywords': ['reno', 'winds', 'blazes', 'forces', 'carson', 'valley', 'lake', 'wildfires', 'trio', 'evacuations', 'sierra', 'homes', 'destroys', 'washoe', 'area', 'nevada', 'tahoe'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'A trio of wind-whipped wildfires burning along the Sierra Nevada destroyed 22 homes north of Carson City, forced hundreds of evacuations at Lake Tahoe and temporarily closed a major highway connecting Reno to the mountain lake.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A rainbow arches over the Little Valley fire on Friday in Washoe Lake, Nevada.\nMoore said emergency dispatchers received a report of “a glow” in hills west of Washoe Valley at 1.38 am.\nMore than 100 homes and ranches are scattered throughout the rural valley bordering Washoe Lake.\nFirefighters also snuffed out another fire that destroyed at least one structure and had temporarily closed the Mount Rose Highway connecting Reno to Lake Tahoe.', 'date': 1476489600}, {'text': 'LATEST: Brothel owner Dennis Hof says his home was destroyed after the Little Valley Fire.

Image: Nic Coury/AP\n\nThe Soberanes fire is proving exceptionally difficult to fight due to an unfortunate combination of geography — it\'s burning through steep, forested ridges of the Carmel highlands 200km south of San Francisco — and unusual weather patterns. While most fires die down at night, this one seems to charge up as a humid marine air mass pushes drier air uphill.\n\n"A lot of times fires will lay down, and kind of get quiet at night," meteorologist Ryan Waldron told KSBW News. "In this situation, it\'s unique in that the air mass actually tends to get drier at night, which allows the fire to stay active essentially 24 hours a day."\n\nIt\'s been a rough bushfire season for California, which is now in its fifth year of record-breaking drought. The same week that the Soberanes fire broke out, another vicious bushfire erupted near Big Sur, choking Los Angeles with smoke and forcing thousands to evacuate. At nearly 40,000 acres, the Sand Fire is now close to being contained.\n\nA firefighter battles a part of the Sand Fire blaze in Santa Clarita, California on July 24th. Image: Ringo H.W. Chiu/AP\n\nBoth the Soberanes and Sand Fire are emblematic of the so-called "megafires" that have become eerily common in recent years. These are fires that burn hotter, spread more rapidly and are more difficult to predict and contain than the smaller bushfires the United States, Canada and Australia see by the thousands each year. Megafires were virtually unheard of before the 1990s, but thanks to a combination of human encroachment on wildlands and climate change, they\'re now eating up roughly half of the US Forest Service\'s annual resources.\n\nTo get a sense of just how rapidly these blazes can spread, CalFire released this timelapse of the Soberanes fire\'s first week of life:\n\n1 week time lapse of the #SoberanesFire - now larger than the city of San Francisco at 31,386 acres. pic.twitter.com/P9p7bLMel9 — CAL FIRE (@CAL_FIRE) July 29, 2016\n\nThe Soberanes fire remains "very active", and CalFire is issuing regular updates.\n\n[NBC, KSBW, LA Times]', 'title': 'An Enormous California Bushfire Could Quadruple In Size', 'url': 'https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2016/08/an-enormous-california-bushfire-could-quadruple-in-size/', 'keywords': ['quadruple', 'image', 'size', 'soberanes', 'sand', 'acres', 'week', 'night', 'enormous', 'rapidly', 'california', 'san', 'fires', 'bushfire'], 'tags': {'environment', 'soberanes fire', 'megafires', 'natural disasters', 'Latest Deals', 'fire season', 'fires'}, 'summary': 'An out-of-control bushfire ripping through California\'s central coast is expected to get worse before it gets better.\nImage: Nic Coury/APA 30,000 acre bushfire on Friday, the Soberanes fire expanded rapidly this weekend, scorching over 40,000 acres in Monterey County by Monday.\nIt\'s been a rough bushfire season for California, which is now in its fifth year of record-breaking drought.\nA firefighter battles a part of the Sand Fire blaze in Santa Clarita, California on July 24th.\nChiu/APBoth the Soberanes and Sand Fire are emblematic of the so-called "megafires" that have become eerily common in recent years.', 'date': 1470114000}, {'text': 'The cause of the Soberanes Fire, which started July 22, was an abandoned campfire, according to Cal Fire officials.\n\nCal Fire tweet\n\nInvestigators spent over 150 hours examining the scene and investigating witnesses before determining that the cause was an illegal, unattended campfire, Cal Fire Unit Chief Brennan Blue said at a Tuesday afternoon press conference.

And they claim human activity is to blame.\n\nNinety-five percent of Southern California\'s wildfires are caused by humans, Cal Fire, the state\'s firefighting agency, told National Geographic in 2014. While power tools set off more than 20 percent of fires in San Diego County between 2000 and 2010, campfires were a second place initiator, at nearly 10 percent of fires.\n\nSome researchers have contended that humans also contribute to wildfires indirectly, with man-made climate change leading to the hot, dry climates conducive to wildfires. The season for wildfires increased by 19 percent worldwide between 1979 and 2013, according to a Nature Communications study.\n\nToday, hikers are forbidden from setting campfires outside of campgrounds in much of California, due to the increased risk of fire after years of drought. Firefighters told USA Today that about 300 wildfires began last week in California, but almost all of them were quickly contained.\n\nCal Fire Chief Richard Lopez told KSBW the "devastating" wildfire would have been preventable if people followed state park rules, especially in remote areas. Full containment of the fire will probably not be reached until August 31, the agency said.\n\nFirefighters in California\'s Central Valley are continuing to work to contain a different wildfire that has destroyed three homes, saying they have reached 60 percent containment.\n\nBut there is more humans can do to prevent the conditions for fires, which will require government resources to go to proactive rather than just reactive methods.\n\n“We’re not good at doing maintenance, and then really bad things happen,” says Chris Topik, director of the Restoring America’s Forests program for The Nature Conservancy told Time in May. “Last year the wildfire season was terrible, worst in decades.

High temperatures have complicated the battle against the fire, which is sending a massive plume of smoke into the sky about 120 miles south of San Francisco. The fire is burning in steep, rugged coastal terrain near Monterey, Carmel-by-the-Sea and the famed Pebble Beach golf resort.\n\nMany of the homes burned by the Soberanes Fire were at the highest elevations in the area, where temperatures have been highest.\n\n“That beautiful view comes with a price – the fire risk,” said Bennet Milloy, a spokesman for CALFIRE, the statewide fire agency.\n\nThe fire is a top national priority: Nearly 500 fire engines, 46 water tankers, 72 bulldozers, 16 helicopters, 6 air tankers, and more than 5,000 firefighters are battling the blaze, which is about 18% contained. Carmel-area residents have posted pictures on social media showing the ash dusting surfaces and the smoke clouding the sky.\n\nTemperatures in the higher elevations of the fire were expected to reach at least the mid-90s on Monday, although temperatures were expected to moderate as the week continues. Hotter air temperatures cause wildfires to burn more fiercely.\n\nFirefighters on Monday were warned to take extra care as they battled the blaze. After 10 days of work, fire managers worry front-line firefighters are at growing risk for injury caused by exhaustion, even though crews rotate. A privately contracted bulldozer driver was killed last week when his machine rolled over; bulldozers are often used to clear brush and vegetation from around homes, to prevent fires from spreading.\n\nGov.

Homes in the area are spread amongst the hills, linked by narrow roads winding through the tree-and-brush-covered landscape parched by the state’s ongoing drought.\n\nInland about 200 miles northeast, the Goose Fire near Fresno is also causing alarm due to its rapid growth. The fire that started Saturday is now listed at 1,800 acres, with 400 homes threatened and about 500 people evacuated. That fire was listed about 15% contained on Monday at noon local time. Firefighters on Monday were conducting damage assessments after reporting “extreme” fire behavior on Sunday, said fire information officer Kendal Bortisser.\n\n“Some of these areas, they haven’t burned since the 1960s,” he said.\n\nCalifornia is a tinderbox of dead trees, which is fueling the fire risk. A new federal report says 26 million trees have died in the southern Sierra Nevada since October 2015, and those deaths are in addition to the 40 million trees that died across the state from 2010 to October 2015, bringing the total to at least 66 million dead trees. Four straight years of severe drought in California, a dramatic rise in bark beetle infestation and warmer temperatures are leading to historic levels of tree die-off, according to the report.\n\nFirefighters said about 300 new wildfires sparked last week in California, with virtually all of them quickly contained.

But containment of the blaze – a measure of how much of its perimeter has been cleared by fire crews of unburned vegetation – stood at less than 20 percent on Monday.\n\nAs long as crews can keep the fire’s growth somewhat in check, “we should get more containment as we go along,” said Toni Davis, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Forestry andFire Protection (Cal Fire).\n\nShe added that slightly lower temperatures in the forecast should help that effort, even as some of the heaviest fire has crept into areas largely beyond the reach of ground crews.\n\nFlames have already destroyed 57 homes and 11 outbuildings, with at least five other structures damaged, according to the latest tally. Another 2,000 structures were threatened, with an estimated 350 residents displaced by evacuations.\n\nThe fire threat, coming at the height of the region’s summer travel season, has prompted the closure of several popular California campgrounds and recreation areas along the northern end of the Big Sur coastline, including Point Lobos State Natural Reserve and Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park.\n\nOfficials on Sunday ordered evacuations for the Tassajara Zen Mountain Center in Pfeiffer BigSur.\n\nThe blaze took a deadly turn last Tuesday when a bulldozer operator hired by property owners to help battle the flames was killed when his tractor rolled over. It was the second California wildfire-related death in a week.\n\nAnother fire broke out on Saturday in grass and brush about 30 miles (48 km) northeast of Fresno, in central California, and has since charred about 1,800 acres (607 hectares), threatening 400 structures, according to Cal Fire.

They cut fire lines, they lay hose lines and they fight the flames with water pumped from the engines’ 500-gallon tanks.\n\nOne of the strike teams is from Sonoma County, representing fire agencies in five communities: Cloverdale, Forestville, Santa Rosa, Sonoma Valley and Goldridge. They’re camped at the Carmel Valley base camp on the former Rancho Cañada Golf Course.\n\nThe five trucks are among 546 fire engines battling the obstinate Soberanes Fire, which has burned 40,618 acres in 10 days, and is just 18 percent contained. On Sunday afternoon the strike team had just come off a 24-hour shift, working in the Rancho San Carlos area.\n\nThe crews were tired, but some of them would be heading home Sunday night, after being relieved by fresh firefighters. The rest of the men would have 24 hours of rest before hitting the fire again.\n\n“We laid hose on the ground, we hiked a lot and chased some slop-over fires yesterday (Saturday),” said Sean Lacy, a captain with Sonoma Valley Fire and Rescue. “We lay hose in, pump water in for direct fire attack and support other engines,” said Lacy, a 25-year firefighting veteran.\n\nThe Sonoma County strike team was helping fight the fire under a mutual aid agreement with Cal Fire. The minimum crew for an engine is three, Lacy said, but they try always to send four people.\n\n“That extra person really helps out when you’re trying to lay hose down a dozer line,” he said.\n\nConditions coming off the fire in Rancho San Carlos were difficult, Lacy said. “There were portions of the road coming out that was zero visibility between the smoke and the fog. … It was hot out there yesterday (Saturday),” he said. “The wind came up” and that whipped the flames.\n\nThe Sonoma County strike team has been battling the Soberanes Fire for a week. It left at 2 a.m. July 24, drove all night, checked in at the fire base at Toro Regional Park and went out on the fire line that day.\n\nBefore a strike team goes on assignment, its leader gets briefed by fire bosses, obtains the team’s assignment, then confers with the team before hitting the road to relieve other firefighters.\n\nWhen a team gets back to base camp, the first priority is maintaining the engine, said Danny Cook, a Cal Fire public information officer from Riverside. They clean the engine, get it stocked with fuel and water and reload hose. Then they’re ready to roll out at a moment’s notice, if necessary When the truck is ready, the crews can shower, eat and sleep.\n\nThe Carmel Valley base camp opened Saturday, bringing to three the number of base camps. The third one is at Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park. Having three camps means firefighters don’t have to travel so far to the fire and have more time to rest when they return.\n\nThe Soberanes Fire continued to push its way into the steep terrain of Los Padres National Forest and Ventana National Wilderness to the east and southeast Sunday, said Donald Jaques, a U.S. Forestry public information officer from Utah. The Rancho San Carlos area was a priority for firefighters Sunday.\n\nCal Fire has said that, in a worst-case scenario, the fire could grow to 170,000 acres. The date for full containment is estimated to be Aug. 31.\n\nA new evacuation warning was issued Sunday by the Monterey County Sheriff’s Office for portions of the Cachagua and Tassajara communities.\n\nThe order affects all residents south of the intersection of East Carmel Valley Road at San Clemente Drive.

Four people have suffered injuries from smoke inhalation.\n\nRain helped slow the fire, but strong winds were expected to pick up Saturday night and last into the early hours of Sunday.\n\nThe so-called Little Valley fire was first reported shortly after 1:30 a.m. Friday in the mountains between Lake Tahoe and Washoe Valley, about 8 miles north of Carson City. It spread rapidly thanks to winds gusting at more than 70 mph.\n\nThe cause is still under investigation.\n\nResidents on the west side of Washoe Lake from the Bowers exit to the bottom of Franktown Road were under evacuation orders Saturday, and other neighborhoods have been warned they, too, may need to evacuate during the weekend.\n\nThe fire was one of three that broke out along the Sierra Nevada on Friday.\n\nElsewhere, the Emerald Fire, located on the south end of Lake Tahoe near Cascade Lake and Emerald Bay, prompted the evacuation of 500 homes. It was estimated to be 90 percent contained Saturday evening, according to Cal Fire, after having burned about 210 acres and forcing the closure of part of California Highway 89.\n\nHigh winds and heavy rain in the area halted some firefighting efforts overnight and clogged nearby roads with debris.\n\nThe Associated Press and Chronicle staff writer Marissa Lang contributed to this report.\n\nHamed Aleaziz is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

It forced the closures of numerous schools and roads, and triggered widespread power outages.\n\nFederal disaster funds were approved late Friday to help cover firefighting costs in the parched area that has only recently shown signs of recovering from a five-year drought\n\nAbout 500 firefighters were on the scene Friday night at the so-called Little Valley fire, which broke out about 1:30 a.m. in the mountains between Lake Tahoe and Washoe Valley about 8 miles north of Carson City\n\nFire officials reported zero containment, but said crews working in difficult terrain were aided by afternoon rains, and the winds that were gusting in excess of 50 mph died down as the afternoon wore on.\n\n"We\'ve made good progress on the homes we are currently protecting," said Truckee Meadows Fire Battalion Chief Alex Kukulus.\n\nBut "we are not out of the woods," he told reporters. "We have active fire in the whole area and still no real containment."\n\nMore crews were on their way from as far away as the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\n"When we ramp this thing up this evening, we hope to have 1,000 firefighters in the area," Kukulus said Friday afternoon.\n\nIn addition to the homes, 17 outbuildings have burned. A fire engine also suffered significant damage.\n\nTruckee Meadows Fire Protection District Chief Charles Moore said the cause of the blaze was under investigation. But he said it started in an area where a controlled burn was conducted earlier this week.\n\nThe powerful winds fanning the flames reached gusts in excess of 100 mph over the top of the Sierra early Friday. Nearly 10,000 residents were without power at one point. NV Energy said it was restored to all but about 1,000 by 7 p.m.\n\nMoore said emergency dispatchers received a report of "a glow" in hills west of Washoe Valley at 1:38 a.m.\n\nCrews arrived to find about 5 acres burning. But he said it "grew rapidly and quickly spread to 50 acres" in the winds gusting in excess of 70 mph at the time.\n\n"It was surreal to wake up to a mountain that was on fire," resident Kevin Elvrum told KTVN-TV.\n\nMore than 100 homes and ranches are scattered throughout the rural valley bordering Washoe Lake. The ones that have burned are along the forested edge of the valley where it meets the eastern front of the Sierra just west of the lake.\n\nOne belonged to Dennis Hof, who owns the Moonlite Bunny Ranch brothel east of Carson City. He\'s running for the state Assembly as a Libertarian in the November election.\n\nHof told the Reno Gazette-Journal he wasn\'t there at the time but neighbors phoned to tell him his house was burning in the forest south of Reno. He posted photos of it reduced to rubble on his Twitter account Friday afternoon.\n\nKukulus was hopeful the winds would subside enough early Saturday to allow for the use of some helicopters or air tankers.\n\n"We have lots of air ordered up, but yet to put any up because of the wind," Kukulus said. "They are ready at a moment\'s notice."\n\nEvacuation centers were set up in Reno and Carson City for displaced residents as well as pets and livestock.\n\nThe governor issued an emergency declaration shortly after he left a special session of the Legislature in Carson City around noon to get a briefing on the situation. The fire delayed the start of the session.\n\nOfficials for the Federal Emergency Management Agency authorized the use of U.S. fire management assistance to cover as much as 75 percent of the eligible firefighting costs because the threats posed would constitute a major disaster.\n\nThe fire that prompted the evacuation of 500 homes on the south end of Lake Tahoe was estimated to be 25 percent contained, thanks in part to rain showers from the storm packing the powerful winds. That fire has burned about 200 acres and forced the closure of part of California Highway 89 but fire officials said they were getting the upper hand on the blaze Friday evening.\n\nFirefighters also snuffed out another fire that destroyed at least one structure and had temporarily closed the Mount Rose Highway connecting Reno to Lake Tahoe.', 'title': '22 homes destroyed in northern Nevada wildfire', 'url': 'https://www.dcourier.com/news/2016/oct/14/22-homes-destroyed-northern-nevada-wildfire/', 'keywords': ['wildfire', 'reno', 'northern', 'winds', 'destroyed', 'carson', '22', 'valley', 'lake', 'highway', 'sierra', 'homes', 'washoe', 'nevada', 'tahoe'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'RENO, Nev.

Randy Ainsworth works in a field at the Detwiler Fire in Mariposa County. Marin County fire departments have sent 71 firefighters to wildfires burning in other counties. (Courtesy of San Rafael Fire Department)\n\nMarin firefighters are battling wildfires raging across California, with most resources on the front lines of Mariposa County’s destructive Detwiler Fire that on Wednesday had scorched at least 45,000 acres and destroyed eight structures.\n\nMarin County fire Chief Jason Weber said 71 firefighters from Marin agencies were part of five strike teams covering the Detwiler Fire and a Mendocino County fire. Nearly two dozen firefighters were in San Luis Obispo and Monterey counties, covering for responders sent to Mariposa County.\n\nMarin’s crews joined nearly 6,000 firefighters tackling 17 wildfires across the state.\n\n“After a long and devastating drought, the recent wet winter has produced a significant grass crop statewide,” Weber said. “The grass coupled with massive tree mortality is leading to explosive fire growth.”\n\nThe Detwiler Fire, which broke out Sunday near Lake McClure, prompted evacuations and threatened 1,500 structures Wednesday, when it was only 7 percent contained.\n\nSan Rafael fire Chief Christopher Gray said the wildfire was exhibiting unpredictable behavior due to wind and the area’s vegetation and topography.\n\n“The fire goes one way and then goes another way,” he said. “It’s very challenging.”\n\nGray was receiving information on the blaze from one of four San Rafael firefighters on an engine sent to tackle the fire this week.\n\nIn written communications to Gray, San Rafael fire Capt. Randy Ainsworth called the fire “extreme,” as it burned as much as 30,000 acres on Tuesday. He said the Marin County strike team he was serving with had saved several structures.\n\n“We had a house with the deck (three-quarters) involved in fire and I had the crew cut it off the house immediately,” Ainsworth wrote to Gray.\n\nMarin’s deployed crews included 71 firefighters from the county, Novato, San Rafael, Southern Marin, Ross Valley, Kentfield, Mill Valley, Tiburon, Larkspur and Corte Madera fire departments. Thirty responders were from the Marin County Fire Department.\n\nThe county’s crews partnered with Sonoma County agencies to form five strike teams, with each group consisting of five fire engines, 20 firefighters and two battalion chiefs serving as team leaders.\n\nWeber said although Marin’s agencies sent out a lot of resources, there were still enough crews to cover local incidents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We’re about 170 strong during the summer months, so its 30 out of 170 that are gone and others are stepping up to work behind them,” he said of the county fire department.\n\nThe county’s agencies also assist one another, he said. The Southern Marin fire department on Wednesday was sharing resources with the Mill Valley Fire Department. Mill Valley fire Battalion Chief Scott Barnes was overseeing both agencies. Barnes said Mill Valley sent four firefighters and an engine, and Southern Marin sent two firefighters to the Detwiler Fire.\n\nFire officials said Marin firefighters have responded to more fires across the state in recent years. San Rafael’s Gray said firefighters face challenging conditions.\n\n“The vegetation is stressed and you add in the element of increased temperatures we’ve been experiencing, low humidity and wind — it’s a recipe for disaster,” he said.\n\nSimilar conditions were also causing problems for Marin, fire officials said. Weber said the goal is to keep fires from burning more than 10 acres, but Marin has already seen two larger fires, including a fire that burned 40 acres on Mount Tamalpais and another scorching 25 acres near Hicks Valley.\n\nBarnes stressed the significance of clearing defensible space surrounding homes. He said 30 to 100 feet of brush clearance should border structures.\n\n“It’s up to residents to inspect their property and ensure they have good defensible space, that their address is clearly marked and that trees are not touching their homes,” Barnes said.', 'title': 'Marin deploys 71 firefighters to blazes across state', 'url': 'http://www.marinij.com/article/NO/20170719/NEWS/170719789', 'keywords': ['state', 'sent', 'deploys', 'blazes', 'rafael', 'detwiler', 'firefighters', 'county', 'valley', 'agencies', 'acres', '71', 'san', 'marin'], 'tags': {'Education', 'Dick Spotswood', 'About Town', 'Barfly', 'Marin Supervisors', 'SMART Train', 'Jared Goff', 'IJ Forums', 'Religion', 'Open Space'}, 'summary': 'Marin County fire departments have sent 71 firefighters to wildfires burning in other counties.\nMarin County fire Chief Jason Weber said 71 firefighters from Marin agencies were part of five strike teams covering the Detwiler Fire and a Mendocino County fire.\nMarin’s deployed crews included 71 firefighters from the county, Novato, San Rafael, Southern Marin, Ross Valley, Kentfield, Mill Valley, Tiburon, Larkspur and Corte Madera fire departments.\nBarnes said Mill Valley sent four firefighters and an engine, and Southern Marin sent two firefighters to the Detwiler Fire.\nFire officials said Marin firefighters have responded to more fires across the state in recent years.', 'date': 1500422400}, {'text': 'Downtown Sonora was in a haze Wednesday with smoke from the Detwiler Fire in Mariposa County.

The expected date for full containment is Tuesday.\n\n“Firefighters faced high temperatures along with dry and drought stressed chaparral and grass,” Cal Fire stated in Wednesday night’s update. “Steep and inaccessible terrain continue to challenge control lines.”\n\nAs of Wednesday night’s update, the cause of the fire remained under investigation and no injuries had been reported.\n\nTuolumne County residents with special needs or livestock in the areas under evacuation warning were advised to consider leaving and to contact the Sheriff’s Office if they need special assistance.\n\nThose who choose to evacuate were asked to take a northern route to Highway 120.\n\nThe Red Cross has set up an evacuation shelter at the Mother Lode Fairgrounds at 220 Southgate Drive in Sonora that can accommodate animals both large and small. Between 20 to 25 people had checked into the shelter as of about 6 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nSheriff’s spokeswoman Sgt. Andrea Benson stated in an email that the fire had yet to cross over into Tuolumne County as of about 8 p.m. Wednesday.\n\n“These are precautionary measures due to the unpredictability of wildfires,” Benson stated in regards to the evacuation advisory and warnings.\n\nEmily Kilgore, fire prevention specialist and public information officer for Cal Fire’s Tuolumne-Calaveras Unit, said she was informed the fire was “fanning out” to the north, east and south, as opposed to moving one direction.\n\nKilgore and Benson both referred questions about how many miles away the north end of the fire was from the county line to Cal Fire’s Madera-Mariposa-Merced Unit, the lead agency assigned to the blaze.\n\nNo one who could speak on the record answered the two phone numbers listed for media inquiries about the fire throughout Wednesday, and a message left for the unit’s main headquarters went unreturned.\n\nMcLean also said he didn’t know how far away the blaze was from reaching Tuolumne County.\n\nRepresentatives from the Sheriff’s Office,Tuolumne-Calaveras Unit, Tuolumne County Office of Emergency Services, Tuolumne County Fire Department, Board of Supervisors, and Groveland Community Services District, participated in a closed-door briefing Wednesday afternoon about the fire’s potential impacts on Tuolumne County, which lasted over an hour at the Emergency Operations Center on Striker Court.\n\nCal Fire personnel from “as far as Siskiyou County to the Mexican border” were likely to join the effort, McLean said. There were 413 engines, 57 water tenders, 14 helicopters, an unspecified number of air tankers, 56 hand crews, 70 dozers and 3,175 personnel assigned to the fire as of Wednesday night.\n\nThe cost of battling the blaze as of Wednesday afternoon was $3.25 million.\n\nMcLean said the number of hand crews assigned to the fire indicated it was burning on a lot of steep terrain where dozers are unable to reach.\n\nThe fire was reported just before 4 p.m. Sunday in the area of Detwiler Road and Hunters Valley Road, about two miles east of Lake McClure. The fire had burned more than 19,000 acres as of Tuesday evening, but grew by more than 25,000 acres overnight.\n\nOne of the reasons the blaze was moving fast is due to the previous five years of drought combined with heavy fuel that grew from ample rain over winter and has since dried out, according to McLean.\n\nUnlike the 2013 Rim Fire that burned 257,000 acres mostly in areas with dense tree stands, McLean described the terrain in the Detwiler Fire as “carpets of brush.”\n\n“Not a piece of brush here or a plant there, it’s acres and acres of solid brush,” McLean said. “When embers fall into this carpet, it’s 100 percent certain — not 99 percent — that it will start a fire.”\n\nWildfire behavior throughout the state has become significantly more intense over the past several years because of the drought, McLean said.\n\nWhereas fires in the past would often “lay down” at night and give time for personnel and resources to regroup, “This one is burning almost as if it’s in the middle of the day at night,” McLean said.\n\nMcLean said wildfires burned 130,000 acres from Jan. 1 to Sunday when the Detwiler Fire began, compared 30,000 acres over the same period last year.\n\nThe Tuolumne-Calaveras Unit alone has battled three wildfires aside from helping with the Detwiler Fire in the past several days.\n\nOne fire that broke out late Tuesday night and burned a half-acre near Mount Provo Road was contained later that night. Another on Tuesday night burned 19 acres 10 miles east of Oakdale before it was contained, and the Maria Fire that ignited Monday night at Jesus Maria and Music Gulch roads in Mokelumne Hill had burned 117 acres and was 80 percent contained as of 7:15 p.m. Wednesday.\n\n“The results of the drought are here,” McLean said. “This is a prime example of what we’ve been talking about and why not to be complacent.”\n\nMike Anderson, 54, and Ed Anderson, 74, left their home in Coulterville about noon Wednesday after being told the fire was a mile-and-a-half away and they had 20 minutes to leave. They were among the first to arrive at the fairgrounds in Sonora when the evacuation shelter opened about 3 p.m.\n\nThe Andersons said they only had to time to quickly douse some water on their landscaping and get some their most valued possessions, including their two cats — Shadow and Katt — whom they took to the Tuolumne County Humane Society shelter in Jamestown.\n\n“They didn’t like the ride up here,” Ed Anderson said of the cats.\n\n“I had to carry her on my lap,” Mike Anderson said of his cat, Shadow.\n\nMike Anderson said they drove through heavy smoke from Coulterville to Old Priest Grade that reminded him of the smoke from the Rim Fire at its height. Ed Anderson added that the biggest difference was there was more ash falling from the current fire, which he said looked like snow.\n\nThey had gathered their most important documents, including proof of fire insurance, and other belongings the night before when their road was put under evacuation advisory. Mike Anderson said he had cleared brush around their home well over the 100-feet required by state law, so he’s hopeful that they’ll return soon to find it still standing.\n\nBoth men said they had nowhere else to go and would likely stay at the shelter until they are allowed to return home.\n\nDespite the fact that neither knew the status of their house, they both remained in good spirits and were helping to direct other evacuees find parking and where they could take their animals in the fairgrounds livestock area.\n\n“I can’t do anything about it, so I can’t get stressed,” Mike Anderson said. “I won’t say I’m not upset about it, but I won’t dwell on it.”\n\nContact Alex MacLean at amaclean@uniondemocrat.com or (209) 588-4530.\n\n17759151', 'title': 'Thousands flee wildfire in Mariposa; Tuolumne County homes threatened', 'url': 'https://www.uniondemocrat.com/localnews/5458999-151/thousands-flee-wildfire-in-mariposa-tuolumne-county-homes', 'keywords': ['anderson', 'wildfire', 'burned', 'threatened', 'tuolumne', 'detwiler', 'union', 'county', 'acres', 'homes', 'mariposa', 'flee', 'night', 'sonora', 'smoke', 'thousands'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': '(Maggie Beck / Union Democrat) - union democratDowntown Sonora was in a haze Wednesday with smoke from the Detwiler Fire in Mariposa County.\nTuolumne County residents with special needs or livestock in the areas under evacuation warning were advised to consider leaving and to contact the Sheriff’s Office if they need special assistance.\nAndrea Benson stated in an email that the fire had yet to cross over into Tuolumne County as of about 8 p.m. Wednesday.\nMcLean also said he didn’t know how far away the blaze was from reaching Tuolumne County.\nRepresentatives from the Sheriff’s Office,Tuolumne-Calaveras Unit, Tuolumne County Office of Emergency Services, Tuolumne County Fire Department, Board of Supervisors, and Groveland Community Services District, participated in a closed-door briefing Wednesday afternoon about the fire’s potential impacts on Tuolumne County, which lasted over an hour at the Emergency Operations Center on Striker Court.', 'date': 1500502744}, {'text': "The 2,000 residents of a small California town in the foothills flanking Yosemite National Park were ordered to evacuate on Tuesday.\n\nResidents of tiny Mariposa, in the Sierra Nevada mountains southwest of Yosemite, were ordered to flee after flames from the so-called Detwiler Fire jumped over Highway 140.\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency for Mariposa County on Tuesday as the fire was approaching.

The fire closed one of several roads into the park during its busy summer season, and rangers warned visitors with respiratory problems to be mindful of the smoky haze the blaze wafted over the park\'s landmark Half Dome rock face, Gediman said.\n\nAmong park visitors Gediman talked to, "people understand fire is a naturally occurring thing," he said.

Big timber fuel source," Kehmna said.Officials say eight structures have been destroyed.Mariposa Lodge Owner Mia Gloor watched from a distance, hoping some way, somehow it will stop before getting to her family business. "Everybody is scared, you\'d never think something like this would happen in your town," she said.Delmer Humphrey lives along Highway 49, directly across from the raging blaze. Despite there being a mandatory evacuation,he sat outside in his wheelchair and watched the flames. "I feel safe, I\'m right behind the highway patrolman\'s office. They ain\'t going to leave me," he said.Cal Fire said steep terrain and strong winds have been creating challenges for them over the past three days, causing the raging blaze to burn more than 45,000 acres. "We did have a problem earlier today with embers landing and creating spot fires outside of the area we have been concentrating on," Cal Fire Capt. Jerry Fernandez said.As firefighters work around the clock to get it contained, Humphrey said he will wait to see if it inches closer to his home. If it does, he is going to use a flashlight to get first responders\' attention to save him and his dog Serene. "My dog is my scariest part, the fire can have me, but I won\'t give my dog up. She deserves to live on, I\'m at peace with myself. The Lord can take me when he takes me," he said.It is also important to note that there is a hospital and jail nearby.

(Debora Villalon/KTVU) A fire in Lake County Monday afternoon demonstrated how residents are still raw from the devastating fires of the past two years.\n\n"I\'m sure there were hundreds of 911 calls, honestly," CalFire Division Chief Greg Bertelli told KTVU. "When there\'s a smoke column in the sky, everybody\'s concerned and on high alert."\n\nThe Murphy Fire broke out alongside Highway 29 at 2:45 p.m., about three miles south of Lower Lake.\n\nIt grew to 40 acres before crews stopped it.\n\nBut for some people, every fire, no matter the size, brings feelings of fear and vulnerability.\n\n"I know people who lost their homes and some lost two homes," Misty deGroff of Clearlake told KTVU, as she waited out the highway closure at a pizza parlor in Lower Lake.\n\n"I got a text at work, telling me there was a fire at Hofacker and Highway 29, near where my mom lives, and asking me if she was home, and if she was okay," recounted deGroff, her voice still emotional.\n\n"My mom has been evacuated three times in two years," she explained.\n\nLake County residents have witnessed how swiftly a small grass fire can blow up into a firestorm, when conditions are right.\n\nBut the quick CalFire response on the ground, and in the air, kept the fire relatively small, and away from property: 200 homes and ranches, a winery, and horse stable. No evacuations were necessary.\n\n"If there\'s smoke, there\'s panic, and people are looking for information," Lake County Fire Chief William Sapeta told KTVU.\n\nSapeta notes, residents can\'t help but be traumatized, after the Valley fire of 2015 ravaged Middletown, destroying almost 1300 homes, and killing 4 people.\n\nThen came the Clayton fire last August which overran Lower Lake and destroyed almost 200 homes plus several historic buildings downtown.\n\n"2015 and 2016 were devastating to us," declared Chief Sapeta, "the Rocky fire, the Jerusalem, the Valley, the Clayton, so there\'s a lot of post-traumatic stress disorder going on my community."\n\nThe chief estimates county-wide just 1 in 5 fire victims have rebuilt.\n\nOn Quarterhorse Lane in Lower Lake, one house sits like an island amid weed-covered lots.\n\n"I guess a lot of them aren\'t coming back," said homeowner Michele Vignau, pointing to neighboring parcels, abandoned, and some with "for sale" signs on them.\n\n"We just do what we can do what we can do. But it\'s pretty sad to see everything gone, so fast, and scary."\n\nMonday, when fire broke out again, DJ\'s Pizza in Lower Lake turned to Facebook to encourage those who couldn\'t get home, "come inside, wait it out with us, we\'ve been through this before, it will be okay."\n\n"If they need reassurance, or to relax, somewhere to wait not too far outside town, they can come here and see how it goes," explained server Nicholas Carte.\n\nMisty deGroff was grateful for the respite, waiting with her two children.\n\nBut she realizes the summer and fall will likely bring more fires, and dredge up more tears too.\n\n"It\'s always heartbreaking because I see all my friends who lost their homes before," deGroff explained, "and I see the anxiety they go through and the fear, and it\'s hard."', 'title': 'Latest Lake County fire demonstrates how raw residents feel', 'url': 'http://www.ktvu.com/news/latest-lake-county-fire-demonstrates-how-raw-residents-feel', 'keywords': ['theres', 'told', 'raw', 'latest', 'lost', 'feel', 'county', 'lake', 'chief', 'lower', 'residents', 'homes', 'degroff', 'murphy', 'demonstrates'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'Lower Lake Murphy Fire July 17, 2017 Lower Lake Murphy Fire July 17, 2017LOWER LAKE, Calif.

This is not good,” said Charlotte Allen, as she took in the frightening sight of thick smoke passing by the Miner’s Inn, where she worked the front desk and was yet to evacuate. “We always get fires, but never this close.”\n\nFirefighters, aided by about 20 helicopters and planes, were waging a fevered battle to keep the blaze from pushing into the 2,000-person city. Already 29 structures had burned, but another 4,000 homes and businesses remained in the fire’s path, authorities said.\n\n“I’m praying and hopeful they’ll contain it before it gets into town,” said Deb Harwood, who just two weeks ago retired to the foothills from the Bay Area.\n\nHarwood was forced to flee her new mobile home in Mariposa this week and was staying at an evacuation center 45 miles away in Oakhurst. Several who left their homes because of the fire went to Oakhurst after the evacuation center in Mariposa had to be evacuated.\n\nMeanwhile, as far away as Yosemite Valley, lights flickered on and off as the inferno barreled across power lines and roads 30 miles west of the park. Smoke clouded views of popular Half Dome and El Capitan while portions of Highway 49 and Highway 140, a primary route to Yosemite, were shut down. All park sights and services, however, remained open.\n\nThe past few weeks have brought hot, dry weather to the Sierra foothills, often in the triple digits, which has combined with erratic winds in recent days to fuel the Detwiler Fire. The heat is not expected to let up, with temperatures forecast to warm slightly in coming days.\n\nThe blaze, which began Sunday several miles north of Mariposa, is another mark of California’s late but extraordinarily busy peak fire season. While a wet winter left hills and valleys much moister than normal this year, once they dried out, a bumper crop of grass and brush emerged as easy prey for fire, particularly at lower, hotter spots like Mariposa.\n\nAlso, the Mariposa area is ground zero of the state’s tree mortality epidemic. Tens of millions of trees have died because of the recent drought and a bark beetle infestation in the central and southern Sierra, a die-off that authorities fear only intensifies fire.\n\nAbout 186,000 acres have burned across California this year, according to state and federal figures — about 50 percent more than this time last year and nearly double the five-year average. The Detwiler Fire ranks among the biggest so far, and with fire officials estimating just 7 percent containment Wednesday, the potential for growth remains high. The cause remains under investigation.\n\nLate Tuesday, Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in Mariposa County, which will help get more money and manpower to the area. About 2,200 firefighters were battling the blaze Wednesday afternoon, with the foremost goal of halting its southerly push.\n\n“It’s backing slowly down a hill and there are multiple fire engines and strike teams in there to keep the fire from reaching Mariposa itself,” said Jordan Motta, spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. “It’s just all hands on deck right now.”\n\nMotta said the strong show of force by firefighters appeared to have slowed if not stopped the fire’s forward momentum, at least for the time being.\n\nJanet Kirkland, 72, another evacuee, was most concerned about her 20-year-old African gray parrot named Rookie. She had time to pack up her two dogs, but the bird remained at her house, which she was not optimistic about.\n\n“I’ve resigned myself to the fact that I may not have a home to come back to,” she said.\n\nEvan Sernoffsky, Sarah Ravani and Kurtis Alexander are San Francisco Chronicle staff writers.

Its northern head, near Lake McClure outside Coulterville, was causing the greatest stir. More than 3,700 firefighters were battling the blaze, using 462 engines, 82 bulldozers and 13 helicopters.\n\nCharles Trout, 42, a Turlock (Stanislaus County) resident who was visiting the area to try his luck at panning for gold, was scared off when the skies turned dark around the lake.\n\n“They told us the fire was cresting the mountain in 20 minutes,” he said, pointing to a nearby ridge. “We know fire moves fast, so we got out of there.”\n\nResidents of Coulterville, population 200, remained under evacuation, as did thousands to the south.\n\nJohn Cox, 42, who relocated to Mariposa from Merced two years ago to shake the bustle of city life, said fleeing from fire was not what he signed up for. A handful of blazes this summer have already rattled the foothill community, but none like this one.\n\n“I moved here because it was very relaxing for me, but it’s not now,” Cox said.\n\nWith firefighters holding the line on the fire just north of Mariposa, authorities said they may begin letting some residents return to their homes as soon as Thursday night.\n\n“The fire behavior is not nearly as intense as it was in the past few days,” said Pimlott, with Cal Fire. “That gives firefighters a chance to engage in their plan and put containment lines in. We can truly say we are starting to turn the corner on this fire.”\n\nMariposa resident Murryah Martinez, 34, who has been staying at a shelter in Oakhurst, said she was glad to hear that officials were planning to lift some evacuation orders by the weekend, but she’s also nervous.\n\n“Going back home, it’s going to be scary because I don’t know what I\'ll find,” she said. “I’m just overwhelmed and anxious.”\n\nRick Loomis, 49, already knows what he’ll find. He learned that his mobile home west of Mariposa, where he lived with his girlfriend and 15-year-old son, David, was destroyed.\n\n“I just don’t know what to do or where we’re going to go,” Loomis said. “There’s just a lot of important things in my life I don’t have anymore. It just changes everything. I got to start over.”\n\nMariposa, which sits about an hour’s drive west of Yosemite, was settled in 1849 and still retains much of its Wild West charm. Its old saloons, restaurants and inns are a popular tourist destination, especially in the summer as visitors make their way to the national park.\n\nSeveral roads in the region remained closed because of the fire, including sections of Highway 140, a popular route into the park.\n\nWhile smoky skies were reported in Yosemite, all sights and services were open.\n\nChronicle staff writer Peter Fimrite contributed to this report.\n\nEvan Sernoffsky and Kurtis Alexander are San Francisco Chronicle staff writers.

"And a lot of these firefighters have been out for very long hours, doing what they do and we just wanted to let you know that everybody\'s hearts are in the game here." In the community of Planada, 20 minutes to the east, 18-year-old Chrissy Tiner stood outside the Red Cross shelter at Cesar Chavez Middle School with her German Shepherd, Haley. She and her family had to leave their home a few miles outside the town of Mariposa. “As soon as we could see flames we were like, it’s time to go. It’s not like here in Merced where they’re a distance away. Our hills -- you can walk there. They’re like a mile away. So when you can see flames coming over the hill you know they’re close,” Tiner said. Richard Smith, 74, and his mom have slept at the same middle school shelter the past two nights. He said the fire smelled like a big campfire. “But we made it out OK,” Smith said yesterday.\n\nDetwiler Fire Has Evacuees Not Only Worried About Homes, But Their Jobs Play Download\n\nRick Stanfill, who works at a Burger King in the area, voiced his frustration at the Oakhurst community meeting.

As far as I know, we\'re not going to get any lost wages because we\'re not working, because it\'s been shut down. The earliest we\'ve even heard anything about going back in is the 25th. It might even be longer." Stanfill is worried about paying his bills. He says the ordeal has been hard on his two young daughters. "They\'re scared out of their mind," he said. "They\'re worried they\'re going to lose all their toys. We had to leave one of the cats behind. They\'re upset over that. What\'s going to help us? Who\'s going to help us?" KQED\'s Vanessa Rancaño and the Associated Press contributed to this report. Updated 10 p.m. Wednesday The Detwiler Fire has grown to 48,000 acres and remains only 7 percent contained as of late Wednesday, according to the latest updates from Cal Fire authorities Fire officials told a community meeting for evacuees in Oakhurst Wednesday night that the Mariposa County fire has destroyed 29 structures and threatened at least 1,500. That damage estimate could change as more detailed assessments are made. More than 3,000 firefighters are working around the clock on the monster blaze that has forced thousands of evacuations. The governor has declared a state of emergency to help speed aid to the area. Cal Fire officials wouldn\'t speculate about when they believe the fire will be under control and they could not tell the group of evacuees when they can expect to to return home. Earlier in the day, veteran firefighters talked about the tough conditions they faced with this wildfire. "It\'s moving really fast," Cal Fire Capt. Steve Estes said. "I haven\'t personally seen this fire behavior in over 20 years." Estes says this is his 30th fire season with Cal Fire. "We\'re doing 24-hour shifts. We\'re pushing all the time." Cal Fire spokesman Steve Bruno said they\'ve doubled the number of firefighters battling the fire since Tuesday. Bruno says about 5,000 people have been evacuated from the foothill town of Mariposa and surrounding areas. There has been one injury so far -- an inmate firefighter. "Our priority is structure defense in rural residential areas of Mariposa and surrounding communities," Bruno said. He said the conditions this year are ripe for fire: Years of drought and a bark beetle infestation have left a tinderbox of dead trees. And all the rain this year means a lot of grass and brush to burn. "It is a rapidly moving fire. You have mountainous terrain, plentiful amounts of dry grass and brush, and lots of drought-stricken trees, high temperatures and a brisk wind," Bruno said. "The combination of those factors cause any fire to take off."\n\nThe fire grew so much that base camp was moved Tuesday from Mariposa County Fairgrounds to the Merced County Fairgrounds, about 45 minutes from the edge of the fire. The base camp is like a mini city for firefighters. There are mobile showers, a laundry center and mobile sleeping trailers where firefighters sleep in what one guy described as "coffins." As Bruno put it, this is where the firefighters can get anything they need, "from a tube of toothpaste to thousands of feet of hose." There are fire crews from all over California here. Many of them just got put on this fire, having already spent weeks fighting other California wildfires. "I\'ve been on the road since June 25," said Estes of Cal Fire. "I have a girlfriend, and she lived with me through the Soberanes Fire, and she\'s reliving that. I was on that fire for six weeks. It\'s tough for me. My son\'s on a backpacking trip, and I can\'t join him." The Mariposa County Sheriff\'s Office is currently providing evacuation advisories here. Chrissy Tiner, 18, fled with her family Tuesday when they saw flames cresting the nearby hills. She came to a Red Cross shelter set up at a middle school in the town of Planada east of Merced. "As soon as we could see flames we knew it was time to go," she said. "When you can see flames coming over the hill you know they\'re close." She and her family evacuated from their town about 5 miles east of Merced along with the family dogs, goats and most of their chickens. "We went back roads because the fire blocked our escape route," she said. "The sheriff was sounding pretty panicked saying there were no ways out of Mariposa. But from where we live there was an easy way out." Tiner said ashes were falling like snowflakes and she woke up Tuesday with a sore throat. "We were just keeping an eye on the falling ashes. " Hines says they don\'t know yet if their home was hit by fire. She said when they left embers were falling from the sky and one landed in the yard igniting a small brush fire on the family property that her father put out. "For myself, I am dependent on Jesus and I just listen to his voice," she said. "The only way your faith is totally increased is through trials like this."

Original Post by Laurel Wamsley, NPR A wildfire in the foothills near Yosemite National Park has already consumed eight structures -- and is threatening 1,500 more in the tiny town of Mariposa. The town\'s 2,000 residents have been ordered to evacuate, due to the blaze known as the Detwiler Fire, and Gov. Jerry Brown has issued a state of emergency for Mariposa County. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) posted on its website that "firefighters experienced extreme and aggressive fire behavior" on Tuesday. "Firefighters on the ground as well as aircraft are actively working to contain and suppress the fire."\n\nThe Detwiler Fire has burned more than 45,000 acres and is just 7 percent contained, and it threatens "culturally and historically sensitive areas," the agency says. "I haven\'t seen these conditions in a long time. It\'s a wind-driven, slope-driven, fuel-driven fire," Cal Fire\'s Jerry Fernandez told Fresno\'s ABC affiliate. Mariposa is approximately 150 miles east of San Jose.\n\n/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.npr.org%2Fsections%2Fthetwo-way%2F2017%2F07%2F19%2F538090510%2F-extreme-and-aggressive-california-wildfires-force-thousands-to-evacuate About 4,000 people have had to flee their homes due to the fire, the Los Angeles Times reports; temperatures are expected to drop a few degrees on Wednesday, but humidity and winds will likely continue. Cal Fire spokesman Koby Johns says the cause of the fire is unknown, but its speed is due to the region\'s drought being followed by heavy rains. "Lots of tall grasses, lots of bushes, and they essentially provide like a ladder to the trees," Johns told Valley Public Radio\'s Ezra David Romero. "A lot of those trees are dead oak trees, and then you have fire spreading from tree to tree."

(Pictures of the evacuation center have been added to the slideshow, viewable in the image box.)\n\nAs far as the facilities go for use as an animal shelter, Riggs says about 35 to 40 small animals were brought in earlier and there is capacity for more. “They have to be in crates and/or on leashes,” she reminds owners. As far as space for larger animals, it is somewhat limited. If and when the maximum capacity is reached, she says officials will make sure to share that information in advance.\n\nRiggs adds that those needing help with transport of animals should call the Tuolumne County Sheriff’s Office Dispatch, which is working with Animal Control and certified members of Team Elite to coordinate those efforts.
