As a result, officials revised containment downward, from 15 percent to only 10 percent.\n\nOfficials ordered mandatory evacuations for at least 1,000 residents in southern Santa Barbara County, including portions of Carpinteria. Also, evacuation warnings were issued for parts of Montecito and Summerland, two communities known for multimillion-dollar homes and celebrity estates.\n\nOprah Winfrey and actor Rob Lowe are among the famous with homes in the Montecito area. They both tweeted Sunday about the fire approaching the town and offering prayers.\n\nLowe tweeted Sunday morning that he was "packing to evacuate now."\n\nAlso, TMZ reported that Ellen DeGeneres\' new home was under threat. She purchased a home in Carpinteria back in October.\n\nAs of Sunday, fire officials estimated the cost to date of fighting the Thomas fire at approximately $34 million.\n\nCalifornia Gov.

If you are ordered to evacuate, leave immediately,” an alert from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office said. “If at any point you feel threatened, don’t wait for a mandatory order”.\n\nComplicating peoples’ ability to get information about the fires, power and internet outages were widespread.\n\nPower company Southern California Edison estimated that the Thomas Fire had deprived nearly 90,000 customers of power.\n\nStrong winds have helped push fires through dry brush and impeded firefighting efforts.

Less than 24 hours later, the blaze had torn through more than 45,000 acres and destroyed 150 structures, with windy conditions hampering efforts to combat the flames.\n\nWhile not unprecedented, such winds and wildfires are somewhat unusual this time of year, as the wet season has usually kicked in by now, quashing the potential for fires to start and spread, said Eric Boldt, the warning-coordination meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Los Angeles. But dry weather this year left conditions primed for the Thomas fire and other blazes that have broken out in the Los Angeles area.\n\nMuch is uncertain about how phenomena like the Santa Ana winds might change as the climate warms, but overall hotter, drier conditions mean that events like this one will only become more likely when they do blow down from the mountains, experts say. [Wildfires Blaze in Northern California (Photos)]\n\nOf the five fires burning in the Los Angeles area, the Thomas fire in Ventura is by far the biggest, at 65,000 acres as of Wednesday morning, and has triggered the evacuation of 27,000 people. The Rye fire had burned some 7,000 acres and forced the closure of Interstate 5 in Santa Clarita. The Skirball Fire, at 50 acres, forced the closure of part of the 405 Freeway near the Getty Center and was threatening homes in Bel-Air.\n\nThe fires have rapidly ballooned in size, fueled by the fierce Santa Ana winds blowing down from the hills to the east of the city.\n\nThe smoke from the Thomas Fire in Southern California could be seen from space, shown in an image taken from NASA\'s Terra satellite on Dec. 5, 2017. Credit: NASA\n\nThe Santa Ana winds are an example of a phenomenon more generally known as katabatic winds, when air that\'s under high pressure flows downslope. As it does so, it compresses and becomes warmer and drier. In Southern California, this happens when a high-pressure area sits over the Great Basin region; the air wants to flow from that area of high pressure to an area of low pressure usually found offshore, explained Norman Miller, a climatologist at the University of California, Berkeley. As it does so, the air flows through valleys that channel the winds to higher speeds.\n\nDuring this week\'s Santa Ana event, a gust of 78 mph (126 km/h) was recorded at one outpost at an elevation of 4,000 feet (1,200 meters), Boldt said.\n\nThese winds are a common feature of California autumns, and the winds, as well as the hot, dry conditions they usher in, raise the risk of wildfires. The Santa Anas tend to peak in October, Boldt said, when vegetation is also dry after the long summer dry season.\n\nSanta Ana events can happen into the winter, but usually the wet season has kicked in by then, lowering the fire risk. This fall, though, "we\'ve virtually had zero precipitation," Boldt told Live Science.\n\nTemperatures have also been exceptionally warm. "Thanksgiving was 95 degrees [Fahrenheit, or 35 degrees Celsius] here," Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), said. "It\'s effectively summer conditions here, still." Those conditions serve to dry out vegetation even more, vegetation that was abundant thanks to ample rains last winter that fueled rapidly growing plant species, Miller said.\n\nThe fires are the latest in what has already been one of California\'s worst wildfire seasons on record. Blazes in Northern California in October killed at least 43 people and likely caused billions of dollars in damage, according to the reinsurance firm Aon Benfield.\n\nThe effect of a changing climate on California\'s fire risk is a major concern, but it\'s a complex question because of the myriad factors that affect wildfires. [8 Ways Global Warming Is Already Changing the World]\n\nWork Miller has done suggests that the Santa Ana winds could become faster, hotter and drier as overall higher temperatures intensify the high-pressure systems that fuel the winds. But there is still a lot of uncertainty on how the Santa Anas might be affected, said Swain, who could see the plumes of smoke as he spoke from the UCLA campus.\n\nMore certain is that as temperatures rise, both summer and fall in California will be hotter overall, making it more likely that vegetation will be dried out and primed to fuel wildfires, he said.\n\nSo, while we can\'t say for sure whether intense Santa Ana events like this one will be more or less common in the future, "we know that when they occur, they\'re more likely to have an impact like this," Swain said.\n\nOriginal article on Live Science.', 'title': "Here's Why the Ventura Wildfire Is So Explosive", 'url': 'https://www.livescience.com/61118-why-ventura-wildfire-is-so-explosive.html', 'keywords': ['wildfire', 'winds', 'ana', 'angeles', 'explosive', 'vegetation', 'los', 'heres', 'wildfires', 'california', 'ventura', 'santa', 'conditions', 'dry'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'A disastrous combination of tinder-dry vegetation, the strongest Santa Ana winds in a decade and a spark caused a wildfire to explode in Ventura County, California, north of Los Angeles, overnight Monday (Dec. 4).\nThe fires have rapidly ballooned in size, fueled by the fierce Santa Ana winds blowing down from the hills to the east of the city.\nDuring this week\'s Santa Ana event, a gust of 78 mph (126 km/h) was recorded at one outpost at an elevation of 4,000 feet (1,200 meters), Boldt said.\nSanta Ana events can happen into the winter, but usually the wet season has kicked in by then, lowering the fire risk.\n"Thanksgiving was 95 degrees [Fahrenheit, or 35 degrees Celsius] here," Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), said.', 'date': 1512562260}, {'text': 'At least one person has been killed as a result of the wildfire\n\nThousands have been evacuated from their homes in California\n\nMore than 250,000 homes left without power, reports say\n\nWildfire covering more than 50,500 acres in Ventura County, officials said\n\nThe Thomas fire broke out on Monday night\n\nFirefighters stuggling to contain the inferno Bringing you the latest news and live updates as a wildfire rages in Ventura, California, USA.

More than 8,300 firefighters are now working the fire, the largest firefighting effort in California history. Despite the colossal effort, officials estimate full containment of the fire won\'t take place until early January.\n\nThat\'s partly because, given the persistently poor weather conditions, the fire is burning so intensely that it is creating its own weather conditions. Years of drought combined with the lack of recent rainfall have contributed to the fire\'s huge size and wild behavior, forcing firefighters to speak unusually plainly about the risks the blaze poses and take aggressive action to stop it.\n\nDuring a relative lull late last week, knowing this weekend\'s winds were coming, crews began to prepare for the worst. From the Los Angeles Times:\n\nFirefighters had smothered portions of the Santa Barbara hills with hundreds of thousands of gallons of fire retardant in an attempt to keep embers from igniting spot fires, officials said. Some hillsides were intentionally denuded above Montecito, Summerland and Carpinteria, including in Romero and Toro canyons, to limit the potential damage.\n\nAnother expected lull in the winds on Monday and Tuesday will allow a window for further aggressive operations to contain the fire, including the use of "helitorches," which are exactly what they sound like: Helicopter-borne flamethrowers used to light terrain in a controlled manner before the main fire front arrives. These actions alone will be enough to boost the Thomas Fire into the top spot in California\'s history.\n\nOne extreme tactic firefighters have employed is called "fire front following," designed to preserve firefighter safety in urban areas when "the chances of success are impossible."\n\nFire photographer Stuart Palley was embedded with a Cal Fire crew in Toro Canyon last week, and witnessed the result firsthand.\n\n"We were on a hillside, they were doing structure protection, the sun went down, the winds picked up, the fire blew up and they had to bring all the units down from the canyon for safety," Palley says. "As soon as it was safe to go back up they re-entered the fire and saved some of the houses with minutes to spare. Everything was on fire—cars, orchards, trees—but the houses were OK. They only lost one house out of maybe 50 up there. It was incredible to see."', 'title': 'The Thomas Fire Is About to Become the Largest Wildfire in California History', 'url': 'https://psmag.com/environment/thomas-fire-largest-wildfire-in-california-history', 'keywords': ['wildfire', 'including', 'largest', 'thomas', 'weather', 'winds', 'watching', 'thanks', 'montecito', 'week', 'visit', 'california', 'history'], 'tags': {'THomas Fire', 'Cedar Fire', 'Wildfires', 'Natural Disasters', 'Southern California', 'California'}, 'summary': "Fire rages across a Romero Canyon hillside in Montecito, California, on December 12th, 2017.\n(Photo: Frederic J.

Wildfires have ravaged vast parts of the state this year, with blazes burning from southern California all the way up to wine-growing regions hundreds of miles to the north.

And when the Santa Ana winds blow embers ahead of the fire front, they’ll ignite spot fires, but only if they land on dead vegetation.”\n\nFire officials said that the blaze is contained enough that any further spread will be the result of deliberate actions by firefighters, not uncontrolled expansion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The main fire itself will not have any growth,” the California City Fire Department’s Captain Brandon Vaccaro told the Times. “Any growth that we see or is reflected in the acreage will be based on the control burns.”\n\n\n\n[CNN]', 'title': "California's Thomas Fire Is Now the Largest Wildfire in Official State History", 'url': 'https://gizmodo.com/californias-thomas-fire-is-now-the-largest-wildfire-in-1821556464', 'keywords': ['wildfire', 'state', 'told', 'southern', 'largest', 'official', 'thomas', 'spread', 'extreme', 'vegetation', 'wildfires', 'times', 'dead', 'santa', 'californias', 'history'], 'tags': {'wildfires', 'Filed to: wildfires', 'climate', 'disasters', 'california', 'climate change', 'Science', 'science'}, 'summary': 'Southern California’s Thomas fire is now officially the largest in modern state history, Cal Fire announced late Friday night, after surpassing the 273,000-plus acre Cedar fire from 2003.\nIt also said it expects fire crews to be working on the blaze 24/7 until at least January 7th.\nAs the L.A.

Containment lines already carved around populated areas “held really well,” he said.\n\nMore than 1,000 homes and other structures were destroyed and well over 100,000 people were forced to flee their dwellings at the height of the fire storm, but abandoned communities were gradually reopened to residents this week.\n\nOn Thursday, authorities canceled the last evacuation notices still in effect for Santa Barbara and Ventura counties.\n\nOnly one fatality directly related to the fire has been reported, a firefighter who succumbed to burns and smoke inhalation in the line of duty last Thursday.\n\nAs the fire threat waned, the number of personnel assigned to fight the blaze has been scaled back to about 4,700, down from 8,500 at the fire’s peak.\n\nIn terms of burned landscape, the Thomas fire ranks a close second to California’s largest wildfire on record, the 2003 Cedar blaze in San Diego County, which consumed 273,246 acres (110,579 hectares) and killed 15 people.\n\nThe Thomas fire erupted Dec. 4 and was fanned by hot, dry Santa Ana winds blowing with rare hurricane force from the eastern deserts, spreading flames across miles of Southern California’s rugged, drought-parched coastal terrain.\n\nForecasts called for a return of mild Santa Ana gusts late on Thursday, “but it shouldn’t be anything that really challenges us,” Vaccaro said.\n\nThe California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection has estimated the cost of fighting the blaze at more than $167 million.

More than 970 homes and buildings have been destroyed, and an additional 18,000 structures remain threatened.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching!

"When the wind starts pushing it, we can throw everything we have at it and it\'s not going to do any good," said Mark Brown, an operations section chief for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nThe long-duration Santa Ana wind event will continue at least through Sunday, and weather models continue to show absolutely no rainfall until December 30th at the earliest—as far out as long-range forecasts go. Temperatures are likely to remain in the 80s—record highs that are 10 to 15 degrees warmer than normal for this time of year—with relative humidities in the single digits for much of the rest of the month. These are remarkably unusual conditions for what is typically the beginning of the wettest time of the year.\n\nIt\'s been more than 250 days since it rained in Southern California. This combination of extremely dry conditions, warm temperatures, strong winds, and continued lack of rain has produced an unprecedented potential for rapid fire growth in the middle of the rainy season.\n\nThat the Thomas Fire exists at all right now has stunned Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California–Los Angeles. "It really is incredible this is happening in December," he recently wrote on Twitter.\n\nIn an interview with Pacific Standard, Swain says that, given the unusual weather conditions, the Thomas Fire "has the potential to become the largest fire in California history." That spot is currently held by 2003\'s Cedar Fire in San Diego, which burned more than 2,800 homes and buildings and grew to more than 270,000 acres.\n\nSwain\'s own research has linked human-caused climate change to an increased intensity and likelihood of unusually persistent warm winters along the West Coast. New research released this month by a different group of experts found a previously undescribed connection between melting Arctic sea ice and persistent wintertime drought in California. The combination of these effects amounts to an atmospheric chain reaction that could already be making fire seasons linger later in the year—exactly what seems to be happening now.\n\nSwain notes that the region around the Thomas Fire has seen its warmest and second-driest start to the rainy season on record. "Fires will continue to burn very intensely in Southern California until the rains finally arrive," he says.\n\nIn a worst-case scenario, the Thomas Fire could grow much larger than the Cedar Fire, and ultimately reshape the landscape of the vast Los Padres National Forest spanning hundreds of thousands of acres.\n\n"Much of this area contains tinder-dry mixed chaparral and forest," Swain says, "a pretty explosive mixture under current weather conditions."', 'title': 'The Thomas Fire Could Become the Largest Wildfire in California History', 'url': 'https://psmag.com/environment/thomas-fire-could-become-largest-in-california-history', 'keywords': ['wildfire', 'largest', 'thomas', 'weather', 'winds', 'watching', 'thanks', 'visit', 'swain', 'california', 'santa', 'history', 'conditions'], 'tags': {'Cedar Fire', 'THomas Fire', 'Daniel Swain', 'Climate', 'Forest Fires', 'December megafire', 'California'}, 'summary': 'The Thomas Fire approaches a home on December 12th, 2017, in Montecito, California.\nNow in its 10th day, the massive Thomas Fire in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties has swelled to more than 240,000 acres—eight times the size of San Francisco—one of the worst fires in California history.\nThat the Thomas Fire exists at all right now has stunned Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California–Los Angeles.\nIn an interview with Pacific Standard, Swain says that, given the unusual weather conditions, the Thomas Fire "has the potential to become the largest fire in California history."\n"Much of this area contains tinder-dry mixed chaparral and forest," Swain says, "a pretty explosive mixture under current weather conditions."', 'date': 1513275631}, {'text': '(CNN) As firefighters continue to battle the Thomas Fire in Southern California, one family is mourning the loss of their own.\n\nA procession was held on Highway 126 in Fillmore on Thursday afternoon to honor Cory David Iverson, a 32-year-old firefighter who lost his life battling the Thomas Fire, the largest of the blazes.\n\nIverson, who had been a firefighter with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection -- also known as Cal Fire -- since 2009, was a fire apparatus engineer from San Diego, according to a Cal Fire spokeswoman.\n\nCal Fire engineer Cory Iverson died while fighting the Thomas Fire in Ventura County. He leaves behind his pregnant wife, Ashley, and toddler daughter Evie.\n\nHe drove a fire engine and was killed on the east flank of the Thomas Fire, Lynne Tolmachoff said.

A full list of evacuations and road closures can be found on the County of Santa Barbara and Ventura County websites.\n\nOne other death has been connected to the Thomas Fire: a woman who was killed in a car crash while evacuating last week.

On Tuesday evening, eight days after the Thomas began, there is at last a map in which residents can type in their addresses and find out how close the fire is from their homes. This is thanks to Santa Barbara Fire Chief Pat McElroy, who realized such information was needed. Working through the unified command, the map was designed and launched within 24 hours. It’s tough convincing people to leave their homes when it is still safe \u200b— \u200bbefore they see the actual flames pouring into their backyards. But by then, of course, it is too late. McElroy hopes this will help persuade them to believe the mandatory evacuation order when it comes.\n\nWith a fire like the Thomas, time is of the essence. It has already leapt across Highway 33, destroyed hundreds of homes in Ventura, jumped over Highway 150, and even \u200b— \u200ba few times \u200b— \u200breached across the 101 freeway, incinerating, among other things, the lush palm-tree nursery on the Pacific side. On Tuesday night, when the Santa Ana winds had died down a bit, Incident Command was confronting whether they would be able to stop those same winds from pushing the Thomas Fire downslope past Highway 192. That’s the heart of Montecito and the pathway to the City of Santa Barbara. It’s where most of the people are.\n\nFire crews amass along Highway 150 and Bates Road just east of Carpinteria as the air attack continues.

But what had never happened before is a continual blast of Santa Ana winds blowing day after day after day. “We used to be able to say with some certainty, ‘Fires will do this.’ Or ‘Fires will do that,” said Chief McElroy. “That’s not true anymore. That’s what’s scaring people.”\n\nThe Thomas Fire has been designated the top priority among all fires in the country. Accordingly, a massive army of firefighters has assembled: more than 8,000 personnel, 28 helicopters, six fixed-wing air tankers, a DC-10, and a 747 dropping millions of gallons of water and retardant. There are trucks, engines, and crew from just about every state and every county. It’s like a United Nations convention of firefighters. A small city of Oregon where it rains 250 inches a year sent its only engine, looking very much like a converted pickup truck with a hose attached. The Morongo Mission tribe sent a crew of hot shots.

Soot and ash from the flames led to record-high air pollution in the region, making it too dangerous to even be outside.\n\nIt’s a tragic finale to what has already been California’s worst fire season, as several huge, deadly infernos burned uncontrolled for days across the state.\n\nThe Tubbs Fire, which ignited in October in Sonoma County, torched 5,643 structures, making it the most destructive wildfire on record in California, and killed 22 people. Across the state, fires killed more than 40 people and scorched more than 1.2 million acres, towering over the five-year average of 202,751 acres.\n\nWhat caused California’s “perfect firestorm”\n\nSeveral natural and human-caused factors have converged this year to add to the devastation. Following years of drought, the wettest winter on record drenched the state, feeding a bumper crop of trees, grasses, and shrubs throughout California. Then heat waves baked much of the state, drying out the vegetation, followed by unusually stiff seasonal winds.\n\nAt the same time, populations are growing throughout California, especially close to fire-prone areas. Human activities ignite the vast majority of wildfires, and climate change is worsening forest fires throughout the United States, though researchers don’t see a connection between climate change and the current brush fires around Los Angeles.\n\nAs a result, fires have become more dangerous, and more destructive blazes are in store for the Golden State. As you can see in this chart, 14 of the top 20 largest fires in California history have occurred since 2000.\n\nUniversity of California Los Angeles environmental scientist Glen MacDonald called it a “perfect firestorm.” He added: “It really shows you our relative power to nature. We sometimes overestimate how much we can handle.”\n\nFor now, fire officials are optimistic that the devastating fire season is finally coming to a close.\n\nScott McLean, deputy chief at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire), said it will likely still be a few weeks before the Thomas Fire is fully contained since parts of the fire are in remote and inaccessible areas.\n\nBut the swift Santa Ana winds are dying down and humidity is rising in the region, reducing the risk of a new inferno. The dry start to the year may also mean there will be less vegetation to burn in this year’s fire season.\n\nHowever, it’s still too early to tell what 2018 holds, and officials warn that the lingering effects of the current fires are creating new risks. The denuded land in the wake of the flames could now face mudslides as the rainy season picks up, for example.\n\n“We can’t be complacent,” McLean said. “We’re in California.”', 'title': 'Southern California is (still) on fire.

This is larger than the Cedar Fire, which burned 273,246 acres in October 2003 in San Diego, according to CalFire.\n\nWhile this December has been particularly active, the month typically tends to be one of the calmer months in terms of wildfires.\n\nThere have been only eight California wildfires that burned more than 300 acres in December from 2000 to 2015. The second lowest months for large fire activity are January and February, according to CalFire.\n\nIn comparison, there have already been six wildfires that burned more than 300 acres this December.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the eight fires in December from 2000 to 2015, five were in Southern California and two were in Ventura County.\n\nThe total acres burned in those seven fires is 22,835, which is only a fraction of the Thomas Fire burning in Ventura County.\n\nThe previous largest fire in December was the Shekell Fire in Ventura, which burned 13,600 acres in 2006.\n\nWildfires are rare in December due to typical weather patterns in the Golden State. California has a dry season and a rainy season. The wet season typically peaks between December and March.\n\nExtreme wildfires do not usually happen in California during December because it is usually in the wet season, according to AccuWeather Meteorologist Jordan Root.\n\n“Storms usually start to dip farther south across the western United States late in the year, which brings rain and mountain snow to the state,” Root said.\n\nHowever, this year has been different.

From there, a fire is considered controlled when there's no further threat of it burning beyond containment lines.\n\nThe Thomas fire also contributed to a deadly landslide Jan. 9 in the seaside community of Santa Barbara. Hillsides stripped of vegetation by the fire gave way during an early morning downpour, unleashing a mudflow that killed at least 21 people.\n\nClosure orders due to the fire were lifted May 24. Crews are still repairing roads, trails and fences damaged by the fire in Los Padres National Forest, where about 181,000 acres burned.\n\nIn the case of the Thomas fire, firefighters faced an enormous challenge due to strong and shifting winds, especially during the first 24 hours after the fire started in Ventura County. The fire flared up Dec. 10, burning nearly 61,000 acres in about a week.\n\nIt was part of a deadly and destructive year for wildfires in California. More than 40 people were killed and more than 11,000 homes were destroyed by wildfires in 2017. More than 9,000 fires burned 1.2 million acres across the state.\n\nThe significant increase in the numbers and size of fires last year was largely because the state was coming off one of its wettest winters in years in 2016-2017, which left hillsides covered in grass and other vegetation. That grass dried out in summer and turned into tinder, providing fuel for rapidly spreading fires often pushed by strong winds that can carry hot embers for miles and turn small spot fires into infernos.\n\nAn increase in the number of dead and dying trees also has exacerbated the wildfire threat, Cal Fire officials said.", 'title': "Six Months After It Started, California's Largest Fire on Record Is Officially Out", 'url': 'https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Thomas-Fire-Wildfire-Out-Santa-Barbara-California-Ventura-484315941.html', 'keywords': ['wildfire', 'burning', 'largest', 'thomas', 'officially', 'vegetation', 'months', 'acres', 'jan', 'started', 'ventura', 'record', 'californias', 'santa', 'fires'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': "What to Know The 282,000-acre Thomas fire started Dec. 4 in Ventura CountyIt was contained on Jan. 12 after burning in Ventura and Santa Barbara countiesIt is the largest wildfire on record in CaliforniaAfter months of putting out hot spots, the largest fire on record in California was officially declared out on Friday.\nLos Padres National Forest officials said there have not been any hot spots detected in the Thomas fire burn area for more than two months, leading to Friday's declaration.\nThe devastating wildfire started Dec. 4, burning through 281,893 acres in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.\nThe Thomas fire also contributed to a deadly landslide Jan. 9 in the seaside community of Santa Barbara.\nAn increase in the number of dead and dying trees also has exacerbated the wildfire threat, Cal Fire officials said.", 'date': None}, {'text': '(CNN) After more than a month of destruction, the largest fire in California\'s modern history is now 100% contained, according to the US Forest Service.\n\nThe Thomas Fire ignited on December 4 and has burned about 281,900 acres since then, sending wide swaths of Southern California up in flames.

But in most respects, they were also entirely predictable—and predicted.\n\nThe Thomas Fire, the largest wildfire in California history, burned almost 450 square miles of the Santa Ynez mountains in late December, a swath of steep, rocky chaparral as big as San Antonio. Then the rains came, a massive winter storm after almost a year of drought. This is the climatic and geomorphological history of the transverse ranges, the “fire-flood cycle”—as a scientific journal article named it in 1935.\n\nThe mountains of Southern California burn and then liquefy with terrifying regularity, and, yes, more often than they used to thanks in some measure to climate change and increased human development. Only now, science is starting to catch up to the cycle—to understand how it works and predict when it will be at its worst. And those scientific insights are coming just in time for more and more people to build more and more houses at the feet of those eternally liquefying mountains.\n\nIn one sense the mudslides—what geologists more properly call “debris flows,” because they contain both water and a diversity of stuff, from ash to houses—have always been predictable. Wildfires are getting more common, and wildfires make mountainsides more likely to give way. With vegetation burned away, roots that held underlying soil together are gone, and the cover that a canopy might have provided against rain vanishes as well. In Southern California’s chaparral biome, that vegetation adds another factor. Those shrubs and low, waxy plants are adapted to fires every few decades. Their drought tolerance comes in part from a resin-like coat on their leaves that helps retain moisture.\n\nBut fire volatilizes that wax, which then coats the soil and ash left behind. “You develop these hydrophobic soils,” says Francis Rengers, a geomorphologist on the US Geological Survey’s Post-Wildfire Debris Flow Team. “It’s like you put a raincoat on the landscape.” After a fire, rain that would have ordinarily soaked into the ground instead bounces off and runs down the hillside, picking up loose sediment and rocks along the way.1\n\nEven the geology of Southern California’s mostly east-west mountain ranges makes debris flows more likely. The region’s frequent earthquakes—what, you want fires and mudslides to be the only disasters?—are evidence of “active tectonics.” Which is to say, those mountain ranges are growing boys and girls, always getting taller and steeper. More steep equals more likely to slide. The rock itself is, geologically speaking, “shattered”—above Montecito, where the Thomas-related slides were, it’s sedimentary and metasedimentary rock, much more likely to erode than, say, Yosemite granite. “It’s rock that’s loose and available to move,” Rengers says.\n\nSo these SoCal debris flows are, quite literally, the stuff of literature. The great science journalist John McPhee wrote about them in “Los Angeles Against the Mountains” in 1988, and TC Boyle picked up on the terror of it all in his 2005 short story “La Conchita.” “A vanguard of boulders came sluicing across the freeway, followed by a soupy river of mud. A rock the size of a cannonball thumped into the underside of the U-Haul truck and a fistful of pellets—gravel, I guess—sprayed the side of my car,” Boyle writes. “The mud spread out across the pavement, seething around the tires and underneath the car and beyond, and soon dark tongues of it had pushed across the southbound lanes, too.”\n\nIt’s good writing because it’s right. “The debris starts out in a loose state and gets agitated as it goes downhill. As it mixes with water, it attains a liquefied state that allows it to flow almost as readily as water, even though it’s charged with boulders and debris,” says Richard Iverson, a hydrologist with the US Geological Survey. “The leading edge is chock-full of the largest debris, and that part has a lot of resistance. So what you get is a more liquefied, fluid part pushing that resistive front forward, but because you have the front it can become much deeper.”\n\nIn other words, the leading edge of a debris flow is a moving dam, a wave of destruction that accretes yet more ammunition as it oozes forward as fast as 10 miles per hour, like the parade in Satoshi Kon’s Paprika—a “bouldery snout,” as Susan Cannon and Jerry DeGraff wrote in 2009, “followed by a more viscous body that transitions to a very muddy water flow.” The big stuff in the front acts like a bulldozer, the pressure of the muck causes even more damage, and the water can literally float cars off the ground and buildings off their foundations.\n\n“Down a steep canyon, the debris flow will be getting bigger and bigger,” Iverson says. “Once it hits flatter terrain or can spread out onto an alluvial fan or into a neighborhood, then it slows down and quits growing.”\n\nFortunately, in recent years geologists have gotten better and better at predicting which slopes are likely to slide after fires, based on computer models using data from previous flows. So for example, the debris flow team starts with satellite images of burned areas, comparing the green-ness of before images to the blackness of the afters to develop burn severity maps. “That’s called a normalized burn ratio image,” Rengers says. “It’s a quantifiable signal.”\n\nTo that, they add soil erodibility data from onsite examination and the National Resources Conservation Service, the soil division of the US Department of Agriculture, combined with information on the steepness of the slopes that burned. “Areas with high burn severity, steep slopes, and high erodibility have the highest probabilities for where debris flows will originate,” Rengers says.\n\nAnd in fact, the USGS map of debris flow hazards shows the hills above Montecito and Summerland as having a very high probability of sliding. The area was under evacuation orders before Tuesday.\n\nIt just needed one more ingredient: Rain. And that happened, too. “For the Santa Barbara County-Ventura area, it takes about a half an inch of rain in one hour for debris flows to occur,” Rengers says. “What we saw in the Montecito area was that there was a half inch of rain in five minutes.”\n\nSo it was a coincidental catastrophe. Chaparral starts to grow back within months; the rains came just weeks after fire crews got the Thomas Fire under control. I drove through that part of the state two weeks ago, and the hillsides were black. “It was a really low probability rainfall event, like a 0.5 percent chance,” Rengers says. “That kind of explains the big response.”\n\nWhat researchers like Iverson and Rengers don’t yet know how to predict is what kind of damage a debris flow will do and where it’ll go. The flatter land between the mountains and the sea, packed with buildings, is in its way more chaotic terrain than the hillsides and canyons. The question is, how far will a debris flow spread? “Once something comes out of the canyon and gets routed down streets and between houses, it becomes challenging to track the momentum and deceleration of the flow,” Rengers says. “We’re pretty confident we understand the physics, but the parameter values, like how much debris should we estimate? What water ratio? It’s almost impossible.”\n\nIt’s all under active research; people from the USGS debris flow group are in Southern California already, flying planes over the area and taking measurements. Iverson’s group is working on models for the potentially city-killing debris flows that could conceivably come off of Mount Rainier in Washington.\n\nFire researchers and geologists know a few things for sure: The 2018 fire season starts in about nine months. The cycle starts again. And what’s true in California is increasingly true everywhere. Fires are more likely to start in the built environment, along the wildland-urban interface where human beings live, and more human beings live there than ever before. Climate change means warmer springs and summers, and possibly increases in precipitation as well. Then the rains will come, and mountainsides will flow like water again.\n\n1 UPDATE 1/12/18 10:40 AM Shortened the quote for clarity and changed from previous version, which said the water infiltrated despite hydrophobicity.', 'title': 'How a Mudslide Becomes a Deadly Tsunami of Rocks and Sludge', 'url': 'https://www.wired.com/story/post-wildfire-mudslide/', 'keywords': ['water', 'rengers', 'likely', 'flows', 'deadly', 'tsunami', 'rocks', 'debris', 'rain', 'sludge', 'starts', 'flow', 'mudslide', 'california', 'steep'], 'tags': {'#disaster', '#wildfires', '#California', '#climate change'}, 'summary': '“You develop these hydrophobic soils,” says Francis Rengers, a geomorphologist on the US Geological Survey’s Post-Wildfire Debris Flow Team.\nSo these SoCal debris flows are, quite literally, the stuff of literature.\n“The debris starts out in a loose state and gets agitated as it goes downhill.\nAnd in fact, the USGS map of debris flow hazards shows the hills above Montecito and Summerland as having a very high probability of sliding.\nIverson’s group is working on models for the potentially city-killing debris flows that could conceivably come off of Mount Rainier in Washington.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'After battling the so-called "Thomas Fire" for over a month, fire personnel announced on Jan. 12 that the blaze -- the biggest in California\'s history -- is 100 percent contained.\n\nThe wind-whipped wildfire started on Dec. 4 about 60 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles and caused at least 50,000 people to evacuate, destroyed 1,063 structures and scorched roughly 281,893 acres.

"I encourage everyone to heed the advice and orders of local and state officials. THANK YOU to all First Responders for your incredible work!"\n\nOn Jan. 2, Trump declared that a natural disaster exists in California, according to a statement from the White House. He also ordered federal assistance to supplement the on-going recovery efforts in the state.\n\nIn light of the now-contained Thomas Fire, here’s what you need to know about California wildfires.\n\nHow do the fires start?\n\nWhile lightning storms often cause wildfires in Northern California, about 99 percent of wildfires in Southern California are caused by humans, David Peterson, a senior research biologist with the U.S. Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station, told Fox News.\n\nWhile throwing a cigarette butt out of a window is usually not enough to spark a fire, Peterson said, other simple tasks -- like mowing the lawn or parking a car on dry grass -- can.\n\nFor instance, if a rock hits a lawn mower’s metal blades, that’s usually enough friction to create a spark that can ultimately start a fire, Scott McLean, an information officer at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, told Fox News. And the heat from a car’s catalytic converter, a device located underneath that controls its exhaust emissions, can reach up to 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit -- enough heat to create a fire if a car is parked over dry, flammable grass.\n\n“It only takes one spark to start a fire,” McLean said.\n\nAnother common source of wildfires are utility wires, Peterson said. On a windy day, these cables can be knocked over, land on dry vegetation and ultimately ignite a fire.\n\nWildfires are a “perfectly natural, normal phenomenon,” Peterson said. But as urban areas continue to expand into wildland areas, the risk of wildfires will also continue to grow.\n\n“We cannot stop them. We can maybe do things to reduce their severity, like removing as much dead vegetation that we can, but they will continue to occur,” Peterson added.\n\nHow are wildfires stopped?\n\nAll wildfires can bring mass destruction. But the way each fire is stopped varies, McLean said.\n\nIn other words, “the different vegetation and different scenarios up and down the state” impact how each fire is handled.\n\n"You don’t just throw resources at a wildfire,” McLean said. “It’s like a battle -- you have to think what will be the most effective."\n\nCal Fire usually depends on a mix of bulldozers, fire engines, inmate crews, and helicopters or airplanes, which disperse things like fire retardant, to stop wildfires.\n\nUsing containment lines, or large areas where a bulldozer cuts away vegetation to the point where only dirt remains, is very common, he said. But this isn’t always an accessible option.\n\n“‘What would increase the fire’s speed, what would slow it down?\'" McLean asked. “Helicopter and airplanes are ineffective with winds over 30 miles an hour, and bulldozers can’t always get in there.”\n\nStrong wind gusts also cause problems when putting out or controlling wildfires, he said. Regional atmospheric patterns that develop in the fall create dry, hot wind gusts that can sometimes reach 80 miles per hour. These winds can create so-called “spot fires” -- which is when an ember from the central wildfire gets blown into a nearby bush or field, ultimately creating a second fire.\n\n“It’s like a blowtorch,” he said.\n\nIndeed, “the thing that’s really challenging here is the embers, which can float one or two miles and jump across fire breaks,” Peterson said. “That’s why residential areas are so vulnerable.”\n\n"It\'s like a blowtorch." - Scott McLean\n\n“There is so much energy and so much intensity that we cannot stop them with conventional means,” Peterson said. “In these fires, we have to allow them to burn until there’s a period of high humidity and rain that helps reduce the temperature of fire enough to control it.”\n\nBut rain can also create muddy conditions for bulldozers and fire crews which impacts how they can combat the blaze.\n\nPeterson said that firefighters work to “steer” the fire, pushing it toward the ocean, highway or a steep, rocky area where there is less vegetation. This method usually helps to stop or slow down the wildfire. They also use aerial and satellite photos to “work with the landscape” and keep an eye on which direction the wind is coming from, he said.\n\nAs for the Thomas Fire, however, McLean said resident safety always comes first -- hence the evacuations that took place as the fire worsened.\n\n“It’s a case by case basis, and it’s extremely fluid,” McLean said, adding that “several strategies and tactics are in place” to stop or control it.\n\nWhy have California’s wildfires been so destructive recently?\n\nMcLean explained that California had faced a significant drought over the past five years, which created a lot of dead vegetation across the state. Like other Mediterranean climates, wintertime brings rain, which fills up water reserves and helps new plant-life grow. California also had a record amount of rainfall in the spring of 2017. But the summer’s heat dried out that new growth, and, combined with the autumn winds, means “a lot of fuel was created for wildfires,” he said.\n\n“These wildfires in Southern California are unlike anywhere else in the West,” Peterson said. And this year in particular, that’s primarily because of the Santa Ana winds.\n\nIndeed, “the fires that occur in Southern California in the fall and winter are unique,” Peterson said.\n\nWhile most of the wind cycles across the U.S. blow off of the Pacific Ocean and move east, the Santa Ana winds blow off the desert in Arizona and move west toward California. These hot, dry winds, which can reach 50 miles per hour or more, along with warm weather and dead vegetation, is the perfect concoction for severe wildfires.\n\n“This [the Santa Ana winds] usually happens to some extent every year, but, like all natural phenomena, happens more severely some years than others,” he said. One of the more severe years was 2017.\n\nBetween the winds and the lightning storms, close to 10 million acres in the West burned in 2017 alone, Peterson said.\n\nMcLean said there are millions of dead trees in California -- but those primarily serve as potential fuel for wildfires to blaze across the northern part of the state. In Southern California, on the other hand, smaller fuels -- like chaparral, which is a shrub-like plant with fine stems and leaves -- propel the wildfires.\n\n“We’re not dealing much with forest in Southern California, we’re dealing more with chaparral -- and that gets even hotter than a forest fire,” Peterson said.\n\n“There’s a long road ahead of us. The fires we’ve dealt with recently -- like the Thomas Fire -- are all indicators of what we’re having to deal with in California for the next few years,” McLean added.\n\n“Rains are not a cure-all with one winter -- it will take several years of winters to get moisture back into plants and reservoirs.”\n\nWhat is the impact on wine, entertainment and wildlife?\n\nWildfires could also impact the state’s wine industry from an economic standpoint, wine experts previously told Fox News. In the state of California, the wine industry generates $57.6 billion in annual economic activity, according to 2015 data from the Wine Institute.\n\nAbout 325,000 Californians are employed by the wine industry in California, according to the Wine Institute. It also contributes $17.2 billion in wages annually in the state.\n\nAdditionally, the industry generates $7.2 billion in tourism expenditures in California.\n\nOne of the biggest revenue generators in the West are “recreational activities on public lands,” Peterson said -- such as hiking, skiing or sightseeing.\n\n“Businesses shut down, and smaller communities who depend on tourism are greatly impacted,” Peterson said.\n\nAs for wildlife, most animals can either fly or run away from the wildfires, while others can burrow underground. Peterson said that fires are a good thing for deer, elk, Bark Beetles and some types of vegetation. But for other animals -- like the Spotted Owl and the Lynx, for example -- wildfires are harmful, often destroying their habitats.\n\n“There’s always going to be winners and losers in wildfires,” Peterson said.\n\nAdditionally, the smoke from wildfires is hard on people who have respiratory problems. The smoke typically impacts older adults and children.\n\nPeterson recalled a time that there was so much smoke in the air from a wildfire it was difficult to talk.\n\nAs for the entertainment industry, the Hollywood Reporter reported that HBO suspended its second season of “Westworld” due to a 200-acre brush fire that broke out near where the show was filming.\n\nOverall, the Thomas fire has cost more than $204.5 million to fight, a U.S. Forest Service spokesman told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nFox News’ Travis Fedschun and The Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'title': 'Southern California wildfires trigger mass destruction, hurting families, economy', 'url': 'http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/01/12/southern-california-wildfires-trigger-mass-destruction-hurting-families-economy.html', 'keywords': ['southern', 'winds', 'peterson', 'mass', 'economy', 'trigger', 'vegetation', 'families', 'destruction', 'wildfires', 'mclean', 'dec', 'california', 'hurting', 'fires', 'wine'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'One firefighter died while trying to combat the fire in Southern California, authorities said on Dec. 14.\nIn light of the now-contained Thomas Fire, here’s what you need to know about California wildfires.\n“These wildfires in Southern California are unlike anywhere else in the West,” Peterson said.\nIn Southern California, on the other hand, smaller fuels -- like chaparral, which is a shrub-like plant with fine stems and leaves -- propel the wildfires.\n“There’s always going to be winners and losers in wildfires,” Peterson said.', 'date': 1515715200}, {'text': 'A monster of a wildfire burning in Southern California froze the Sawyers’ plans for a big family Christmas and has forced the couple from their Santa Barbara home for nearly two weeks.\n\nThe Sawyers are among thousands of frustrated evacuees who’ve been away from home for days or weeks, living out of hotels or evacuation shelters, or staying with friends or family.\n\nAs of Tuesday, 432 people were still staying at evacuation shelters run by the Red Cross.\n\nThe devastating fire that began on Dec. 4 is responsible for two deaths, has destroyed at least 750 homes and burned about 423 square miles (1,095 square kilometers).\n\n\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Ray and Curry Sawyer’s Christmas tree is up, still waiting for their grandkids to decorate it.

Some have no home to go back to while others are just hoping theirs survive.\n\nThe Sawyers were planning a big family Christmas with their sons, who each are married and have a daughter, and live in Los Angeles and Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nIf their home doesn’t make it, or if a mandatory evacuation remains in place come Christmas, Sawyer said the family will make do in Los Angeles. Her son’s home can accommodate her other son’s family, but Sawyer and her husband would have to stay in a hotel.\n\n“We’ll be more just trying to cramp ourselves into a small space,” she said. “But at least we’ll be together.”\n\nAs of Tuesday, 432 people were still staying at evacuation shelters run by the Red Cross, agency spokeswoman Georgia Duncan said.\n\nThe shelters are preparing to stay open for Christmas and many agencies are donating toys so that the children there have presents to open.\n\nOne company already donated more than 100 bicycles, mostly for children.

The worry is that the ground, having just been singed by flames, will be unable to sop up the excess moisture, directing damaging mudslides toward the very same communities still in recovery from the fire.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website\n\nOn Monday, Meteorologists raised their highest alert for excessive rainfall as a major Pacific storm is set to take aim—coincidentally—on the exact same stretch of coastal real estate that was ravaged in the Thomas Fire, the largest wildfire in state history.\n\nThe Thomas Fire, which is technically still burning, has fundamentally transformed hundreds of square miles in recent weeks, creating a nearly ideal environment for mudslides.\n\n"In some spots, fire burned with such extreme intensity that it incinerated all vegetation and \'cooked\' the soil underneath," University of California–Los Angeles climate scientist Daniel Swain tells Pacific Standard. "It\'s those really high-intensity burn patches, plus those occurring on steep slopes, that will have the greatest potential for debris flows and flash flooding."\n\nThe term "debris flow" seems relatively mild for what is now "a near certainty," in the minds of weather forecasters: Ash, soil, rocks, and charred trees have become untethered to the land, with no grasses or small shrubs to hold them in place. On top of that, add in rainfall in hurricane-like quantity and intensity, and whole hillsides could give way in a swirling torrent of Earth, rushing downhill with a consistency much like wet cement.\n\nIf that description sounds dramatized, consider that, in California, the past few weeks of weather read more like a Hollywood script than real life. Raindrops are falling across Southern California for the first time in more than 300 days. During that period, the driest on record for some locations, the massive Thomas Fire exploded in size during an unrelenting mid-winter period of strong winds. Now, a massive rainstorm arrives, almost perfectly placed to inflict maximum damage.\n\nFloods after fires aren\'t a new phenomenon—in 2016, the residents of Fort McMurray, Canada, faced a similar situation—but this week\'s situation in California is particularly troubling. The physical and psychological cost of piggyback disasters like floods after fires points to the increasingly interconnected effect that climate change and urban development patterns are having on escalating disaster threat worldwide. Drought has killed an unfathomable 129 million trees since 2010 and the recent fires have inflicted perhaps a permanent ecological shift.\n\nThe 2017 wildfire season, the worst in the United States\' history, was three times as costly as the previously most destructive year. Whatever damage occurs this week will be treated as a separate, though linked, disaster. With any luck, there will be a lull that will allow residents, and the rest of us, to consider how to radically rethink our response to reduce the effects of the disasters still to come.', 'title': 'After an Epic Fire, Southern California Is Now Facing an Epic Flood', 'url': 'https://psmag.com/environment/southern-california-is-now-facing-an-epic-flood', 'keywords': ['facing', 'southern', 'wildfire', 'weather', 'weeks', 'watching', 'thomas', 'angeles', 'flood', 'visit', 'epic', 'residents', 'california', 'los'], 'tags': {'Flooding', 'THomas Fire', 'Mudslides', 'Natural Disasters', 'Weather', 'Southern California', 'Thomas Fire'}, 'summary': "A Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy alerts a resident of mandatory evacuations on January 8th, 2018, in the Creek Fire burn area.\n(Photo: Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office)Last month, a huge swath of Southern California was on fire.\nOfficials in Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Los Angeles counties have instituted mandatory evacuations in anticipation of the latest weather calamity in a besieged stretch of the state.\nThe same residents that were, until recently, blanketed with wildfire smoke are now filling sandbags to prepare for a flood.\nLos Angeles, which received less than an inch of rain between March 1st, 2017, and January 1st, 2018, could get three times that in less than a day.", 'date': 1515458214}, {'text': 'Story highlights Hundreds of animals were taken to temporary shelters\n\nHorses were treated for severe burns and smoke inhalation\n\n(CNN) Horse owners scrambled to rescue and evacuate hundreds of animals as wildfires raged across Southern California.\n\nVirginia Padilla said her 7-year-old horse "Ruben" was burned over 65% of his body.\n\n"It\'s awful.

Driven by 50 mph Santa Ana winds—bone-dry katabatic air moving at freeway speeds out of the Mojave desert—the fire transformed overnight from a 5,000-acre burn in a charming chaparral-lined canyon to an inferno the size of Orlando, Florida, that only stopped spreading because it reached the Pacific. Tens of thousands of people evacuated their homes in Ventura; 150 buildings burned and thousands more along the hillside and into downtown are threatened.\n\nThat isn’t the only part of Southern California on fire. The hills above Valencia, where Interstate 5 drops down out of the hills into the city, are burning. Same for a hillside of the San Gabriel Mountains, overlooking the San Fernando Valley. And the same, too, near the Mount Wilson Observatory, and on a hillside overlooking Interstate 405—the flames in view of the Getty Center and destroying homes in the rich-people neighborhoods of Bel-Air and Holmby Hills.\n\nAnd it’s all horribly normal.\n\nSouthern California’s transverse ranges—the mostly east-west mountains that slice up and define the greater Los Angeles region—were fire-prone long before there was a Los Angeles. They’re a broken fragment of tectonic plate, squeezed up out of the ground by the Pacific Plate on one side and the North American on the other, shaped into the San Gabriels, the Santa Monica Mountains, the San Bernardino Mountains. Even the Channel Islands off Ventura’s coast are the tippy-tops of a transverse range.\n\nSanta Anas notwithstanding, the transverse ranges usually keep cool coastal air in and arid desert out. Famously, they’re part of why the great California writer Carey McWilliams called the region “an island on the land.” The hills provided hiding places for cowboy crooks, hiking for the naturalist John Muir, and passes both hidden and mapped for natives and explorers coming from the north and east.\n\nWith the growth and spread of Los Angeles, fire became even more part of Southern California life. “It’s almost textbook. It’s the end of the summer drought, there has not been a lot of rain this year, and we’ve got Santa Ana winds blowing,” says Alexandra Syphard, an ecologist at the Conservation Biology Institute. “Every single year, we have ideal conditions for the types of wildfires we’re experiencing. What we don’t have every single year is an ignition during a wind event. And we’ve had several.”\n\n"The problem is not fire. The problem is people in the wrong places." Alexandra Syphard, Conservation Biology Institute\n\nBefore humans, wildfires happened maybe once or twice a century, long enough for fire-adapted plant species like chapparal to build up a bank of seeds that could come back after a burn. Now, with fires more frequent, native plants can’t keep up. Exotic weeds take root. “A lot of Ventura County has burned way too frequently,” says Jon Keeley, a research ecologist with the US Geological Survey at the Sequoia and Kings Canyon Field Station. “We’ve lost a lot of our natural heritage.”\n\nFires don’t burn like this in Northern California. That’s one of the things that makes the island on the land an island. Most wildfires in the Sierra Nevadas and northern boreal forests are slower, smaller, and more easily put out, relative to the south. (The Napa and Sonoma fires this year were more like southern fires—wind-driven, outside the forests, and near or amid buildings.) Trees buffer the wind and burn less easily than undergrowth. Keeley says northern mountains and forests are “flammability-limited ecosystems,” where fires only get big if the climate allows it—higher temperatures and dryer conditions providing more fuel. Climate change makes fires there more frequent and more severe.\n\nSouthern California, on the other hand, is an “ignition-limited ecosystem.” It’s always a tinderbox. The canyons that cut through the transverse ranges align pretty well with the direction of the Santa Ana winds; they turn into funnels. “Whether or not you get a big fire event depends on whether humans ignite a fire,” he says.\n\nAnd there are just a lot more humans in Southern California these days. In 1969 Ventura County’s population was 369,811. In 2016 it was 849,738—a faster gain than the state as a whole. In 1970 Los Angeles County had 7,032,000 people; in 2015 it was 9,827,000. “If you look historically at Southern California, the frequency of fire has risen along with population growth,” Keeley says. Though even that has a saturation point. The number of fires—though not necessarily their severity—started declining in the 1980s, maybe because of better fire fighting, and maybe because with more people and more buildings and roads and concrete, there’s less to burn.\n\nAs Syphard told me back at the beginning of this year’s fire season, “The problem is not fire. The problem is people in the wrong places.”\n\nLike most fresh-faced young actors in Southern California, the idea of dense development is a relatively recent arrival. Most of the buildings on the island on the land are low, metastasizing in a stellate wave across the landscape, over the flats, up the canyons, and along the hillsides. In 1960 Santa Paula, where the Thomas Fire in Ventura started, was a little town where Santa Paula Canyon hit the Santa Clara River. Today it’s part of greater Ventura, stretching up the canyon, reaching past farms along the river toward Saticoy.\n\nSo the canyons are perfect places for fires. They’re at the Wildland-Urban Interface, developed but not too developed. Wall-to-wall hardscape leaves nothing to burn; no buildings at all means no people to provide an ignition source. But the hills of Ventura or Bel-Air? Firestarty.\n\nAs the transverse ranges defined Southern California before Los Angeles and during its spasmodic growth, today it’s defined by freeways. The mountains shape the roads—I-5 coming over the Grapevine through Tejon Pass in the Tehachapis, the 101 skirting the north side of the Santa Monica Mountains, and the 405 tucking through them via the Sepulveda Pass. The freeways, names spoken as a number with a "the" in front, frame time and space in SoCal. For an Angeleno like me, reports of fires closing the 101, the 210, and the 405 are code for the end of the world. Forget Carey McWilliams; that’s some Nathaniel West stuff right there—the burning of Los Angeles from Day of the Locust, the apocalypse that Hollywood always promises.\n\nIt won’t be the end end, of course. Southern California zoning and development are flirting, for now at least, with density, accommodating more people, dealing with the state’s broad crisis in housing, and incidentally minimizing the size of the wildland interface. No one can unbuild what makes the place an island on the land, but better building on the island might help stop the next fires before they can start.', 'title': 'The Firestorm This Time: Why Los Angeles Is Burning', 'url': 'https://www.wired.com/story/losangeles-wildfire-science/', 'keywords': ['southern', 'burning', 'angeles', 'mountains', 'transverse', 'california', 'firestorm', 'island', 'ventura', 'los', 'santa', 'fires'], 'tags': {'#wildlife', '#urban planning', 'fire', '#climate change'}, 'summary': 'The Thomas Fire spread through the hills above Ventura, in the northern greater Los Angeles megalopolis, with the speed of a hurricane.\nSouthern California’s transverse ranges—the mostly east-west mountains that slice up and define the greater Los Angeles region—were fire-prone long before there was a Los Angeles.\nWith the growth and spread of Los Angeles, fire became even more part of Southern California life.\nAs the transverse ranges defined Southern California before Los Angeles and during its spasmodic growth, today it’s defined by freeways.\nForget Carey McWilliams; that’s some Nathaniel West stuff right there—the burning of Los Angeles from Day of the Locust, the apocalypse that Hollywood always promises.', 'date': None}, {'text': 'Mendocino Complex fire surpasses Thomas Fire as largest wildfire in California\n\nThe Mendocino Complex fires became the largest wildfire incident in recorded California history Monday, less than a year after the Thomas Fire set the record on Dec. 22.\n\nThe Northern California blaze is comprised of two separate, geographically close incidents: the 235,000-acre Ranch Fire east of Ukiah and the 48,800-acre River Fire outside Hopland.

A second fire also was “from an overhead conductor". The two sparked a third, merged, and burned 10 miles, the report said.\n\nA responding firefighter said the smoke was blowing sideways and he had to veer around numerous tree branches to get to the fire.\n\nAnother property owner told Fire Captain Specialist Eric Bettger that he “saw a flash to the east and saw the conductors come down”.\n\n“He said the fire crossed the road within seconds,” Mr Bettger said.\n\nSenator Bill Dodd, a Democrat who represents the Napa area, called the report\'s findings “disappointing and deeply concerning". He has introduced legislation that would require electric utilities to update wildfire plans to determine when they need to cut power to lines during harsh weather and boost infrastructure.\n\nCal Fire investigators are still probing other fires in October and December, including the deadliest blaze in Napa and Sonoma Counties, which PG&E has argued was started by wires belonging to a private homeowner.\n\nAssociated Press', 'title': 'California wildfires that claimed 15 lives sparked by downed power lines, investigators say', 'url': 'https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/california-wildfires-15-dead-downed-powers-lines-investigation-a8391031.html', 'keywords': ['wildfire', 'features', 'thomas', 'burns', 'downed', 'sparked', 'rex', 'investigators', 'firefighters', 'lives', 'say', 'lines', 'wildfires', 'images', 'claimed', 'ventura', 'power', 'afpgetty', 'california'], 'tags': {'wildfires', 'california wildfire', 'iPhone', 'Podcast', 'Kernels Podcast', 'Transfer news', 'California', 'Brexit latest'}, 'summary': 'Falling trees and tree limbs hitting power lines were the most common cause, but one fire erupted after PG&E tried to re-energise a downed line, investigators found.\nPG&E said in a statement the company believed its “overall programmes met our state\'s high standards” for maintaining electrical equipment.\nThe utility said it inspects its two million power poles regularly and prunes about 1.4 million trees a year.\nIn March, PG&E announced it would start switching off power to minimise sparks in vulnerable areas during times of extreme fire danger.\nSenator Bill Dodd, a Democrat who represents the Napa area, called the report\'s findings “disappointing and deeply concerning".', 'date': 1528548744}, {'text': 'The 12 deadly California wildfires last fall were reportedly caused by downed power lines\n\nThe 12 Northern California wildfires last fall...\n\nThe 12 deadly California wildfires last fall were reportedly caused by downed power lines\n\nAssociated Press,California,Wildfire\n\nThe 12 deadly California wildfires last fall were reportedly caused by downed power lines\n\n2018-06-09T01:25:09+02:00\n\n2018-06-09T01:20:42+02:00\n\n2018-06-09T01:25:14+02:00\n\nhttps://static6.businessinsider.de/image/5b1b110a42e1cc61e274aade-500-250/the-12-deadly-california-wildfires-last-fall-were-reportedly-caused-by-downed-power-lines.jpg 500 250\n\nBusinessInsiderDe https://www.businessinsider.de/assets/images/logos/og-image-logo.png\n\nThe 12 Northern California wildfires last fall, including two that killed a total of 15 people, were caused by downed power lines.

Peyton said the treatment was similar to that given to dogs and cats. "The principles of pain management and wound healing are similar across many species," she said.\n\nOne of the bears shortly before she was released back into the wild.

Notice that the fish-scale pattern is still visible on the bear\'s bandaged paw.\n\nA fishy treatment has helped heal two black bears and a mountain lion whose paws were badly scorched in the deadly Thomas Fire, according to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW).\n\nThis past December, the CDFW trapped the three wild animals and treated their burnt paws with a homemade burn salve. Then, veterinarians sutured on an experimental bandage — sterilized tilapia skin — to cover the salve and help the animals\' paws heal, the CDFW reported.\n\nThe treatment worked so well, in fact, that wildlife officials released the two adult black bears (Ursus americanus) and mountain lion (Puma concolor) back into the wild last Thursday (Jan. 18), the CDFW said. [Cuddly But Powerful: See Photos of the World\'s Bears]\n\n"We\'re really hopeful that these novel treatments accelerated the healing for these bears and provided them the best odds of survival," Dr. Deana Clifford, a senior wildlife veterinarian with the CDFW, said in a statement.\n\nThe Thomas Fire lasted more than a month, from Dec. 4, 2017 to Jan. 12, 2018, and burned 440 square miles (1,140 square kilometers), making it California\'s largest wildfire in modern history, according to Cal Fire. The fire was so bad that the CDFW was on the lookout for wild animals that might have been injured in the blaze.\n\nThe first such animal they spotted — an adult female black bear weighing about 200 lbs. (90 kilograms) — gave Dr. Jamie Peyton, chief of integrative medicine at the University of California, Davis\' Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, a chance to try out the experimental treatment.\n\nPeyton isn\'t the first to use tilapia skin on burn victims — doctors in Brazil use the treatment on human burn patients — but she\'s certainly the first doctor to try it on a veterinary patient, the CDFW said. Peyton said she used the bandages because fish skin is high in collagen, a structural protein found in skin.\n\nTilapia bandages aren\'t approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use on human burn victims. But a 2011 study, published in the Journal of Cutaneous and Aesthetic Surgery, showed that collagen dressings had some benefits, even though there was no significant difference in wound healing between 120 burn patients given either a collagen dressing or a conventional dressing.\n\n"Collagen dressing, however, may avoid the need of skin grafting, and provides [the] additional advantage of patients\' compliance and comfort," the researchers wrote in the study.\n\nIn the bear\'s case, Peyton cut pieces of the tilapia skin to fit the bear\'s paws and sutured them over the bear\'s wounds while it was under anesthesia. However, because fish are part of bears\' diets, she covered the tilapia skin with rice paper and corn husks to make it challenging for the bear to tear off and eat the bandages.\n\nThe vets were concerned that the bear would try to chew off the tilapia-skin bandages, so they covered its feet with wrappings made of corn husks. Credit: California Department of Fish and Wildlife\n\n"We expected the outer wrapping to eventually come off, but we hoped the tilapia would keep steady pressure on the wounds and serve as an artificial skin long enough to speed healing of the wounds underneath," Peyton said. She also gave the bear an acupuncture treatment to help it bear the pain.\n\nWithin weeks of capturing the first bear, the CDFW brought in two more animals with burnt paws: a pregnant black bear and a mountain lion. These newcomers also got the salve and tilapia treatment. [Amazing Ecology: Award-Winning Photos of Wildlife]\n\n"This treatment has the potential to be used successfully on all kind[s] of burn patients, both domestic and wild," Clifford said. "By better understanding what resources are needed to care for injured wildlife and what treatment techniques increase healing speed, we can make the most informed treatment decisions, reduce animals\' time in captivity and provide guidance to other facilities caring for burned animals."\n\nThe tilapia skin was sutured onto the mountain lion\'s paw. Credit: California Department of Fish and Wildlife\n\nThe CDFW also acted as the bears\' real estate agents: Given that bears hibernate in the winter, and that these bears hadn\'t had time to make dens, the officials made dens for them by finding prime real estate — that is, a location by their old habitat that was near food and water but that hadn\'t been burned by the fire. Then, the wildlife officials dug into the ground and moved logs to make a cozy winter lodge for each bear.\n\nFinally, it was time to say goodbye. The officials sedated each bear and put them in the dens. But they\'ll be keeping an eye on each one as the bears are fitted with satellite collars and each den has a trail camera by it, the CDFW said.\n\nWildlife officials made this makeshift bear den.

The bears had suffered third-degree burns on their paws, and one of them was so injured it couldn\'t stand. The cougar cub sustained similar second-degree burns.\n\nAlong with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, Jamie Peyton and other UC Davis veterinarians stepped in.

For normal operations, they have to be sedated for safety reasons. But the animals can only go under so many times, and sedating them too frequently can risk their health. ("See How Vets Removed a Melon-Size Tongue From a Rescued Bear")\n\nPutting pain pills in their food isn\'t terribly effective, because there\'s a chance they might not eat them. Vets can\'t wrap the injured paws in cloth bandages either, because if the animals chew on their bandages—which they inevitably do—the cloth can block their intestines. (Related: "First Brain Surgery Performed on Bear")\n\nThat\'s where the fish comes in.\n\nThe vets knew that fish skin has been used in Brazil to treat human burn victims, so Peyton\'s Portuguese-speaking colleague called up a doctor there. Due to restrictions, tilapia bandages can\'t be shipped outside the country, so the U.S. vets had to improvise.\n\nPeyton and her husband visited the local fish market to buy live tilapia. Once they skinned the fish and ate the meat (as to not waste it), they sterilized the skin for several days, modeling the same cold sterilization protocol that\'s used for skin grafts on people.\n\nThen, they returned to the animals. After anesthetizing the bears and cougar and prepping them for surgery, Peyton and her team of veterinarians cut pieces of tilapia skin to fit over the animals\' charred flesh. The amount of fish skin they had to use varied, but generally one bear paw takes about one or two skins.\n\n"It\'s pretty straightforward," Peyton says.\n\nThe wraps are good for about 10 days, but after that they turn leathery. They\'re still functional, but they don\'t have the collagen needed to help repair the skin, so the vets have to switch them out.\n\nWatch: Rescued Bear With Amputated Paws Learns to Walk Again\n\nIn addition to fish bandages, Peyton and the team used acupuncture, chiropractic treatment, and cold-laser therapy on the animals on days they had to be anesthetized for standard care. These techniques are frequently used on other injured animals, but this was the first time Peyton had used fish skins as bandages for large animals. (Watch: "Treating Animals With Acupuncture")\n\nThe treatment seems to be working. The bears, who were released with radio collars on January 17 after one final treatment, are doing well. At that time, about 90 percent of their wounds had healed. (Watch: "Rescued Bear With Amputated Paws Learns to Walk Again")\n\nThe cougar cub is also doing well.\n\n"He acts like a kitten now," Peyton says. "He\'s playing. Just into everything, causing trouble."\n\nShowing Skin\n\nLike human skin, tilapia skin contains certain collagen proteins that are essential for scarring. The fish skin is also resistant—it can withstand more tension than human skin and holds up against moisture. Before use, bandages made in Brazil are sterilized with radiation and, once they\'ve been packaged and refrigerated, can last up to two years.\n\nTilapia bandages, which can be changed a few times over several weeks, are left on until natural scarring takes over. In humans, the fish bandages cut down on healing time and the need for pain medications.\n\nIn the U.S., tens of thousands of donors provide tissue for transplant. About 1.5 million tissue transplants are performed annually to help burn victims, injured athletes, and military members recover. With this number of donations, outfitting humans with tilapia skin bandages is unlikely in the near future, experts say. (Watch: "Brain Surgery Live With Mental Floss")\n\nBut it\'s a good innovation for wildlife, Peyton says.

To treat them, veterinarians bandaged the bears’ paws in tilapia skin. It’s the first time tilapia skin has ever been used on an animal in this way.\n\nWhen the veterinarians with the CDFW Wildlife Investigations Lab first saw the bears, their paw pads had been burned off and the wounds were "oozing," according to a statement by the CDFW. One of them was in so much pain it couldn\'t stand, according to National Geographic.\n\nDr. Jamie Peyton, a veterinarian at the University of California Davis, told Newsweek over email that the Wildlife Investigations Lab treats mostly cats and dogs, plus some livestock and a few odds and ends like reptiles or exotic birds. This was their first time treating bears.\n\nCalifornia Department of Fish and Wildlife\n\n“The first bear that we treated was the inspiration for investigating and using the tilapia skin bandages," Peyton told Newsweek. "She needed something else to provide protection of the wounds, pain relief and accelerated healing."\n\nWhile this was the first time anyone\'s applied tilapia skin to bears, it has been used to treat burns on humans in Brazil, though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration hasn\'t yet approved such usage in the United States. Tilapia skin has especially high concentrations of two key types of collagen proteins, which help damaged skin cells regenerate and can even reduce scarring. The bears were under general anesthesia for the process, so Peyton and her colleagues couldn\'t be sure how they\'d react to their new fish mittens until they woke up.\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\n"The most profound initial response was the bear\'s willingness to stand and move around her enclosure," Peyton wrote. "This demonstrated to us that it was helping her pain and allowing her to use her feet." Payton also applied acupuncture to the bears\' back and limbs, which helps manage pain the same way it can in humans.

The tilapia skin was wrapped in rice paper and corn husks as a precaution, but the skin itself wasn\'t coated with anything to discourage the bears from licking or eating it; it has pain-relieving properties, and the team believes the bears chose to leave the bandages because they recognized how much more comfortable they were with them on.\n\nThe Thomas Fire ripped through Santa Barbara and Ventura counties in December 2017, becoming the largest wildfire ever recorded in the state of California.

If it does rain hard, authorities would use K-rail barriers, sandbags or wooden plank fencing to keep water and debris away, and to divert the flow, said Jim O\'Toussa, a geologist with the Ventura County Public Works Agency.\n\nOther options for gentler slopes are laying down jute, wattles (encased tubes of straw) and silt fencing, he said.\n\n"We can also, depending on site characteristics, use large rocks in a series of check dams -- low mounds of large rock in channels -- to reduce (floodwater) velocity, thereby reducing erosion and storing some eroded material," O\'Toussa said.\n\nThe cruel irony is that the region is suffering from several years of drought, and officials say they need the rain to regrow the plants and trees that can keep the hillsides together and flood-proof.\n\n"We\'re kind of damned if we do and if we don\'t get rain," said Fayram, "because we need the rain, but we don\'t need a serious debris flow problem, either."\n\nTo add more peril, Fayram says the steepness of the Thomas Fire burn area could quickly create high-velocity mud and rock flows.\n\n"In these mountains, we go from 3,000 feet to sea level in sometimes just four or five miles," Fayram said.\n\nThe residents of these communities are well aware that several miles away from the lowest edge of the Thomas Fire line, a chain-reaction flood is possible.\n\n"It\'s just too much to handle after everything that\'s happened," said Pamela Ueckert of Ventura, pushing her child in a stroller on a walk with her mother.\n\nHer home stands, although it reeked of the Thomas Fire\'s gagging calling card -- oppressive smoke.\n\n"I just feel bad for people who lost their homes," Ueckert said.

The blaze began back on Dec. 4 in Ventura County and exploded in growth thanks to strong Santa Ana winds. It has destroyed over 1,000 structures and claimed two lives.\n\nWhile the Thomas Fire became the largest California wildfire in recorded history, it was also the seventh-most destructive, in terms of number of structures destroyed, according to Cal Fire. However, two months prior to the Thomas Fire, a new record was set for most destructive wildfire in state history.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn October, the Tubbs Fire, which charred over 36,000 acres in the state’s wine country, destroyed 5,643 structures and claimed 22 lives in Sonoma and Napa counties. The number of structures destroyed from the Tubbs Fire alone is more than half of the 10,780 total structures lost to wildfire in 2017 statewide. The 22 deaths also make it the third deadliest wildfire on record in California.\n\nAlong with the Tubbs Fire, multiple other destructive blazes damaged critical infrastructure and forced evacuations from Oct. 8 through Oct. 31 across seven counties. Some of the most jarring damage photos came from the city of Santa Rosa, which lost entire sections of neighborhoods.\n\nPresident Donald Trump approved major disaster declarations in October for the Northern California fires and then again on Jan. 2 for the Southern California fires. The disaster declarations will provide federal assistance for recovery efforts in the state.\n\nThe North Bay fires resulted in $9 billion in claimed losses, according to the California Department of Insurance. Across the state, more than 5,700 residential properties were listed as total losses, while over 15,000 residential properties were listed as partial losses.\n\nRELATED:\n\nWhy the devastating California wildfires were so unusual, extreme in December\n\nHow inhaling wildfire smoke can wreak havoc on your health\n\nVIDEO: Are you prepared for a wildfire evacuation?\n\nHow to prepare for wildfires so you can escape safely if a blaze approaches\n\nAccuWeather’s long-range team of meteorologists predicted an above-normal fire season for California, but a season this terrible would’ve been hard to imagine, according to AccuWeather Meteorologist Evan Duffey.\n\nCalifornia’s wetter-than-normal winter in 2016-2017 proved to be a double-edged sword. While frequent storms helped eradicate the state’s five-year drought, the wet weather allowed ample vegetation to grow and subsequently serve as fuel for wildfires in the spring and summer.\n\n“Winter precipitation allows for abundant growth of new vegetation in spring,” Duffey said. “This vegetation, however, rarely makes it to fall without curing due to California\'s hot and dry summers, and so abundant fuels were available for wildfires. Then as fall came around, long-lasting high pressure systems to the east provided the opportunity for offshore wind events which often lead to or worsen fire activity."\n\nCal Fire\'s northern units began summer fire preparations in late May, while the fire season for southern units began in mid-June. While winter preparation is already underway in the northern regions, the southern units have not yet transitioned to winter preparedness.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile October’s fires wreaked havoc in Northern California, Southern California become ensnared in several firestorms in December, an unusual month for such dramatic fire activity.\n\nDecember, which is usually when California’s wet season is beginning, featured persistently dry weather along with frequent Santa Ana wind events which provided the opportunity for several fires to experience explosive growth.\n\nAdditional fires across Southern California in December included the Creek Fire (over 15,600 acres and 60 residences destroyed), Rye Fire (over 6,000 acres and six structures destroyed) and Lilac Fire (4,100 acres and 157 structures destroyed).\n\nOn a national level, the United States Forest Service spent a record $2.4 billion on fire suppression during the fiscal year, which lasted from Oct. 1, 2016, to Sept. 30, 2017. That number is about $800 million more than the approximately $1.6 billion Congress appropriated to the agency. In the previous fiscal year, the forest service spent just over $1.6 billion, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported that Cal Fire spent nearly $700 million fighting fires through early December and the longer fire season has forced state officials to spend more taxpayer money as the firefighting staff expands.\n\nDue to losses in homes, business closures, firefighting and rehabilitation costs and several other factors, AccuWeather predicted in early December that the total cost from the California wildfire season in 2017 will reach $180 billion.\n\nReport a Typo', 'title': "California's 2017 wildfire season to rank among most destructive, costly on record", 'url': 'https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/californias-2017-wildfire-season-to-rank-among-most-destructive-costly-on-record/70003704', 'keywords': ['costly', 'wildfire', 'southern', '2017', 'structures', 'destroyed', 'according', 'rank', 'destructive', 'fires', 'california', 'acres', 'record', 'californias', 'season'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': "California's 2017 wildfire season to rank among most destructive, costly on recordCalifornia’s 2017 wildfire season will go down as one of the worst in the state’s history, thanks to unusual late-season activity and multiple record-shattering blazes.\nWhile the Thomas Fire became the largest California wildfire in recorded history, it was also the seventh-most destructive, in terms of number of structures destroyed, according to Cal Fire.\nThe number of structures destroyed from the Tubbs Fire alone is more than half of the 10,780 total structures lost to wildfire in 2017 statewide.\nPresident Donald Trump approved major disaster declarations in October for the Northern California fires and then again on Jan. 2 for the Southern California fires.\nWhile October’s fires wreaked havoc in Northern California, Southern California become ensnared in several firestorms in December, an unusual month for such dramatic fire activity.", 'date': None}, {'text': "This year will go down as one of the worst in California wildfire history, the latest state fire statistics show.\n\nAs of Dec. 11:\n\nLarge wildfires had destroyed or damaged more than 10,000 structures in California this year, a higher tally than the last nine years combined.\n\nLarge wildfires had killed 43 people – 41 civilians and two firefighters.

Although no lives were lost, six homes in one of the wealthiest communities in the U.S. were incinerated.\n\nSix days later, the Los Angeles Fire Department announced it had determined the cause. “LAFD investigators have determined the fire was caused by an illegal cooking fire at an encampment in a brush area adjacent to where Sepulveda Boulevard crosses under the San Diego (405) Freeway,” the release stated.\n\nThe same day, describing information provided by the L.A. Fire Department, Mayor Eric Garcetti told a local ABC affiliate, “It was a propane burner that somebody had out there in an encampment area near where Sepulveda and the 405 intersect.”\n\nLos Angeles Times reporters traveled to what they believed to be the site, based on directions provided by the fire department. They photographed an encampment in the area and noted that “all that remained Tuesday was a scorched portable stove, a pot, a cheese grater, several fuel canisters and the remnants of a boombox. Burned pages of the Children’s Illustrated Encyclopedia littered the charred brush and rocks in the canyon.”\n\n“We have too many people in the city that live outside, who are homeless, who are in encampments,” the mayor said. “Combined with strong winds it’s what made these fires so quickly become so dangerous.”\n\nAccording to wildfire researchers, one of the biggest factors that makes wildfires dangerous is sprawling urban development. And more recently, research has focused on how wildfires are fueled by climate change, like rising sea levels and increasing temperatures. But unlike a flood or a drought, a wildfire starts with a spark. And even though wildfire researchers argue that identifying who started a particular fire won’t actually describe its cause, as soon as a wildfire spreads, officials begin searching for someone to blame.\n\nIn L.A., the city’s homeless population has been targeted as a fire hazard. But interviews with the LAFD arson unit’s battalion chief indicate that the news release attributing the city’s Skirball fire to a homeless person’s cooking fire contained information considered “preliminary.”\n\n“We are not even close to finishing the investigation, yet,” Mike Castillo told The Intercept, less than a week after the cause was announced. He underlined that an investigation can take six months to a year.\n\nIn contrast to Mayor Garcetti’s description of a propane burner, Castillo said, “At this point in time, with any certainty, I can’t tell you if it was a cooking stove, wood, charcoal briquettes — we just don’t have enough information.”\n\nIn another December conversation, when asked about the L.A. Times story, he said the photographer, “took a picture of a stove in a burned out canyon. If he’d gone one canyon over, there would have been more pictures of stoves burned out.” He said, “If the L.A. Times wants to go out there and take pictures of a bunch of debris and insinuate that’s [where the fire started], I can’t control the L.A. Times or the media.”\n\nWhen Intercept reporters asked a fire department public information officer, Peter Sanders, for the location of the encampment, he shared directions similar to those given to the L.A. Times.\n\nIn a follow-up conversation in January, Castillo stood behind the contents of the press release and the mayor’s “propane burner” remark and stated that he was unsure whether or not the photographed camp site was the one that started the fire but that it was in the correct area. “In all likelihood, it was a homeless encampment area where the fire started, either a cooking or an illegal warming fire,” he said, noting that investigators had found a propane stove that they believe to be the cause.\n\nBut he also reiterated that the potential cause was preliminary and only a “general area of origin” had been determined; there were no suspects or witnesses, and the windy conditions that spread the fire had complicated efforts to find its precise origin.\n\n“There was evidence of multiple cooking sites in that area. Based on the amount of damage, there would be no way to say it was specifically this spot that caused the fire,” Castillo said. “A wind-driven brush fire is very tough to tell the spread of the fire, the direction, because the wind blows in all different directions.”\n\nAsked whether a cause other than a homeless person’s fire was possible, Castillo said, “At this point, we would say no, because we’ve ruled out any other possibilities,” but he added, “That’s not to say we [won’t] interview someone and they say, ‘Oh yeah, I was smoking there, and I threw my cigarette down there right where the stove was.’”\n\nUncertainty aside, city officials sprang to action almost immediately, assembling a task force to survey encampments in fire-prone areas and drawing up plans to clear them.\n\nNickie Miner, vice president of the Bel Air-Beverly Crest Neighborhood Council and community liaison to the city council, says the city’s priority should be “getting them out, clearing out their gear, and keeping them out. I frankly don’t care how they do it, as long as they do it.” She added in an email, “’Asked to leave voluntarily’ is ridiculous. Wishy-washy, useless. That’s the problem, will never happen. They know they can stay, they do stay, and they are not about to leave. That’s why a tougher, constant, consistent stance has to be regularly employed. The homeless population needs to know they cannot set up in OR NEAR the Hills. Period. Bleeding hearts aside, the public safety issue is paramount, first priority.”\n\nNow downtown Los Angeles business owners say Bel Air is getting all the attention, while they, too, have a problem with fires caused by the homeless. And after a relatively small wildfire broke out in Malibu this week, rumors have spread among residents that the homeless are to blame.\n\n“We’re all for folks being safe, housed or unhoused,” said Eric Ares, an organizer with the Los Angeles Community Action Network. But, he said, “There is a history of different law enforcement agencies using these sorts of tragedies and problems as a way of dealing with another problem — homelessness — in a way that doesn’t help the situation, as a pretext to say, Now you’ve got to leave, for your own good.”\n\nAccording to Steve Pyne, a wildfire historian, the rush to point fingers in the wake of a wildfire is typical. “The effort is always to find a rotten apple or two, instead of pointing out that the problem is the barrel,” he said. “We don’t want to deal with the systemic issue that is how we’re living on this particular landscape, which is prone to explosive fires. … You don’t want to stop the economic hub, so you deflect it to other issues.”\n\nIndeed, in a world increasingly altered by climate change and minimally controlled development, the rush in L.A. to blame a population of vulnerable people for a phenomenon that challenges the very way we live on the land may be a sign of what’s to come.\n\n\n\nFirefighters move away from a burning house after discovering downed live power lines, as the Thomas wildfire continues to burn in Carpinteria, Calif., on Dec. 10, 2017. Photo: Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe quick announcement of a cause for the L.A. fire stands in contrast to the hushed tone of fire departments’ investigations into the other massive wildfires that tore through California in 2017.\n\nComing after a long period of drought, last year’s wet winter nurtured an abundance of vegetation, which then dried out again with a summer of record-high temperatures. When seasonal winds picked up in the fall, the landscape turned to kindling. In northern California, six blazes that ignited on October 8 and 9 together burned through more than 200,000 acres, destroying more than 8,400 structures, and killing 44 people, according to Cal Fire.\n\nThe absence of seasonal rains in southern California by December exacerbated the problem. Within three days of the 422-acre Skirball fire’s ignition, four other wildfires broke out in southern California communities, including the Lilac fire, the Creek fire, the Rye fire, and the Thomas fire — which had at least two origin points and became the biggest in California’s history, burning 281,893 acres, destroying more than 1,000 structures, and killing two people. In January, rain poured onto hillsides stripped bare by Thomas, causing mudslides that killed 17 people.\n\nThe causes of the other 10 fires have not been announced. In many of the other cases, residents suspect power lines or other electric utility equipment to be the source of ignition. And even without an official determination of cause, the lawsuits have begun rolling in — including at least three filed by residents accusing Southern California Edison of starting the Thomas fire, and at least 15 suits representing more than 100 people filed against utility giant PG&E in northern California.\n\nCal Fire officials reported that they may never know what caused San Diego’s Lilac fire. “We’ve narrowed it down to a 1-square-foot area where it started, but we didn’t find anything,” Cal Fire San Diego unit Chief Tony Mecham said. “There was nothing there that we could tie to a heat source.”\n\n“The lessons we’ve learned in the past is, to prematurely release a cause before the investigation is over with, somebody down the road, some attorney, is going to call you on it for rushing to judgement,” said Alan Carlson, a private consultant who retired as a deputy chief of Cal Fire in 2010 after working on wildfire investigations for decades. “The consequences of prematurely releasing a cause may cause you to not follow up on everything you should do and then come out with a different variation on how things happened.”\n\nGary White, a longtime wildfire investigator who now works for lawyers, estimated that an investigation into a fire like the Skirball could take weeks or months to complete. His ideal has always been to keep a lid on findings until they’re finalized.\n\n“Frequently, public information officers, they’re trained to push out as much information to the press as they can. It happens sometimes that the [public information officer] knows something about the investigation and releases that information before the investigators want it out there,” said White.\n\nCastillo told The Intercept, inaccurately, that the LAFD’s press release asserted that the cause findings were preliminary. When corrected, he said he thought it was “not at all” problematic that the press release failed to mention the preliminary status and that he felt confident the release was accurate, based on the information they had at the time. “They’re all run past me before they’re published,” he said.\n\nThree veteran wildfire investigators and members of the National Wildfire Coordinating Group’s Wildland Fire Investigation Subcommittee said that wildfires caused by homeless encampments are not unheard of; they also were each able to recall an instance in which a public information officer had prematurely released information about a fire’s origin that turned out to be wrong.\n\nCarlson said, “It wouldn’t be unusual for somebody to mention they believed it to be a homeless encampment cooking fire and then later finding out they really couldn’t prove that.”\n\nA recent example of that kind of error dates back to December 2016, when two teenagers were charged with starting a massive wildfire that killed 14 people as it spread from the Great Smoky Mountains National Park into two Tennessee resort towns. In that case, a hiker with a GoPro camera filmed the teens lighting matches and tossing them on the ground as they traveled the Chimney Tops trail. A headline in the U.K.’s Daily Mail read, “Teens who started Tennessee wildfires could be JAILED FOR LIFE.” Locals demanded the teens be charged as adults.\n\nBut the area happened to be in the midst of a historic drought, and winds that week were wild. Ultimately, it was determined that, although the teens might have been linked to the fire’s ignition in the park, they could not be blamed for its spread to the nearby towns.\n\nWhen charges do stick, they come with penalties. In 2003, first-time deer hunter Sergio Martinez got lost in the woods and was later found dehydrated and delirious. For starting two small signal fires that turned into the second-largest wildfire in California history, Martinez was sent to a halfway house for six months, and forced to pay fines and complete community service. Another California man served two years in prison for starting a 2004 wildfire when his riding lawnmower hit a rock. Fire agencies at the time had warned that mowing could be dangerous.\n\nMore egregiously, last fall, a series of articles published by Breitbart News blamed the northern California fires on an undocumented homeless immigrant, based on no evidence at all. In a news conference, Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordano denied that Jesus Gonzalez had anything to do with the wildfires — he was arrested for starting a small fire, which was quickly extinguished. But the Breitbart article provided an opportunity for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to link sanctuary policies to wildfires. “Once again, a non-cooperative jurisdiction has left their community vulnerable to dangerous individuals and preventable crimes,” ICE Acting Director Thomas Homan said in a statement, adding that the agency had lodged detainers against Gonzalez in the past after four previous arrests and was not notified when Sonoma County released him. “This is especially troubling in light of the massive wildfires already devastating the region. … The residents of Sonoma County, and the state of California, deserve better than policies that expose them to avoidable dangers.”\n\n\n\nPhoto: Jae C. Hong/AP\n\nAsked how important he considers managing homeless encampment cooking fires to be as a tactic of wildfire prevention, Bill Stewart, a wildfire researcher at University of California Berkeley, said, “I don’t think about it. Any type of small outdoor cooking issue is going to be a problem. The homeless encampments are not a huge piece of the problem.” He added that if any tactic should be used, it could be to “get people educated so they don’t try to hide from the police by doing it behind shrubs. Do it on the pavement.”\n\nHe said California’s wildfire problem is more attributable to the housing choices of the rich. “Often, very affluent people like to live in areas high up in the hills of Los Angeles so they can see the ocean and be surrounded by wildlife habitat.” He sees no easy answer for communities that “live in a bed of kindling.”\n\nIn a healthy forest, wildfires would occur periodically, clearing away underbrush that would otherwise act as fuel. Researchers have pointed to controlled burns as a potential tool for preventing sprawling fires, and agencies like Cal Fire have faced criticism for failing to devote sufficient resources to that kind of prevention. But in many areas, allowing fires to burn has become impossible because of the need to protect properties that have increasingly sprawled into previously wild areas. Across California, over the last 30 years, although the number of wildfires annually has decreased, the overall acreage burned has increased — fires have become more intense and harder to put out.\n\nHilly and populated areas like Bel Air present a particular challenge, according to Stewart. Even cutting down the dried-out shrubs and brush that fuel fires risks mudslides and erosion. And he isn’t optimistic about getting people to move out of the line of fire.\n\n“You’ve got to accept that you’re going to have these explosive fires and nothing is going to stop them. You’ve got to shape these communities to accept the character of these fires,” said Pyne. “The war mentality that we’ll overcome force with counterforce is just fallible, and you need to do it, but it’s not getting at the fundamentals.”\n\nClimate change is expected to only exacerbate the conditions that cause wildfires. Attributing a single wildfire or flood to climate change is complex, but scientists have linked California’s drought conditions to increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, and researchers are studying its impact on the winds that fuel the fires. A study from the Pacific Northwest National Labs and Utah State University predicted that both intense flooding and extreme drought could increase in California by 50 percent by the end of the century.\n\n\n\nFlames from the Thomas fire burn in the hills above Carpinteria, Calif., on Dec. 11, 2017.

Fueling the homelessness problem is the same dramatically increasing housing prices that have helped drive people further into previously wild areas. According to the California Housing Partnership Corporation, median rent in L.A. County increased 32 percent between 2000 and 2015, with median income decreasing slightly. The organization has estimated that the county needs 551,807 affordable units in order to meet its lowest-income residents’ needs.\n\nAnd, across the state, the issue of homelessness is only worsened by the fires. An analysis by Zillow for The Guardian indicated that between last September and October, Sonoma County rental prices rose 36 percent, and, in Napa, 23 percent. The city of Santa Rosa, which had already declared a state of emergency the previous year ago due to the homelessness crisis, lost 5 percent of its housing. According to BuzzFeed, some displaced immigrants camped on the beach as they waited for wildfire evacuation orders to be lifted, preferring to sleep outside rather than approach a shelter, where they feared they could be met by immigration enforcement officers.\n\n“There is a clear dynamic that has occurred where, as a result of criminalization and enforcement of laws that are disproportionately enforced against homeless and houseless individuals, residents who are unhoused would rather be in this area where there’s less likelihood of them to being seen,” said Ares. “If the city wasn’t as intense around enforcement, then people would be in areas where they could be served. They can’t be served if they’re not found. They can’t be found if they’re trying to escape being arrested and being cited.”\n\nStill, as the homeless population has increased, some California communities have coped in part by evicting homeless encampments. In Orange County last month, after complaints from neighbors, officials began clearing out an encampment of hundreds on the banks of the Santa Ana River in Anaheim. But the city has nowhere for them to go. There are two homeless people for every free shelter bed in the area.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, the homeless population has increased by 20 percent since 2009, while the number of shelter beds has decreased by 11 percent. But Ares said the problem is gentrification more than a lack of shelter beds. He’s encouraged by successful ballot initiatives that have forced elected officials to put funding into affordable housing and shift away from a tactic of citations, arrests, and encampment evictions. But he says the shift in rhetoric has not meant the end of criminalization. A study by Million Dollar Hoods showed that the annual number of arrests of homeless people in L.A. rose by 37 percent between 2011 and 2016, and continued to creep up in 2017.\n\nAccording to Miner, the Neighborhood Council vice president, the community of Bel Air-Beverly Crest has long been concerned about a particular homeless encampment in a canyon outside the area impacted by the Skirball fire. She said she and others had suspected there were more. “There’s people hiding in these hills. Without seeing anything, you just knew it,” she said, noting that she’s also concerned about Airbnb renters who don’t understand the area’s fire vulnerabilities. “If these encampments are allowed to happen in the hills, then this is bound to happen, and it did.”\n\nThe day after the LAFD announced its finding that the fire was started by the homeless, L.A. City Councilmember Paul Koretz, who has worked closely with Miner on several initiatives, invoked emergency provisions of the city code in order to expedite a motion stating, “Encampments are illegal in the hillsides, and camp fires are prohibited in these areas. The City needs the ability to aggressively enforce these laws on land owned by the City of Los Angeles.” The motion called for a report that would identify encampments in the hills and include a plan to prevent trespass.\n\nSoon after the new year, the fire department counted 191 encampments in fire-prone areas of the county. Property owners will receive a notification in the mail if an encampment is on their land. For encampments identified on city land, the L.A. police, sanitation, and Homeless Services Authority will be alerted.\n\n“We want those people in these [fire] zones to voluntarily move,” Los Angeles Fire Chief Ralph Terrazas told the L.A Times. “This is a public safety issue; this is a trespassing issue.”\n\nIn another interview with the L.A. Times, Mayor Garcetti cautioned that given the topography of Los Angeles it will never be possible to detect every homeless person trespassing in a fire zone. “Just like ramping up efforts to try to anticipate terrorist incidents,” he said, “you can never get to zero risk.”', 'title': 'Los Angeles Blames Wildfire on Homeless, But Evicting Them Won’t Solve the Real Problems: Climate Change and Urban Sprawl', 'url': 'https://theintercept.com/2018/02/04/california-wildfires-homeless-climate-change/', 'keywords': ['wildfire', 'evicting', 'encampment', 'solve', 'sprawl', 'problems', 'homeless', 'la', 'fires', 'california', 'wildfires', 'wont', 'city', 'los', 'area', 'real', 'cause', 'urban'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': 'And more recently, research has focused on how wildfires are fueled by climate change, like rising sea levels and increasing temperatures.\n“We’re all for folks being safe, housed or unhoused,” said Eric Ares, an organizer with the Los Angeles Community Action Network.\nMore egregiously, last fall, a series of articles published by Breitbart News blamed the northern California fires on an undocumented homeless immigrant, based on no evidence at all.\nFor encampments identified on city land, the L.A. police, sanitation, and Homeless Services Authority will be alerted.\n“We want those people in these [fire] zones to voluntarily move,” Los Angeles Fire Chief Ralph Terrazas told the L.A Times.', 'date': 1517702400}, {'text': 'Thomas Fire near Los Angeles – dubbed the Skirball fire –prompted the mandatory evacuation of residents near the world-famous Getty Center.

Yet at the time, it was so far away.\n\n"We weren\'t particularly concerned," he said.\n\nWhat a difference a week makes.\n\nOn Monday, Hahn talked over the roar of prison inmate fire crew chainsaws on a nearby hillside and water-dropping helicopters making passes overhead as the flames bore down. By then, the fire had blackened more than 230,000 acres, making it the fifth biggest blaze in California history, and destroyed at least 786 homes and other structures.\n\nThe Hahns established Rose Story Farm in 1998 when they started growing 1,000 rose bushes on a half-acre of their lemon and avocado farm off of State Route 192. The lush property is nestled at the bottom of a canyon where decades of rich soil accumulated and where refreshing breezes — essential for roses — are common.\n\nThat experiment blossomed. The farm\'s 15 acres of rolling hills are now lined with 25,000 rose bushes comprising more than 120 varieties.\n\nMartha Stewart has highlighted Rose Story Farm, and it has been featured in prominent gardening magazines and features from news outlets alike. Danielle was honored with a prestigious Great Rosarian of the World Award.\n\nThen came the fire. Thomas marched down from hills belching thick smoke that created a towering plume. The air filled with soot. Ash rained down upon the famed European and pre-1950 American flowers.\n\nAs fire knocked at the door, firefighters from three engines came in pursuit about 1 a.m. Monday.\n\nBy midday Monday, engine crews stationed themselves to protect the garden and Carpinteria, a seaside city south of Santa Barbara. Inmates were defending the famed property, scraping and cutting fire lines while helicopters made water drops 100 yards away.\n\nThe team guarding the garden was among 76 crews — each consisting of about 15 inmates — assigned to the Thomas Fire Monday, said Scott McLean, deputy chief of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. There are 196 crews statewide.\n\n"They\'re a very fundamental part" of the fire containment effort, McLean said.

It forecast triple-digit temperatures in several areas on Friday and Saturday across several California counties, including portions of Los Angeles.\n\nHeading into the Fourth of July holiday, authorities are preparing for even greater risk of wildfires due to illegal fireworks or campfires. Several fire agencies across the Western U.S. plan to have extra equipment and crews on standby through the holiday to quickly respond to wildfires.\n\nAlso, several cities and counties have banned personal fireworks due to the increased fire danger, including Mesa County, Colorado, where fines for violations can run up to $1,000 and result in a felony charge.\n\n"Nationally, nearly nine out of 10 wildfires are human-caused, and fireworks definitely play a role in the number of human-caused wildfires," said Jennifer Jones, a spokesperson for the U.S. Forest Service.\n\nShe said firefighters are well aware of "the potential for wildfires as the forecast indicates continued hot dry weather across the region, and people will be recreating on public lands during the Independence Day holiday. The Forest Service is working with its interagency partners to be prepared for potential increases in the fire activity by strategically staging smokejumpers, engines, crews and equipment to reduce response time."\n\nAs of Monday, about 60 wildfires burned throughout the U.S. on more than 504,000 acres of federal, state and private land, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. That is up about 25 percent in terms of acreage from a year ago.\n\nIn California, at least 10 wildfires are burning throughout the state.\n\n"Right now we\'re over 300 fires more than we had at this time last year in California," said Cal Fire Battalion Chief Lucas Spellman. "We just didn\'t stop from last year, when we even had big fires in December."\n\nLast December\'s Thomas fire in southern California scorched more than 281,000 acres, a record for the state.\n\nThe largest blaze at present in the Golden State is the so-called County fire that began Saturday and as of Monday afternoon had exploded to 60,000 acres, according to Cal Fire. More than 2,115 crews are battling the blaze in three counties, Yolo, Napa and Lake, all now back in drought conditions.\n\nThe fast-moving County fire, fueled primarily by tall grass and brush, was 5 percent contained as of Monday afternoon. There\'s also the nearly 15,000-acre Pawnee fire burning about 40 miles away in Lake County. It started June 23 and so far has destroyed 22 structures and threatens 50 structures. As of Monday, Pawnee was 75 percent contained.\n\n"More land has already burned in California in the first six months of this year than during the same period last year," California Gov. Jerry Brown said in a release late Monday. "Cal Fire has already fought more than 53,000 acres of wildfire this year compared to an average of 23,000 acres over the same time in previous years.\n\nBrown also issued a statement with legislative leaders on the formation of a wildlife preparedness and response conference committee and plans to amend legislation to "help prepare the state to deal with the increasingly extreme weather and natural disasters caused by climate change."\n\nMeantime, at least eight wildfires are burning across Colorado and six in Utah. Crews also are battling blazes in eastern Washington and southwest Oregon.\n\nOne of the largest wildfires burning in the West is the Spring Creek fire in southern Colorado, which has charred more than 56,000 acres and as of Monday morning was 5 percent contained. Authorities believe the blaze was human-caused and Saturday announced on Facebook a Danish man had been arrested and was being held on arson charges.\n\nThe so-called 416 fire outside Durango, Colorado, has burned more than 49,000 acres. It started June 1 and was 37 percent contained as of Monday.\n\nSo far this year, a total of 29,111 wildfires have burned a total of 2,534,701 acres of federal, state and private land nationwide, according to the NIFC. That exceeds the 10-year average number of acres of 2,285,234 burned by this date but lags in the number of fires.\n\nFire experts see continued danger of major wildfires throughout the summer due to heat, dry conditions and millions of dead trees that provide added fuel for large blazes. In California alone, the Forest Service estimates there are about 129 million dead trees on nearly 9 million acres of land. Most of the dead trees are in the central and southern Sierra Nevada region of California, and insect attacks and drought are to blame for the high numbers.\n\n-Updated with wildfire information provided late Monday by California Gov.
