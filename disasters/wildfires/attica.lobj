After I passed by hundreds of burning cars and houses earlier today, I reached the yard where police said so many people had been found dead.\n\nI could see some of them lying on the ground as fog covered the place and a toxic smell spread through the atmosphere.\n\nMost of them were tourists who had tried to find refuge but did not make it.\n\n"I am calling my cousin but he does not respond," said Spiros Hatziandreou, who visited the spot.\n\nI could see flames in the trees and on the electricity poles all around. After that, police blocked access to everyone except rescuers.\n\nWhat happened in Mati?\n\nFire swept through the village 40km (25 miles) north-east of Athens on Monday and was still burning in some areas on Tuesday.\n\nDesperate families trying to reach the safety of the sea were trapped by walls of smoke and flame. Others died in buildings or cars.\n\nAfter the 26 bodies were found in an open space, Nikos Economopoulos, head of Greece\'s Red Cross, said: "They had tried to find an escape route but unfortunately these people and their kids didn\'t make it in time. Instinctively, seeing the end nearing, they embraced."\n\nDimitri Piros, director of medical services for Ekav, Greece\'s nationwide ambulance service, told the BBC people had suffered horrific injuries because of the speed of the fire.\n\nThe blaze struck like a flamethrower, he said, causing both smoke inhalation and skin burns.\n\nCoastal patrol boats and private vessels picked up hundreds of those who did manage to reach harbours or beaches.\n\n"Thankfully the sea was there and we went into the sea, because the flames were chasing us all the way to the water," said one survivor, Kostas Laganos.\n\n"It burned our backs and we dived into the water... I said: \'My God, we must run to save ourselves.\'"\n\nGeorge Vokas, whose family escaped by sea but whose house and cars were burnt, told BBC News that two women he had tried to help had died.\n\n"We\'re talking about a biblical catastrophe in this wonderful area of Mati," he said.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption This woman in Mati was trying to find her dog on Tuesday\n\nCharred bodies lay just 15m (50ft) from the sea, photographer Pantelis Saitas told the Athens-Macedonian News Agency.\n\nAt least 150 people were injured in the area.\n\nHow are the authorities responding?\n\nPrime Minister Tsipras declared a state of emergency in Attica, saying all emergency services had been mobilised.\n\nA spokesperson for the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Georgia Trismpioti, told the BBC some people had lost everything.\n\n"The death toll rises every hour, many people lost their loved ones, many people lost their houses, lost everything, and they will need long-term support in order to recover," she said.\n\nGreece has asked other European countries for helicopters and additional firefighters to help tackle the fires.\n\nItaly, Germany, Poland and France have all sent help in the form of planes, vehicles and firefighters, and Spain and Cyprus have offered Greece assistance, but with temperatures set to soar again, they are in a race against time to get the fires under control.\n\nHelp is also needed in Sweden where at least one person has been killed and dozens injured by forest fires there as soaring temperatures continue across much of Europe.\n\nThe wildfires are the worst to hit Greece since 2007, when dozens of people were killed in the southern Peloponnese peninsula.\n\nWhat caused the fires?\n\nFires are a recurring problem during the hot, dry summer months in Attica.\n\nOfficials quoted by AFP news agency have suggested the current blazes may have been started by arsonists looking to loot abandoned homes.\n\n"Fifteen fires had started simultaneously on three different fronts in Athens," said government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos.\n\nGreece, he added, had requested drones from the US to "observe and detect any suspicious activity".\n\nAre you in the area?

Nikos Economopoulos, head of Greece’s Red Cross, told Skai TV: "I was briefed by a rescuer that he saw the shocking picture of 26 people tightly huddled in a field some 30 metres from the beach.

The cause of the fire is currently unknown, but a dry winter created tinderbox conditions. Earlier today, Government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos reported that there had been more than 20 casualties, with more than 88 adults and 16 children injured. From the 156 people that were injured, 11 were in intensive care.\n\nGreece has been engulfed in some of the worst fires since 2007\n\nIn total, coastguard and other vessels rescued 696 people who had fled to beaches, with boats picking up a further 19 people from the sea. A spokesperson for the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) said: “The wildfires in Greece are northeast of Athens in the Penteli area and 50km west of Athens. “This area isn’t a main destination for UK tourists. People on holiday in the region are advised to monitor news reports and follow any advice or instructions issued by the local authorities, their travel company or their accommodation providers. “Anyone due to travel imminently to the areas affected should speak to their travel company or accommodation provider.\n\nCars have been left charred from the devastating wildfires\n\n“ABTA is in contact with the authorities in Greece and we are monitoring the situation.” French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted: "Our thoughts go to Greece and the victims of the terrible fires." Pope Francis said in a telegram he was deeply saddened by the tragedy and prayed for the victims and their families. Some parts of Mati were still smouldering with white smoke early on Tuesday.\n\nBurned-out cars were scattered outside gated compounds where three- and four-storey buildings had suffered fire damage. The intensity of the fire at Mati had slowed on Tuesday as winds died down but they were still raging in certain areas. Authorities also said they would be making use of an unnamed drone from the US to monitor and track any suspicious activity on Tuesday, with officials expressing misgivings that several major fires broke out at the same time. On Monday, Greek authorities had urged residents of a coastal town west of Athens to flee their homes as another wildfire burned, forcing the closure of a motorway, halting train links and sending plumes of smokes into the Athens sky.\n\nIt is not clear how many people have been forced to evacuate', 'title': 'Greece fires LIVE: 74 DEAD and 150 injured as worst WILDFIRES in decade destroy Athens', 'url': 'https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/993250/greece-fire-athens-wildfire-attica-greek-state-of-emergency-20-dead-70-injured', 'keywords': ['decade', 'athens', 'west', 'declared', 'injured', 'wildfires', 'authorities', 'greece', 'live', 'destroy', 'dead', 'area', 'sea', 'worst', 'travel', 'homes', 'fires'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': '"They had tried to find an escape route but unfortunately these people and their kids didn\'t make it in time.\nPrime Minister Alexis Tsipras cut short a visit to Bosnia because of the crisis and declared three days of national mourning.\nI\'m concerned at the simultaneous outbreaks both east and west of Attica.”Regional Greek authorities declared a state of emergencyHe has now declared a three-day national mourning period for those killed in the wildfires.\nHe said more than 600 firefighters and 300 vehicles are working to extinguish the wildfires.\nA spokesperson for the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) said: “The wildfires in Greece are northeast of Athens in the Penteli area and 50km west of Athens.', 'date': 1532452740}, {'text': "ES News Email Enter your email address Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email cannot be used.

have killed more than 60 people and injured more than 100 in Greece's worst fires in over a decade.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about where the fires are, how wildfires start and whether it's safe to travel to the Greek tourist village of Mati, near Athens.\n\nWhere are the fires?\n\nFires have been burning in the Attica region of Greece which encompasses the capital of Athens.\n\nThe first fire started in a pine forest near the seaside settlement of Kineta 30 miles west of Athens between the capital and Corinth, an ancient city.\n\nThe second major fire broke out on Monday afternoon in the Penteli and Rafina areas of northeast Athens.\n\nRafina is a port town popular with tourists, especially pensioners and children attending holiday camps.\n\nAt the centre of the disaster is the village of Mati, located in the region of Rafina, where 26 bodies were found in the yard of a villa.\n\nHow do wildfires start?\n\nHot weather riddled with drought and strong winds create the perfect conditions for a wildfire to blaze for weeks and possibly even months.\n\nAlthough wildfires can occur naturally, most wildfires are caused by human carelessness including the improper discarding of cigarettes, arson, campfires, not burning debris properly or misusing fireworks, matches or other flammable items.\n\nWildfires can also be triggered by lightning.\n\nFires are a common problem during the dry, summer months in Attica, and this week's flames were spurred on by strong winds.\n\nOfficials said the current fires may have been started by arsonists looking to loot abandoned homes.\n\nGreece forest fires - In pictures 40 show all Greece forest fires - In pictures 1/40 In this aerial view taken from a drone, showing the devastation caused by Greece wildfires, in

"We saw this in the wildfires of 2007 which was the last fire that had such a high death toll. Back then, we saw the same situation we see now -- a problem of coordination when the fire breaks out: no evacuation plan in place and nobody centrally coordinating."\n\nA Mati resident who did not want to be named out of fear he would get in trouble with the local authorities told CNN on Wednesday that locals had been requesting preparedness plans for wildfires for several years to no avail. "This was an accident waiting to happen," he said.\n\nBournos confirmed that residents had made such requests and said that plans had been produced by local volunteer firefighting organizations, but only for smaller-scale scenarios.\n\nFires across Greece caused dozens of deaths in 2007. Demetres Karavellas says that few lessons were learned from that disaster.\n\nEscape routes blocked\n\nThe geography of Mati and the surrounding area is also emerging as a key factor in the high death toll. Many houses were built haphazardly and with little regulation in forested areas and were therefore extremely vulnerable as fire ripped through the dry woodland, which consisted mostly of highly flammable pine trees.\n\nAdded to that, roads in the area are narrow and unsuited for large numbers of cars, according to Bournos.\n\n"We are talking about a densely populated area that was built without any urban planning," Bournos said. "Streets were not designed for such heavy traffic ... four thousand households and their residents tried to use streets that couldn\'t fit them all in."\n\nBurnt cars are seen in Mati following the wildfire.\n\nResidents spoke of being unable to leave the area by car as the fire approached because of congested roads. Photographs taken later showed streets blocked by abandoned, burned-out cars, some with doors left open, suggesting people who were unable to drive out of Mati had decided to flee on foot instead.\n\nAsked if authorities would be more prepared in the future if a similar fire were to hit the Mati area again, Bournos said, "There is nothing left to be burned now. Nature and houses have been totally destroyed. We are here, committed to rebuilding everything the way it was, but now with infrastructure."\n\nA satellite image of Mati taken in October last year shows how many houses were surrounded by flammable forest.\n\nLack of firefighting resources\n\nBournos cited the lack of sufficient firefighting forces as a problem. A second set of fires that broke out almost simultaneously in Kineta, around 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Mati on Attica\'s western coast, drew resources, Bournos said, leaving fewer available to fight the flames in eastern areas.\n\nHe also blamed the national austerity policies of the last few years, which have resulted in cuts to all public services.\n\nA firefighter works to quell the blaze in Kineta, west of Athens Monday.\n\nBut both Bournos and Karavellas cite the unusually extreme weather conditions that contributed to Monday\'s disaster -- high temperatures, strong westerly winds (a rare phenomenon in the region) and a dry winter that created tinderbox conditions.\n\nAs the global climate continues to change, this type of fire will become more likely, Karavellas warned.', 'title': "Greece fires: 'Serious indications of arson,' minister says", 'url': 'https://edition.cnn.com/2018/07/26/europe/greece-wildfire-mayor-intl/index.html', 'keywords': ['minister',

Credit: PCP Fire via Storyful\n\nWARNING: Some images may upset some readers\n\nEXTREME temperatures across the Northern Hemisphere have caused devastating fires from Europe to the US, leaving many dead and displaced.\n\nFirefighters battling the deadly, fast-growing Carr Fire in California’s Shasta County have witnesses a fire whirl, often known as a ‘firetornado’ or ‘firenado’.\n\nFootage (watch above) was recently shared by the Peardale Chicago Park Fire Protection District.\n\n“They say it was like a ‘firetornado,’” said Chris Corona, who lives in the area where the fire was burning, CBS News reports.\n\n“People started driving on the curbs, through lawns, everyone was running.”\n\nA firenado, also known as a fire whirl, is a whirlwind brought on by fire made up of flame or ash.\n\nA wildfire that roared with little warning into a Northern California city has also claimed two lives as thousands of people scrambled to escape before the walls of flames descended from forested hills onto their neighborhoods.\n\nResidents who gathered their belongings in haste described a chaotic and congested getaway as the embers blew up to a mile ahead of flames and the fire leaped across the wide Sacramento River and torched subdivisions in Redding, a city of 92,000 about 100 miles south of the Oregon border.\n\n“I’ve never experienced something so terrifying in my life,” said Liz Williams, who loaded up two kids in her car and then found herself locked in bumper-to- bumper traffic with neighbours trying to retreat from Lake Redding Estates. She eventually jumped the curb onto the sidewalk and “booked it.”\n\n“I didn’t know if the fire was just going to jump out behind a bush and grab me and suck me in,” Williams said.\n\n“I wanted out of here.”\n\nThe blaze leveled at least 125 homes, leaving neighbourhoods smoldering and 37,000 people under evacuation orders.\n\nRedding police chief Roger Moore was among those who lost their homes, the Los Angeles Times reports. The flames moved so fast that firefighters working in oven-like temperatures and bone-dry conditions had to drop efforts to battle the blaze at one point to help people escape.\n\nThe fire, which created at least two flaming tornados that toppled trees, shook firefighting equipment and busted truck windows, took “down everything in its path,” said Scott McLean, a spokesman for Cal Fire, the state agency responsible for fighting wildfires.\n\nFire officials warned that the blaze would probably burn deeper into urban areas before there was any hope of containing it, though it either changed direction or was stopped before it could burn into the core of the city. The fire was likely to regain strength later in the day when temperatures were forecast to spike around 43 Celsius and winds were expected to kick up.\n\nLightning and even a lawn mower have sparked devastating fires in the forests that ring the peaks and lakes. The blaze that broke out Monday was caused by a mechanical issue involving a vehicle, officials said.\n\nThe fire rapidly expanded Thursday when erratic flames swept through the historic Gold Rush town of Shasta and nearby Keswick, then cast the Sacramento River in an orange glow as they jumped the banks into Redding.\n\nGREECE BLAME GAME BEGINS\n\nIn Greece, which this week suffered the deadliest fires in decades, authorities confirmed autopsies had been carried out on 86 bodies.\n\nA blame game has also broken out over wildfires. Deputy Citizen Protection Minister Mikos Toskas claimed there were “serious” signs of arson.\n\nOthers pointed the finger at the government over its poor fire prevention measures while Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said he accepted “political responsibility” for the tragedy.\n\nHouses considered permanently unsafe were being sprayed with a red X signs, as structural inspections by housing experts were being carried out in parallel with ongoing house searches by rescue crews looking for more victims. Nikos Karakoukis, head of the Athens Forensics Department, said forensic tests have revealed the remains of three extra people.\n\n“There are parts of bones that are attributed to three people, so the number increases to 86,” Karakoukis said.\n\nIt was another indication of the intensity of the fire’s heat, which melted the metal hubcaps of cars as it swept through the pine-forested seaside resorts with winds of up to 100 kilometres per hour.\n\nGermany’s federal criminal police have sent a team of its forensics specialists to help in the process.\n\nDespite the daily rising death toll, Greek government officials have refused to acknowledge criticism, including claims of poor emergency planning ahead of the country’s annual wildfire season.\n\nOn Friday, however, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras sought to defuse the mounting criticism of his government.\n\n“I accept full political responsibility for this tragedy,” Tsipras told a televised meeting with his cabinet ministers. “It is an obvious thing for the prime minister to do and I urge you to do the same.” Rafina Mayor Evangelos Bournous said an evacuation wouldn’t have been an option, given the speed of the fire and the haphazard layout of the area, which featured small winding roads and cliffs next to the sea.\n\n“They speak of an evacuation plan. How can an evacuation plan be implemented on a settlement (built) outside of town planning, which does not have places for people to gather?” he said. “The evacuation plan was that everyone tried to leave all together and they got trapped on the coastal road.” Authorities have said the fire moved with such speed that ordering an evacuation of the area could have resulted in even more casualties. They have also said that the deadly fire may have been the result of arson, and are investigating the source of the fire.\n\nEUROPE ON FIRE IN HEAT WAVE\n\nGermany forest fires\n\nsweltered in near-record temperatures, forecast to reach as high as 39 degrees Celsius.

"I warmly thank (him) for the honesty and dedication he displayed during the discharge of his duties," Tsipras added.\n\nToskas — and other government officials — came under intense criticism from Greek opposition parties over authorities\' response to the devastating fire at the seaside resort of Mati, and for his assertion in a press conference that, despite considerable soul-searching, he had not discerned any major errors in how the emergency was handled.\n\nCritics focused on the absence of any official evacuation effort for residents before the flames reached Mati, on police allegedly allowing traffic diversions that sent motorists into deadly fire zone, and on an allegedly delayed announcement of the first deaths.\n\nToskas also initially suggested that arsonists could be to blame for the fire, although later indications suggested negligence by somebody trying to burn garden waste.\n\nEarlier Friday, the government said authorities will start demolishing dozens of illegal fences and other structures in the wider Athens region next week in a crackdown on structures built without permits.\n\nGreek officials are claiming that such structures were a major contributing factor to the wildfire\'s high death toll.\n\nEnvironment Minister Giorgos Stathakis told Greek radio channel 24/7 that 61 structures, mainly fencing, will be removed at sites on beaches, streams and areas earmarked for reforestation in several regions of Attica.\n\nThe Mati blaze was the deadliest in decades, in a hot, dry country where summer wildfires are a constant major hazard.\n\nHundreds of people fled to beaches, but even there the flames and choking smoke from the wildfire forced many to swim out to sea despite gale-force winds.

The response time to any fire, whether in a city or a forest, is critical. As we stressed in an older study conducted with Georgios Karagiannis at the Technical University of Crete, understanding the situation, gauging the resources required and assessing the mobilization time are the biggest challenges in any disaster response.\n\nWe also noted that delays in making crucial decisions are a common phenomenon. In this case, the announcement of a wildfire in a well-known high-risk area should have sounded the alarm for the instant deployment of more firefighting resources before the fire spread.\n\nThe outcome of any firefighting effort is determined by the initial response. French firefighters like to say that you can put out a fire with a glass of water in the first minute, a bucket in the second and an entire water tank in the third. After that it’s a matter of luck. In other words, the civil protection authorities need to predict the course of a fire and deploy the necessary resources on the basis of this assessment. If they wait for the wind to shift direction or for the fire to spin out of control, it’s already too late.\n\nThe accelerated response that is needed in terms of resource deployment in such cases is also necessary when it comes to the evacuation of areas lying in harm’s way. The fire should not be allowed to reach people’s yards before they are ordered to abandon their homes. Authorities need to have evacuation plans that factor in available resources and traffic flow on the national and secondary road network.\n\nThe media pointed to an absence of coordination and planning that resulted in a delay of more than an hour before the first firetrucks arrived in Kineta, western Attica. In the case of eastern Attica, the footage shows us that the victims tried to run to safety without knowing which way to go. It is likely that over the next few days we will learn of their frantic efforts to communicate with rescuers and find a path to safety before they died.\n\nThe response to a wildfire needs to be comprehensive, not limited to the firefighting effort. Right now in Greece, the civil protection authorities are focused on this latter aspect only, paying less attention to the protection of the population.\n\nSimilar incidents in Greece and abroad have shown clearly that evacuations, whether in a city or the countryside, need to be carried out before the flames approach inhabited areas.\n\nMobilizing volunteer firefighters and Red Cross medics in a timely manner is equally important.\n\nGreece has only a handful of areas that have carried out civil protection drills. It has no maps of its high-risk areas and possible escape routes, nor any kind of campaign for educating the public on the risks they face in their place of residence.\n\nFire growth simulation modeling systems like the US Forest Service’s FARSITE, used for precise operational and tactical planning, are intended to be used to improve response times and coordination, not just for the pleasure of researchers.\n\nWe tested the FARSITE system on a trial basis in 2014 when Greece hosted an exercise in wildfire management so as to improve coordination, decision making and the tactical deployment of water-dropping aircraft. As we saw from yesterday’s events, though, neither the Civil Protection Agency’s command center nor the municipal authorities in the area had knowledge of the possibilities offered by modern technology for planning the evacuation of densely populated woodland areas. There would have been fewer victims if a few simulations had been carried out in the area, because the authorities would have had a clearer picture of the challenges of an evacuation and would possibly have informed residents as well.\n\nCostas Synolakis is a professor of natural hazards at the Technical University of Crete’s School of Environmental Engineering, and a regular member of the Athens Academy.', 'title': 'Mistakes and oversights', 'url': 'http://www.ekathimerini.com/231040/opinion/ekathimerini/comment/mistakes-and-oversights', 'keywords': ['wildfire', 'protection', 'areas', 'response', 'evacuation', 'authorities', 'need', 'mistakes', 'resources', 'planning', 'civil', 'oversights'], 'tags': {'Fires'}, 'summary': 'Monday’s fires raged out of control, raising the question of whether the initial response was inadequate.\nIn other words, the civil protection authorities need to predict the course of a fire and deploy the necessary resources on the basis of this assessment.\nAuthorities need to have evacuation plans that factor in available resources and traffic flow on the national and secondary road network.\nRight now in Greece, the civil protection authorities are focused on this latter aspect only, paying less attention to the protection of the population.\nGreece has only a handful of areas that have carried out civil protection drills.', 'date': None}, {'text': "We Greeks have barely had time to grieve.

planes could help. The tweet has since been deleted.\n\nAt home, Greece’s far-right party Golden Dawn similarly sought to cover themselves in messianic glory. Members wearing party T-shirts appeared among the flames just long enough to provide a backdrop for their MP’s televised interview. He claimed they were filling in for a government he said had vanished. The true character of the Greek far-right was visible elsewhere. Three Golden Dawn members were arrested for looting the homes of the fire’s victims, while another 15 fascists attacked a group of migrants in Thessaloniki.\n\nBut the real heroes weren’t worried about capturing themselves on camera. As this unprecedented catastrophe unfolded, Greeks opened their homes and offered whatever they could to help those affected. Hundreds of people showed up to help distribute aid. Prisoners volunteered to prepare packaged food, supermarkets and cafeterias offered free meals and water. Roma communities donated their fruit and vegetable produce.\n\nGreece’s migrants rose above the populists’ vilification to demonstrate how humanity reaches far further than citizenship. Egyptian anglers were among the first to save those fleeing into the sea to escape the fires. Palestinians and Kurds donated blood to help hundreds of badly injured people in our hospitals, while the Syrian community led efforts to recruit search parties.\n\nThose the far-right would have us hate proved the politics of vitriol false. Abroad too, our supposed enemies offered help. Despite years locked in a bitter name dispute only recently resolved, the Macedonian government made a generous offer of six million denars to help those affected across the border.\n\nTurkey too forgot our historic rivalry. Turkish newspapers led with headlines in Greek in solidarity, while the Turkish word for Greece, Yunanistan, became the country’s top trending hashtag as Turks sent compassionate messages to Greeks. Turkey’s youth national volleyball team displayed a banner reading “we pray for Greece” before a match.\n\nThe last time our nations expressed such an outpouring of solidarity with each other was 19 years ago, when a powerful earthquake left thousands dead in Turkey. Greeks sent messages of compassion and offers of aid. A month later, when Athens was also struck by seismic activity, the Turks responded in kind. Those months are now remembered as the time of “earthquake diplomacy”.\n\nIt shouldn’t take a disaster to remind us that the enemy is not our neighbours, but those that seek to sow fear, hatred and loathing. Attica has shown once more that we have more in common than the artificial divisions created by hateful rhetoric and mistaken views of the past.\n\nThis week in Greece, that is perhaps beginning to sink in. Attica locals chased Golden Dawn members away from the fire, with one woman shouting she “wouldn’t even take water from fascists”. She made clear the town had no place for attacks on those who had tried to save strangers’ homes before saving themselves. The rest of Europe might want to think about Attica’s example before shutting its doors to those in need of help.

timely warning, along with environmental factors and town planning features, as some of the main reasons responsible for the high death toll and catastrophic spread of the wildfires in Eastern Attica.\n\nThe scientific team conducted mapping of fire affected areas and assessment of damage to the natural and built environment and based their calculations and conclusions on meteorological, remote sensory and drone data among others.\n\nThe fire is classified as a typical crown fire in wildland urban interface, aided by very strong winds which in turn led to “a rapid downslope spread towards the coast”.\n\nResearchers found that the rate of spread was also accelerated in certain locations due to dense vegetation, with significant temperature rise from stormy downslope winds and low humidity creating ideal conditions for higher velocity fire movement.\n\nThe rapid progression of the fire-front was recognised as a major contributing factor to the high death toll.\n\nBased on first-hand accounts, the report also points to the lack of timely official warnings, with most warning about the approaching wildfire having taken place only by word of mouth, leaving inhabitants and numerous visitors “almost zero time between realising the danger and reacting to it.”\n\nAdding to that, the area’s morphology with steep slopes along the coast impeded people from accessing the beach, while the town layout with narrow roads and alleys leading to dead-ends was deemed responsible for the haphazard vehicle congestion and entrapment of a great number of people.\n\nThe study also looked into the impact on the natural and built environment, noting that buildings comprising inadequate construction or non-fire resistant materials suffered the most damage, usually partial or total collapse.\n\nAccording to Greek newspaper Kathimerini, as fire victims and relatives of the deceased are preparing to take legal action, prosecutor Varvara Gnesouli plans to lift confidentiality restrictions surrounding communications between state services involved in fire fighting operations, in order to ascertain “who knew when it [the fire] broke out and when authorities were first informed about the deaths.”\n\nThe study was conducted by a research team affiliated with the university’s “Environmental, Disaster & Crisis Management Strategies” post-graduate program and led by Dr Efthymios Lekkas, Professor of Dynamic, Tectonic and Applied Geology and Dr Panayotis Carydis, Professor Emeritus in the school of Civil Engineering.\n\nThe authors acknowledge that “the cause of the

This fire, and others in the Attica region, have now destroyed at least 905 structures and damaged a further 740.\n\nSweden also battled the most significant wildfire outbreak in its modern history during the month, with economic losses of more than $100 million.\n\nMichal Lorinc, an analyst from Impact Forecasting’s Catastrophe Insight team, commented, “The month of July was marked by record-breaking heat, deepening droughts, and destructive wildfires in areas all around the globe. Nearly every major continent recorded some type of peril impact that will lead to a major cost to agricultural interests. In Northern Europe alone, the cost to local farming interests is expected to result in a multi-billion dollar loss in harvest output. All eyes are on the looming possibility of an El Nino return by the end of the year, which could exacerbate these types of impacts.”\n\nAdditionally, the Japanese extreme rainfall derived flooding event is now thought to have caused at least $711 million of insurance and reinsurance industry losses, much more in the way of economic impact and this is only a preliminary estimate.\n\nAlso in Asia, seasonal flooding in China has resulted in an aggregated economic impact of near $1 billion, the broker said.\n\nOn top of this a number of typhoons caused heavy rainfall, as well as some coastal and wind damage, with Typhoon Maria being the most expensive and causing $500 million of economic damage in China.\n\nThat’s not to mention outbreaks of severe and convective weather across parts of the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and China during July, as well as major earthquakes in Iran and Indonesia during the month.\n\nFinally, there was also flood events that occurred in Arizona and U.S. Northeast, Nigeria, Russia’s Far East, India and multiple countries in Southeastern Asia, including Myanmar, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Philippines.\n\nNot all of these events have estimates attached, but just the ones that do mentioned in this article (a mix of insured and economic) amount to more than $7.3 billion.\n\nAdd in all the others and it’s clear that July was a month of costly weather extremes and the resulting hit to insurance and reinsurance providers will be costly as well, with some level of impact possible to certain alternative capital providers and ILS funds, most likely due to the European droughts, California wildfires and perhaps the Japanese flooding.', 'title': 'Droughts, wildfires & floods cost over $7.3bn in July: Aon', 'url': 'http://www.artemis.bm/blog/2018/08/10/droughts-wildfires-floods-cost-over-7-3bn-in-july-aon/', 'keywords': ['losses', 'droughts', 'floods', 'insurance', '73bn', 'caused', 'aon', 'severe', 'wildfires', 'economic', 'impact', 'reinsurance', 'flooding', 'cost'], 'tags': {'insurance linked securities', 'wildfire', 'catastrophe', 'Articles about the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season', 'Insurtech, insurance technology', 'hurricane', 'Collateralized reinsurance', 'investment', 'alternative reinsurance capital', 'Reinsurance Sidecars', 'Articles about the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season', 'third-party reinsurance capital', 'Reinsurance linked investment', 'Reinsurance renewals news', 'capital markets', 'flooding', 'Retrocession', 'Protection gap (underinsurance)', 'Reinsurance Renewals', 'longevity risk', 'sidecar', 'ILS funds', 'insurance', 'reinsurance', 'Alternative reinsurance capital', 'ILS Funds', 'weather risk', 'insured losses', 'earthquake', 'drought', 'catastrophe bond', 'longevity risk transfer', 'weather insurance', 'insurance & reinsurance linked investments', 'cat bond', 'Alternative Reinsurance Capital', 'Insurance-linked investments', 'Articles about the 2014 Atlantic hurricane season', 'investment fund'}, 'summary': 'Impact Forecasting, the catastrophe risk analysis arm of insurance and reinsurance broker Aon, highlights these climate and severe weather extremes in its latest monthly report.\nThe extremes have caused “hundreds of deaths and a significant financial impact globally – particularly on the agriculture, forestry, water management, and fisheries industries,” Aon explained.\nSweden also battled the most significant wildfire outbreak in its modern history during the month, with economic losses of more than $100 million.\nNearly every major continent recorded some type of peril impact that will lead to a major cost to agricultural interests.\nAlso in Asia, seasonal flooding in China has resulted in an aggregated economic impact of near $1 billion, the broker said.', 'date': 1533859200}, {'text': 'Nearly 600 people have come forward to open their homes to a pet that lost its home or family in the Attica wildfires, the head of the Dog’s Voice platform for animal protection groups told Kathimerini on Wednesday.\n\n“We’ve had help from a lot of experienced volunteers at shelters, from concerned citizens and from dozens of vets offering their services for free,” said Elena Dede, who spearheaded the drive to help dozens of cats, dogs and other pets found roaming the streets or injured in the fire-stricken towns.\n\nTeams of Dog’s Voice volunteers took in a total of 49 animals on Monday night, among them a few from the Aghia Marina shelter in Nea Makri, while on Tuesday they picked up another 16 from Mati, as well as 17 from Kineta in western Attica.\n\n“The first stop is at a vet and they are then taken to the foster families, which we provide with food and medicines,” said Dede.\n\n“All of the animals are in shock.

cope with the deadliest fires in more than a decade since Monday.\n\nWildfires raging through seaside resorts near the Greek capital have torched homes, cars and forest areas, killing at least 80 people, according to the latest update by local authorities.\n\nThousands of volunteers and organizations have been mobilized to offer support. The response of the public was so great that the Central Union of Municipalities of Greece (KEDE) asked citizens on Wednesday to stop gathering food, water and clothing as there was oversupply and it was impossible to manage its volume. Medicines, blood donations and batteries were still needed.\n\nRepresentatives of the Chinese community in Greece meanwhile had gathered in a square in the heart of Athens and started to collect clothes, shoes, personal care items and money to buy medical supplies for the victims of the fire.\n\n"We are together, together we will succeed" was the slogan of the effort, while many Chinese like He Ai, owner of a travel agency, visited the affected areas to offer help.

Will anyone be able to save us if that happens to us?” These are the kind of never-ending questions that young children are asking all around Greece, which are largely going unanswered by parents who are themselves seeking answers following the deadly Attica wildfires of July 23.\n\n“My advice to parents is to minimize their children’s exposure to sounds and images that originate from the area of disaster, and, overall, keep them away from receiving excessive information on the matter,” psychologist Chryssa Karakana told Kathimerini, urging all readers and parents to pay heed.\n\n“We should all discuss the events with our children so as to give them a solid idea of what happened, without however exposing them to graphic images that feature explicit content,” she said.\n\nExperts say parents should also focus on the positive aspects, such as the brave victims who were able to battle their fear and save themselves, the rescue crews who fought hard against the odds, but also the many teams of volunteers who tried to help in the wake of the disaster.\n\n\n\n“At the same time, we need to keep a sense of safety alive,” Karakana said, adding that people should try not to express any strong emotions of disappointment concerning the authorities responsible for civil protection when youngsters are around.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, it is important that children do not develop a phobia toward fire.\n\n“We must educate our children so that they understand what can start a dangerous fire, how to eliminate or avoid bad habits that can spark a fire, and how we can protect ourselves in the event of a fire,” Karakana said.\n\n\n\nManaging this situation, experts say, can be a great challenge if the child has suffered the loss of a loved one in the wildfires.\n\nKarakana says that grieving is important so as to alleviate the emotional pain. Following the initial stages of grievance, parents or guardians can proceed with helping the child cope with the loss. It is very important for the child to be able to move on.\n\n\n\nShock and trauma are not exclusive to children.

Dozens of people - including families with children - have died as they tried to escape the flames.\n\nBut fires are also raging in Sweden, as far north as the Arctic Circle, and have caused huge damage in countries including Portugal, the UK and the US in recent months.\n\nSo what is happening to cause these infernos and how can we tackle them?\n\nFlames take hold\n\nFires can occur naturally in woodland or brush, ignited by heat from the sun or a lightning strike.\n\nHowever, the vast majority of wildfires - as many as 90% worldwide - are started by humans, according to experts.\n\nThe cause could be barbecue charcoal, a discarded cigarette or even arson. As long as there is fuel and oxygen available, the flames can take hold easily.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A strong wind blows embers in California\n\nGreece had an unusually dry winter and spring this year, leaving grass and scrubland particularly flammable, says Thomas Smith, assistant professor in environmental geography at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE).\n\nAs well as a lack of rainfall, wind also determines how devastating the fire will be, depending on its strength and direction.\n\n"Burning embers can travel quite far and start new fires that could spread for kilometres if they are big enough," says Smith.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption 23 July: Dry grass burns as fire crews tackle the flames in Greece\n\nSurface fires - burning on a forest floor, for instance - tend to spread slowly and can be more easily controlled.\n\nIn fact some surface fires can be good, says Cathelijne Stoof, a wild land fire expert based in the Netherlands. "It helps plants regenerate," she adds.\n\n"The problem is when the flames can climb up low level branches and get to the tops of the trees. That\'s when you can\'t stop it."\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption 15 July: Due to the dry weather, about 80 wildfires have been burning in Sweden\n\nThe most dangerous part of a blaze is called the head fire, explains Thomas Smith.\n\nIt is driven forward by the wind and is very difficult to fight directly because it has long flame lengths.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption 17 July: This aerial view provided by the European Space Agency shows smoke billowing from several fires between the west coast of Norway to central Sweden. Head fires burn with blacker smoke\n\nBut it is not just wood and grass that quickly become fuel for wildfires. Nearby homes and vehicles will combust because of the materials they contain, such as plastics and rubber.\n\nHazardous\n\nIn Greece, cars in the road caught fire before the surrounding verdant trees because they were more flammable. And they did not need to be directly licked by the flames to do so.\n\n"It comes down to the amount of energy given off by the flames," says Smith. "The cars could be tens of metres away and still be close enough to ignite."\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption 24 July: Burned cars are seen following a wildfire at the village of Mati near Athens\n\nSadly, people are often killed by wildfires as they attempt to escape.\n\nMany of the victims in Greece were trapped in traffic jams as people tried to flee as fast as possible, according to forest risk management expert Alexander Held. But this could have been avoided with better evacuation plans in place, he says.\n\nFine fuel such as dry shrubs should be cleared away from roadsides and houses to stop flames getting close, he adds.\n\n"This was a bomb waiting to explode."\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption 23 July: The contents of a home, including dry wooden beams, go up in flames in Greece\n\nHeat and flames are the most immediate dangers people face in a wildfire.\n\nHowever, smoke can also be harmful if you have an existing condition such as asthma or lung disease, or are exposed for weeks or months.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption 23 July: A road block is set up as smoke fills the air near Athens\n\nAlthough smoke from burning vegetation is toxic, it will usually disappear quickly.\n\nFumes produced by burning plastic or asbestos inside homes are much more hazardous.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption 25 March: Ruins of a house are out of bounds after a bushfire in Tathra, Australia\n\nAs well as changing climates, the differing land use over the centuries has led to more wildfires in some places around the world, according to experts.\n\n"There used to be small agricultural fields across Southern Europe and people would manage the land," says Cathelijne Stoof.\n\n"But in the 20th Century people moved away and the land became overgrown. So when you do have a fire it spreads much more easily."\n\nIn the case of the huge fire near Saddleworth Moor in North West England, it was not just the vegetation that caught fire.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption At its peak, the fire on Saddleworth Moor covered an area of 7 sq miles (18 sq km) and burned for three weeks\n\n"This fire definitely did get into the soil," says Dr Thomas Smith. The moorland is made up of peat soil, which is carbon-rich and needs little oxygen to burn, he explains.\n\n"The fire gets underground and smoulders away.... It makes it much more difficult to put out."\n\nFighting fire\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption 28 June: Firefighters tackle a wildfire with beaters on Winter Hill near Bolton, UK\n\nFirefighters have a range of techniques to try to tackle a blaze by depriving it of oxygen or fuel. They need to have the right training to know which one will work the best.\n\nIn the recent UK wildfires, they used beaters and water hoses to extinguish the flames.\n\nDropping water and fire retardant containing fertiliser from planes and helicopters may also slow the spread of flames.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption 7 December 2017: A plane drops fire retardant near a home near Los Alamos Road in Murrieta, California, last December\n\nExperts say one of the most effective methods of tackling wildfires is building firebreaks by clearing vegetation.\n\nBut this is "dirty and hard work", says Alexander Held, and not an option that is always popular in public opinion.\n\n"You can send a lot of helicopters and planes but without crews on the ground you won\'t put it out," he insists.\n\nCathelijne Stoof agrees on the importance of creating firebreaks: in some places firefighters will create controlled fires to draw the energy out of the blaze they are battling.\n\nAnd she says fire prevention and land management should be "sexier" than it is now.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption 21 July: Firefighters create a firebreak in the Stanislaus National Forest, near Yosemite National Park, California\n\nTeams with the right training can understand fire behaviour and choose the best way to respond, she says.

With the help of satellite data, five employees monitor existing or potential crises within the EU, around the clock.\n\nThis week, they\'ve more than had their hands full. In Sweden, massive forest fires continue to blaze out of control. And in Greece, at least 74 people have been killed in fast-moving wildfires. More than 150 people have also been injured, including many children.\n\nEfforts to fight the flames are ongoing — and the EU is presenting a united front. Sweden has had offers for assistance from Germany, Italy, France, Lithuania, Denmark, Portugal, Poland and Austria. Seven water bomber planes, seven helicopters, and more than 340 firefighters have been supporting the Swedish first responders. Germany alone has sent more than 50 firefighters, nine fire trucks and five helicopters to Sweden.\n\nWith the help of satellite data, employees at the ERCC monitor potential disasters around the clock\n\nBiggest firefighting effort in EU history\n\nThe EU says that it is currently involved in the biggest joint mission to fight wildfires in the bloc\'s history. "We’ve been working around the clock to help Sweden," said Christos Stylianides, EU commissioner for humanitarian aid and crisis prevention. "That is our duty in a Europe that protects its citizens." The fires in Sweden show that "climate change is real and that no country is immune to natural disasters," he added.\n\nRead more: Forest fires devastate western Latvia\n\nGreece is also getting assistance from other EU countries. Cyprus, Spain and Bulgaria are offering support in the form of airplanes, firefighters, doctors and vehicles.\n\nBoth Stockholm and Athens have activated the EU disaster prevention mechanism, coordinated by the ERCC since 2013. Founded in 2001, all 28 of the bloc\'s member states plus six other countries take part in the program, which oversees aid missions in the event of both natural and man-made disasters — including outside of the EU. Since 2010, it has been used to respond to the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, the Ebola epidemic in Western Africa, and the Syrian civil war, for example.\n\nFellow EU member states have provided Sweden helicopters to help combat wildfires\n\n\'They help as best they can\'\n\nWhen a government asks the EU for help, the ERCC passes the request on to the member states. If the disaster prevention mechanism is activated, the affected country tells the center what type of aid it needs. The participating countries in emergency missions depends mainly on each country\'s resources and experience in dealing with the relevant scenario.\n\nRead more: The global heat wave that\'s been killing us\n\n"The mechanism works on a voluntary basis," said Carlos Martin Ruiz de Gordejuela, press spokesperson for the European Commission. "The countries are not obligated to help, but they do it anyway. They help as best they can, with the resources they have available to them."\n\nGermany, for example, may not have water bomber planes at the ready, but can offer other forms of support in the event of wildfires. As Sweden doesn\'t have much experience with these sorts of fires, it makes sense for other countries to provide their resources and expertise.\n\nRoom for improvement\n\nBut the mechanism doesn\'t always work without a hitch. "In the cases of Sweden and Greece, we were able to answer the calls. But we have to admit that this isn\'t always the case, especially if you look at last year," said Ruiz de Gordejuela.\n\nIn 2017, the mechanism was activated 17 times for wildfires, according to the EU. But in seven cases, the call could not be answered.\n\nRead more: US park Yosemite partially closed as fire rages\n\n"When we get a call because of a fire, then there are usually fires burning in other places as well, which can mean that the needed resources aren\'t available," said Ruiz de Gordejuela.\n\nHowever, there are plans in the works to improve the service, especially with regard to financing. Currently, around half of the transport costs come out of the EU budget, while the expenses for the mission are borne exclusively by the member states. Initially, the donor state covers the cost, but the recipient state can reimburse the donors. In future, the EU may share in the costs of the missions as well.\n\nAnother suggestion for improving the disaster prevention mechanism is the strategic positioning of EU emergency personnel, who can quickly be in the affected area in the event of a disaster. Additionally, there are plans for further training and improvements to the exchange of information. This doesn\'t mean that the EU member states will have any less responsibility in future, however.\n\n"They will remain the key actors when it comes to managing crisis situations," said Ruiz de Gordejuela.', 'title': 'EU states join forces to fight deadly wildfires across Europe', 'url': 'https://www.dw.com/en/eu-states-join-forces-to-fight-deadly-wildfires-across-europe/a-44823614', 'keywords': ['disaster', 'states', 'forces', 'mechanism', 'deadly', 'prevention', 'fight', 'join', 'help', 'eu', 'wildfires', 'europe', 'sweden', 'member', 'countries', 'fires'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': '"We’ve been working around the clock to help Sweden," said Christos Stylianides, EU commissioner for humanitarian aid and crisis prevention.\nBoth Stockholm and Athens have activated the EU disaster prevention mechanism, coordinated by the ERCC since 2013.\nFellow EU member states have provided Sweden helicopters to help combat wildfires\'They help as best they can\'When a government asks the EU for help, the ERCC passes the request on to the member states.\nIf the disaster prevention mechanism is activated, the affected country tells the center what type of aid it needs.\nThis doesn\'t mean that the EU member states will have any less responsibility in future, however.', 'date': None}, {'text': "Video\n\nKaterina Pantelidis tells the BBC's Gavin Lee how she survived the devastating wildfires in Greece.\n\nHigh winds spread the fire, trapping many in homes and vehicles and forcing others into the sea as they tried to escape the flames.\n\nDesperate search for missing in Greek fire", 'title': "Greece wildfires: 'I jumped from the flames'", 'url': 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-europe-44948252/greece-wildfires-i-jumped-from-the-flames', 'keywords': ['tried', 'trapping', 'winds', 'survived', 'flames', 'spread', 'vehicles', 'jumped', 'wildfires', 'tells', 'greece', 'search', 'videokaterina'], 'tags': set(), 'summary': "VideoKaterina Pantelidis tells the BBC's Gavin Lee how she survived the devastating wildfires in Greece.\nHigh winds spread the fire, trapping many in homes and vehicles and forcing others into the sea as they tried to escape the flames.\nDesperate search for missing in Greek fire", 'date': None}, {'text': 'death toll from the devastating Attica wildfires climbed to 91 and the number of missing persons was confirmed to be 25, the government and main opposition party locked horns over the handling of the firefighting effort.
