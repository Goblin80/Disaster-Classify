Because every tree here was planted by us." ~ David Ben Gurion, Memoirs\n\n"Why are there so many Arabs here? Why didn\'t you chase them away?" ~ David Ben Gurion during a visit to Nazareth, July 1948\n\nFour days after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced plans to place thousands of migrant workers from Africa and Southeast Asia in a prison camp deep in the Negev Desert because, as he claimed, they pose a "threat to the character of [the] country," a burning tree trunk fell into a bus full of Israeli Prison Service cadets, killing forty passengers. The tree was among hundreds of thousands turned to ash by the forest fire pouring across northern Israel, and which now threatens to engulf outskirts of Haifa, Israel\'s third-largest city. Over the last four days, more than 12,300 acres have burned in the Mount Carmel area, a devastating swath of destruction in a country the size of New Jersey. While the cause of the fire has not been established, it has laid bare the myths of Israel\'s foundation.\n\nIsraelis are treating the fire as one of their greatest tragedies in recent years. A friend who grew up in the Haifa area told me over the weekend that he was devastated by the images of destruction he saw on TV. His friend\'s brother was among those who perished in the bus accident. Though he is a dedicated Zionist who supported Netanyahu\'s election bid in 2008, like so many Israelis, he was furious at the response -- or lack of one -- by the government. "Our leaders are complete idiots, but you already know that," he told me. "They invested so much to prepare for all kinds of crazy war scenarios but didn\'t do anything to protect civilians from the basic things you are supposed to take for granted."\n\nOn 3 December, Netanyahu informed the country, "We do not have what it takes to put out the fire, but help is on the way." To beat back the blaze, Bibi has had to beg for assistance from his counterpart in Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Western-backed Palestinian Authority and Israel\'s American and British patrons. Israel is a wealthy country which boasts to the world about its innovative spirit -- its US-based lobbyists market it as a "Start-Up Nation" -- but its performance during the forest fire revealed the sad truth: its government has prioritized offensive military capacity and occupation maintenance so extensively that it has completely neglected the country\'s infrastructure, emergency preparedness and most of all, the general welfare of its citizens.\n\nBeyond the embarrassing spectacle of Turkish supply planes landing in Tel Aviv just six months after Israeli commandos massacred Turkish aid volunteers on the Gaza Freedom Flotilla, or the confessions of impotence by the hard-men Netanyahu and Avigdor Lieberman, the fire exposed a terrible history that had been concealed by layers of official mythology and piles of fallen pine needles.\n\n"There are no facts"\n\nAmong the towns that have been evacuated is Ein Hod, a bohemian artists\' colony nestled in the hills to the north and east of Haifa. This is not the first time Ein Hod was evacuated, however. The first time was in 1948, when the town\'s original Palestinian inhabitants were driven from their homes by a man-made disaster known as the Nakba.\n\nMost of the original inhabitants of Ein Hod, which was called Ayn Hawd prior to the expulsions of \'48, and was continuously populated since the 12th century, were expelled to refugee camps in Jordan and Jenin in the West Bank. But a small and exceptionally resilient band of residents fled to the hills, set up a makeshift camp and watched as Jewish foreigners moved into their homes.\n\nIn 1953, a Romanian Dadaist sculptor named Marcel Janco convinced the army not to bulldoze Ein Hod as it did the scores of nearby Palestinian towns it had ethnically cleansed five years prior. He proposed establishing an art commune to generate tourism and contribute to the culture of Zionism. Today, the rustic stone homes that once belonged to Palestinians are quaint artist studios, while the village mosque has been converted into an airy bar called Bonanza. Visitors to the town are greeted at the entrance by Benjamin Levy\'s "The Modest Couple in a Sardine Can," a sculpture depicting a nude woman and a suited gentleman in a sardine can, which was unveiled by Israeli President Shimon Peres in 2001.\n\nAfter the catastrophe of 1948, the original Palestinians of Ayn Hawd set up their own village three kilometers away from what is today known as Eid Hod. For decades the villagers resisted attempts to dispossess them and were surrounded by a fence during the 1970s to prevent them from expanding according to natural growth. But they finally won official recognition in 2005. This meant that for the first time since the establishment of Israel they could receive electricity and trash service. Meanwhile, more than forty other Palestinian villages inside Israel remain "unrecognized." The 80,000 or so residents of the villages, which lay mostly in the Negev desert, are tax-paying citizens of Israel. However, they have few rights; their homes are routinely demolished to make way for Jewish settlements and they are deprived of basic services.\n\nI visited both Ein Hod and Ayn Hawd in June. When the residents of the Jewish village Ein Hod saw me filming, they reacted with a mixture of suspicion and hostility. "I know what you\'re doing!" an elderly woman sneered at me, insisting that I not film her. Inside the bar, I asked patrons if the place was in fact a converted mosque. "Yeah, but that\'s how all of Israel is," a woman from a nearby kibbutz told me as she sipped on a beer. "This whole country is built on top of Arab villages. So maybe it\'s best to let bygones be bygones."\n\nI provoked another annoyed reaction when I began filming a tour guide leading a group of elderly Israelis around the village. Speaking in Hebrew, the guide told the tourists as she took them through the art studios that they were inside "third generation houses" -- forget the Arabs who lived in them for hundreds of years. In the studios I noticed that much of the art being produced was Judaica kitsch for sale to foreign tourists -- generic shtetl scenes from the long lost, distant world immortalized in films like Fiddler on the Roof.\n\nLater, before taking her group to the town\'s Hurdy Gurdy museum, the guide mentioned a "welcoming committee" that vetted potential residents. Presumably this was how Ein Hod kept the pesky Arabs down the road from returning home. That and the Absentee Property Law of 1950 which placed all "abandoned" Arab property in the hands of the Jewish National Fund and the Israeli Land Administration, a provision that consolidated what the exiled Palestinian member of the Israeli parliament Azmi Bishara called "the largest armed robbery in history."\n\nDuring a break, the tour guide pulled me aside and demanded to know who I was. It was clear the villagers had grown wary of curious outsiders. Introducing herself as Shuli Linda Yarkon, a PhD candidate at Tel Aviv University, the tour guide told me she was the leading authority on Ein Hod. She said I had to allow her to review all the footage I shot, claiming that this would ensure that I not mistranslate words she used like kibbush, a Hebrew term that means "conquest" but is commonly used to refer to the occupation of Palestine.\n\n"So what about the conquest you mentioned?" I asked her. "Why didn\'t you tell the tourists who lived in the houses before 1948?" Visibly irritated, Yarkon remarked, "I\'ve concluded after years of research that there are really no facts when you discuss this issue. There are only narratives." She assured me that Ein Hod\'s Jewish population maintained excellent relations with the expelled residents: "Go ask them. They will tell you how they feel."\n\nSo I did. After following a winding dirt road around a hillside for several kilometers, I was inside Ayn Hawd, the Palestinian village. There was no installation art here, just ramshackle houses, dirt roads, a mosque with a tall minaret and lots of kids playing in the streets. Almost immediately some of the town\'s residents appeared from their homes to greet me. Abu al-Hisa Moein, a village council member and schoolteacher, invited me to spend the rest of the afternoon with his family on a patio beside his home, which appeared newer and more stately than those of his neighbors. He told me his ancestors arrived in the village more than 700 years ago from what is now Iraq. His relatives who were expelled to Jenin in 1948 told him they would be too angry to even lay eyes their former homes with the new occupants inside. When I mentioned the bar built into the old mosque, Moein shook his head in disgust. "It\'s very bad. It\'s an insult," he said.\n\nMoein took me inside his home for a tour, showing me the spacious, immaculately clean parlor and the picture window with a sweeping view of the valley below. He had built the whole place, he said with pride. Down a hall, his 13-year-old daughter, Ansam, was reclining on the floor of her room reading John Knowles\' classic bildungsroman, A Separate Peace. She leapt to attention when I entered and spent the next ten minutes showing me her library of literature. With night setting in, Moein and his family took me back on the patio. There, he unfurled a map of Mandate-era Palestine and ran his fingers over the names of scores of villages destroyed on the coast between Jaffa and Haifa by Zionist forces in 1948. He pointed to towns like Kafr Saba, Qaqun, al-Tira and Tantura, the site of a horrific massacre of unarmed Palestinian prisoners on the beach just one month after the Deir Yassin massacre. Moein was a history teacher, but Israel had forbidden him from discussing these events in his classroom, and is in the process of criminalizing any public observance of them.\n\nAs darkness blanketed the hills, I realized that I had lost track of time. I told Moein that I needed to get back to Tel Aviv. With that, his wife rushed into the house and gathered a bundle of grapes she had picked from a tree in the family\'s yard, packing it for me in some tupperware from their kitchen. Then Moein walked me to my car and hugged me goodbye.\n\nRedeeming the land\n\nBy now, both Ein Hod and Ayd Hawd are nearly empty. Most of their residents have fled for safer ground while the thousands of pine trees planted to provide Ein Hod\'s artists with a sense of solitude are reduced to ash. As the trees burn, the fire exposes another dimension of Israel\'s foundation that it has attempted to bury.\n\nThe pine trees themselves were instruments of concealment, strategically planted by the Jewish National Fund (JNF) on the sites of the hundreds of Palestinian villages the Zionist militias evacuated and destroyed in 1948. With forests sprouting up where towns once stood, those who had been expelled would have nothing to come back to. Meanwhile, to outsiders beholding the strangely Alpine landscape of northern Israel for the first time, it seemed as though the Palestinians had never existed. And that was exactly the impression the JNF intended to create. The practice that David Ben Gurion and other prominent Zionists referred to as "redeeming the land" was in fact the ultimate form of greenwashing.\n\nDescribed by Israeli historian Ilan Pappe as "the quintessential Zionist colonialist," the first director of the JNF, Yossef Weitz, was a ruthless ideologue who helped orchestrate the mass expulsion of Palestinians in 1948. Weitz notoriously declared "It must be clear that there is no room in the country for both peoples ... If the Arabs leave it, the country will become wide and spacious for us ... The only solution is a Land of Israel ... without Arabs ... There is no way but to transfer the Arabs from here to the neighboring countries, to transfer all of them, save perhaps for [the Palestinian Arabs of] Bethlehem, Nazareth and the old Jerusalem. Not one village must be left, not one tribe."\n\nAfter Weitz\'s wishes were fulfilled, the JNF planted hundreds of thousands of trees over freshly destroyed Palestinian villages like al-Tira, helping to establish the Carmel National Park. An area on the south slope of Mount Carmel so closely resembled the landscape of the Swiss Alps that it was nicknamed "Little Switzerland." Of course, the non-indigenous trees of the JNF were poorly suited to the environment in Palestine. Most of the saplings the JNF plants at a site near Jerusalem simply do not survive, and require frequent replanting. Elsewhere, needles from the pine trees have killed native plant species and wreaked havoc on the ecosystem. And as we have seen with the Carmel wildfire, the JNF\'s trees go up like tinder in the dry heat.\n\nBut it seems that nothing can stop the JNF\'s drive to "green" the land. Even in the parched Negev desert, the JNF is advancing plans to plant one million trees in a plot called "GOD TV Forest." To accomplish the highly unusual feat of foresting a desert, the Israel Land Administration has ordered the expulsion of the Bedouin unrecognized village of al-Araqib, home to hundreds of Israeli citizens who have lived in the area for more than 100 years and who have served in the army\'s frontline tracker units.\n\nThe Israeli government has tried time and again to force the people of al-Araqib into an American Indian reservation-style "development town," but they have refused. The village has been razed to the ground by bulldozers on eight occasions, but each time the residents have rebuilt their homes, hoping to outlast a ruthless campaign to destroy their way of life.\n\nWhat about the strange name for the proposed forest? It is a reference to GOD TV, a radical right-wing evangelical Christian broadcasting network that hosts faith-based fraudsters like Creflo Dollar and rapture-ready fanatics like Rory and Wendy Alec.\n\nAnd why is GOD TV bankrolling the JNF\'s ethnic cleansing campaign in the Negev desert? According to its website, "GOD TV is planting over ONE MILLION TREES across the Holy Land as a miraculous sign to Israel and to the world that Jesus is coming soon."\n\nIn his 1970 short fiction story "Facing the Forest," the famed Israeli author A.B. Yehoshua portrayed a mute Palestinian forest watchman who burns down a JNF forest to reveal the hidden ruins of his former village. Forty years later, as the JNF forests around Mount Carmel burn, right-wing Israeli lawmakers have demanded a search for the Arab who must have sparked the blaze, even though there is no firm evidence about the cause of the fire.

The plane has only been to one other country – Spain – outside of the United States in its four years of operations. Daniels added that based on the aircraft’s previous experience combatting massive forest fires it would have been capable of extinguishing the Carmel inferno earlier had it arrived in time. “Based on previous experience we could have stopped it,” he said. […] The Israeli government contacted the Evergreen company late Friday and within 12 hours it was already en-route to Israel. “The plane was in Arizona and the pilot and rest of the crew were scattered,” Daniel said. “But we were excited to get the mission and to be able to help out Israel.” Some reports have indicated that the government only learned of the plane’s existence from a random search on the internet. One Israeli Fire Service source said however that the plane’s existence was well known to firefighters but that they never imagined the government would pay the high fee to bring it here. According to some reports, it costs between $100-200 thousand dollars per hour of operations. Captain of the plane, Cliff Hale, said that it was an honor to be in Israel. He has flown the plane in Alaska, southern California and in Spain. “What makes our plane different is that its pressurized systems allow it to fly higher and faster,” he said. “This way we can get to scenes of fire faster.” By Sunday afternoon, even though it was clear that the fire was mostly out, the plane’s crew said they intended to stay as long as they were asked. “We are an insurance policy if the fire flares up again,” one of the crew members said.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calling the fire a “mega fire”, said he plans to set up a new squadron of firefighting aircraft.

The blaze broke out near Isifiya, in the Carmel region, on December 2, 2010. Spreading over large swaths of land overnight, the fire quickly consumed 5,000 hectares before emergency crews extinguished it. Firefighters were able to gain the upper hand only after four days. A large amount of fuel on the forest floor – dry material accumulated from a hot summer – hastened its progression.\n\nIt was a tragedy on both a geographic and human scale. Fourty-four people perished. When the smoke cleared, a shocked country was left grieving and devastated. After the funerals and memorials, Israelis considered their options.\n\nThe natural reaction for many was to begin replanting. The Zionist pioneers of Israel highly valued tree planting. This act fulfilled a very basic tenet of Judaism. Jews are obligated by the Torah to plant fruit trees to settle the land. Additionally, planting trees provides agriculture, shade, a haven for wildlife, and aesthetic value. So central are trees to Jewish life and philosophy that Jews refer to the Torah, their holiest book, as the “Tree of Life”.\n\nBut several ecologists warned that replanting too soon could be counterproductive as it may disturb nature’s own healing process. The Jewish National Fund and the Society for Protection of Nature in Israel managed to convince the government not to replant immediately after the fire. Their reasoning was that nature possesses far superior restorative abilities than man.\n\nResearchers studying rehabilitation of the Sha’ar Ha-gai (just west of the Jerusalem Hills) Forest Fire in 1995 concluded that replanting is not necessarily successful in accelerating forest regeneration. The Sha’ar Ha-gai study showed that areas which were replanted did not grow faster than areas left alone.\n\nThus, the government agreed to wait one year before making any decisions about rehabilitating the Carmel. The advice of ecologists from the University of Haifa and elsewhere was very influential in the decision.\n\nBut as we approach the anniversary of the Carmel fire, there is mounting pressure on the government to begin a restoration campaign. The forest, once a lush haven for hikers and nature enthusiasts, has become an eyesore. Large swaths of blackened treetops can be seen from nearly every vantage point in the area.\n\nThe Israeli Cabinet authorized $15 million USD for the Carmel area this past summer, including an outlay for reforestation. JNF crews have been active in the area recently, thinning brush and removing burned trees to ease the struggle of seedlings. They have also surveyed the area to determine where to plant oak, cypress, pistachio, and pine trees. The Carmel has the only population of Aleppo pine trees on the eastern Mediterranean coast.\n\nAnd a month ago, Cyprus presented the State of Israel with 300 trees as a gift for the Jewish New Year. After a ceremony honoring speedy Cyprian aid during the crisis, the attendees got to work planting the trees.\n\nThere is great momentum toward a full restoration effort. But the rush to restore could be a mistake. It could interfere with an important natural process. Experts remark on the forest’s adaptation to fire regimes, which have existed throughout the region’s history.\n\nProfessor Ido Izhaki, Director of the Carmel Research Center at the University of Haifa, says we need not interfere too much. “There are plant species [there] that have developed resilience to fire and those that have developed a dependency on fire, such as the Aleppo pine.”\n\nThe Aleppo pine cones actually require heat from fire to open. This process releases their seeds to the ground. “After this enormous fire, the Carmel will be covered with pine buds,” Izhaki says.\n\nThe once great Carmel Forest will return regardless of what we do. But its return should be heralded by nature, not by the desperate acts of men. What greater gesture of love for the forest than to leave it in peace?\n\nShare this: Email\n\nPrint\n\nGoogle\n\nLinkedIn\n\nReddit\n\nTumblr\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\n\n\nComments\n\ncomments', 'title': 'After the Fire: Israel’s Carmel Forest Doesn’t Need Our Help', 'url': 'https://www.greenprophet.com/2011/11/fire-israel-rebirth/', 'keywords': ['doesnt', 'forest', 'carmel', 'nature', 'replanting', 'help', 'israel', 'plant', 'need', 'israels', 'planting', 'trees', 'process', 'pine'], 'tags': {'forests', 'Travel', 'Israel'}, 'summary': 'A year after the fire in Israel, Joshua finds new life at the ravaged Carmel Forest.\nAdditionally, planting trees provides agriculture, shade, a haven for wildlife, and aesthetic value.\nThey have also surveyed the area to determine where to plant oak, cypress, pistachio, and pine trees.\nThe Carmel has the only population of Aleppo pine trees on the eastern Mediterranean coast.\nThe once great Carmel Forest will return regardless of what we do.', 'date': None}, {'text': "The dozens of wildfires that continue to rage across Israel have burned more territory than the massive 2010 forest fire on Mount Carmel, the Nature and Parks Authority said over the weekend.\n\nSince Tuesday, some 130,000 dunams (32,124 acres) have been destroyed, approximately 30 percent more than the blaze in the forests around Haifa six years ago.\n\nTo date, the majority of the affected land is the Judean Hills, outside Jerusalem, and the Kfir natural reserve, a report in the Ynet news site said.

Even the Palestinian Authority pitched in with firefighting units.\n\nSuspicions of arson persisted on day two of the blaze as it rampaged through the Carmel Forest near Haifa, Israel\'s third-largest city. Police said small brush fires that broke out Friday appeared to have been deliberately set, though police chief David Cohen said it was possible the main fire erupted because of carelessness.\n\nAnguished families began burying the 41 dead — most of them prison guards who perished Thursday when the blaze engulfed a bus that was transporting them to evacuate a prison. Fewer than half had been identified by late Friday because bodies had been burned beyond recognition.\n\nThe human tragedy was compounded by the loss of precious woodland in a country where only 7 percent of the land is forested. Tree-planting has an almost mystical quality here: For decades, Jews the world over have dropped coins into blue-and-white boxes of the Jewish National Fund, which has planted 240 million trees in the Carmel Forest and elsewhere across Israel since its founding in 1901.\n\nThough the scorched woodland covered an area of only about eight square miles — or some 1 percent of Israel\'s forest land — the fire was felt as a deep national loss.\n\nOutside Haifa, wind-driven flames towering nearly 100 feet turned the sky crimson as they spread across hilly pine forest toward the Mediterranean Sea.

"It is not enough for a large-scale fire."\n\nSome 100 firefighters from Bulgaria arrived as well as fire extinguishing planes and crews from Greece, Britain and Cyprus, Israeli officials said. Additional planes were offered by other EU nations and Russia. The U.S. was sending a team of firefighting experts as well as tons of fire retardant and foam, and pledged to help with additional aircraft.\n\nPresident Barack Obama discussed the fire and expressed his condolences for the loss of life in a telephone call to Netanyahu from Air Force One after it departed from Afghanistan. Obama had made an unannounced holiday visit to U.S. troops there.\n\nIsrael\'s Mideast neighbors, Jordan and Egypt, also sent firefighters and equipment.\n\nNetanyahu thanked the many states that stepped in to help Israel, saying the "one bright spot" in the calamity was "the solidarity of the peoples of the world with the people of Israel."\n\nThe message had special resonance in a country where people perceive increased hostility from a world eager to see creation of a Palestinian state.\n\n"The international response to our call was exceptional," Netanyahu said during a visit to the north. "It demonstrates that there is affection for Israel and identification with it from all corners of the Earth."\n\nThe help that drew the most attention came from Turkey, once a close ally but now a vocal critic — most recently because of a deadly Israeli raid in May on a flotilla bound for Gaza, the Palestinian territory run by Hamas militants. Eight Turks and a Turkish-American were killed.\n\nFor the first time since the raid, Netanyahu called Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to thank him for Turkey\'s help. "I am certain it will be an opening toward improving relations between our two countries," his office quoted him as saying.\n\nBut Erdogan was quick to reply that the help did not mean ties would return to normal and that his country still expected an apology and compensation for the victims. "If these matters are settled this could start a positive process for the future," he said.\n\nTurkey was not alone in setting aside tensions to help out.

With these new aircraft in its firefighting fleet there are now 14 Air Tractor single engine air tankers in active operation across Israel.\n\nThe story of this firefighting squadron begins in early December 2010, when the Israeli Air Force, the most combat-experienced air service in the Middle East, found itself on the losing side of a new kind of battle: wildfire. The massive fire began north of Haifa in the Mount Carmel Forest and spread quickly. Before it could be controlled and extinguished four days later it had consumed much of the Mediterranean forest covering the region, forced the evacuation of 17,000 inhabitants, and claimed 44 lives — making it the deadliest forest fire in Israeli history.\n\nThe human and environmental tragedy of the Mount Carmel forest fire brought home to the Israeli people and their government a stark, new awareness of the nation’s overall lack of readiness in combating the dangerous wildfires that have become more frequent following years of unseasonably high temperatures and prolonged drought. A response came quickly in the establishment of the Elad Firefighting Squadron.\n\nNamed in honor of Elad Riven, a sixteen-year-old Fire Scout volunteer who died tragically while battling the Mount Carmel wildfire, the Elad Firefighting Squadron was officially launched by Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu in May 2011. As a part of his remarks, the Prime Minister spoke directly to the young man’s grieving family when he said, “We salute you and the wonderful son you raised. One cannot always say about a boy who was taken after 16 years that he leaves us a legacy, but we can say it in the case of Elad—a legacy of infinite devotion to nation and state, a legacy of purity of heart and of clear, simple heroism.” Elad Riven was the youngest fatality of the Mount Carmel wildfire.\n\nSince its inaugural flights in 2011, the Elad Riven Squadron of AT-802Fs has completed more than 4,600 missions, accumulated more than 2,500 flight hours, and helped extinguish more than 500 forest fires and wildfires throughout Israel.\n\nThe squadron’s AT-802F air tankers are manufactured by Air Tractor Inc., at its Olney, Texas manufacturing facility. Designed from the ground up for aerial firefighting duties, the AT-802F combines agility, performance, high reliability, and computer-precise accuracy.\n\nThe AT-802F ’s Pratt & Whitney Canada turbine engine gives the aircraft ample power to nimbly maneuver in hot, high elevations and fly at speeds approaching 200 mph. That speed, combined with the flexibility to operate from remote strips, dirt roads, or small airports near the fire, allows the AT-802F to make a major impact on a fire very rapidly.\n\nA fast, high-volume loading system shortens turnaround times and makes it possible for the 802F to take on a full 820-gallon (3,100-liter) load and return to the air in as little as five minutes. Once over the fire line, the AT-802F can deliver a payload of retardant, foam, or water with extreme accuracy. The AT-802F’s agility and maneuverability in rugged terrain allows it to provide critical support to the overall firefighting effort by filling in gaps in the fireline and by making drops into deep ravines, narrow flight corridors and wildland-urban interface areas. Speaking shortly after a May 2011 wildfire in Jerusalem Forest, the Elad Squadron’s commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Rami stated that, “The smoke gave police and firefighters on the ground a lot of trouble, and that’s why our planes made such a significant contribution. This is an event that could have continued well into the night had it not been for our firefighting aircraft.”\n\nElbit Systems’ operational contract with the Israeli Ministry of Defense will be performed over an eight-year period, and covers flight hours, infrastructure upgrades, maintenance, airstrip operation, handling of fire retardants and other aspects of operating the fleet of firebombers.

The winter before, Kodas, who was living in Connecticut at the time, had joined a firefighting crew organized by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection. As federal lands in the West burned, the federal government had called in help from firefighters across the country and overseas. Kodas got one week of training when he signed up for the crew in the winter, but that was it before he made his way to the front lines of a long-running battle on U.S. soil: the war on wildfire.\n\nKodas had been drawn to wildfire for years by the time he made his way to Crazy Woman Mountain. While living and working in Kansas he’d watched the “red buffalo” roam the open plains, paradoxically nourishing the soil it scorched. As a fresh-on-the-job photojournalist at north-central Connecticut’s Journal Inquirer in the late ’80s, Kodas chased some action he’d heard on the newsroom police scanner and wound up watching inmates fight a wildfire on prison grounds. It was then he began to wonder if he could join the war on wildfire, though it would be more than 15 years before he did just that.\n\nAfter a decade-long, award-winning career as a photojournalist at the Hartford Courant, Kodas moved to Boulder, Colorado in 2010 to spend a year working on a project as a Scripp’s Fellow at the University of Colorado’s Center for Environmental Journalism. Colorado welcomed Kodas and his wife Carolyn with the Fourmile Canyon Fire that filled Boulder’s skies with smoke and lapped thirstily at the western edges of the city.\n\nNo surprise, Kodas’ fellowship project was centered on wildfire.\n\nHe intended to look at “The Big Burn” of 1910, the largest wildfire in American history, tearing through some 3 million acres of land across Washington, Idaho and Montana in just two days. The blaze killed 87 people, most of them firefighters.\n\nThe Big Burn was a turning point in national fire policy; the nascent U.S. Forest Service (formed in 1905) believed the tragedy could have been prevented if more men and equipment were available, and more importantly, they convinced Congress that total fire suppression was the only answer.\n\nThe American government, Kodas says, began treating fire “like a species we could eradicate if we wanted to.”\n\nHere are the origins of Smokey the Bear, of cooperative firefighting like what Kodas joined some 75 years later, of elite fire suppression “hotshot” crews eventually forming across the nation, of land management practices that led to forests overloaded with vegetation, deprived of cleansing, life-giving wildfire.\n\nMichael Kodas\n\nHere are the origins of the so-called megafires we see today: the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires in Australia, the Mount Carmel Fire of 2010 in Israel, the Waldo Canyon Fire in Colorado in 2012. These are fires that are burning hotter, faster, longer and bigger than wildfires of the past.\n\nAs for Kodas’ fellowship project, Timothy Egan beat him to the punch with his book The Big Burn: Teddy Roosevelt and the Fire that Saved America. But Kodas had found new questions he wanted to answer: what defines a megafire, what drives them and how are they affecting humans the world over?\n\nThe Forest Service has defined a megafire as any fire bigger than 100,000 acres, but it was a small fire in Arizona in 2013 that helped Kodas build his own definition of a megafire. In July of that year, 19 firefighters — the Granite Mountain Hotshots, the nation’s only hotshot crew managed by a municipality — burned to death fighting a small fire on Yarnell Hill in Prescott. It was the greatest number of professional wildland firefighters killed in U.S. history, caused by a fire that only consumed 8,400 acres.\n\n“Particularly with the Granite Mountain Hotshots’ deaths, I started to think differently about the definition of a megafire,” Kodas says.\n\n“I made 11 or 12 trips down [to Prescott, Arizona,] for reporting. … I began to look at the idea of a megafire as something we should be measuring by impacts rather than by size or intensity or speed. And those impacts are affected by the changes we are seeing.”\n\nLike how many wildfires are now burning intensely through the night (when before wildland crews could count on the cool temperatures and moisture of the night to quell a burn), or how fires are now burning quickly uphill.\n\nIn Megafire, Kodas distills years of research and thousands of miles of travel — to Israel, Greece, Indonesia and Australia, as well as domestically — into a story that examines what he found to be the four main drivers behind, as he writes, “charred forests around the world.”\n\nFirst, the use and management of forests has created unhealthy, over-vegetated landscapes. Additionally, and something Front Range residents are familiar with, increased development into flammable landscapes provides more fuel and fills forests with human-produced sparks and heat. Global warming has also expanded the wildfire season by several months across the globe.\n\nPerhaps most interesting though is the way political and economic decisions intended to suppress wildfires drive the flames as much as they put them out.\n\n“The U.S. spent about $300 million a year in the early 1990s on wildfire, and now in bad years they easily go over $3 billion in funding for fire suppression but also in preparing for wildfires, fuel treatments, recovery after wildfires burn,” Kodas says. “And most of that money goes to the private sector. So you have a bunch of industries that have built up around wildfire, and obviously an industry wants to work. They want to fight every fire that they can, even ones that would be beneficial to our forests if we let them burn or if we managed them differently. That’s led to any number of horrible scandals and corruption,” some of which Kodas details in the book.\n\nWe can’t undo what’s done, Kodas says. Immediately cutting out all greenhouse gas emissions won’t stop these megafires from burning. That ship has sailed. What we have to do, he says, is change our perspective. The forests have to burn sometimes, and we have to get out of the fire’s way. We have to learn to live with smoke in the skies and blackened forests from time to time. It’s just natural.\n\nRod Moraga, a fire analyst who lost his home in the Fourmile Canyon Fire, put it to Kodas like this once:\n\n“The first mistake we make is saying, ‘We’re going to fight it,’ because we have values systems, we have something to fight for. The other side is a natural process. There’s no winning or losing for it. It just does what it does. It doesn’t celebrate if it destroys a bunch of homes or destroys a forest, and it doesn’t weep if we beat it. Having this attitude of fighting it is counterproductive.”\n\nEditor’s note: Caitlin Rockett studied under Michael Kodas as a graduate student at the University of Colorado and contributed research to Megafire.
